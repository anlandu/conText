Dear Angela,

May I dedicate this little book to you, who are already a friend of the
Maid?

As you grow up you will meet certain wise people who will tell you that
there was never any such person as Joan of Arc, or that, if she ever
lived, she was mad, or an impostor. If you ask them how they know
that, they will probably reply that Science is the source of their
information. You can then answer that you prefer to begin with History,
and ask these wise people if they have read even so much as Monsieur
Quicheratâs five volumes containing the Trial of Joan, and the evidence
of her friends and enemies who knew her in her lifetime? As the
books are in Latin and Old French, the people who speak about Joan
disrespectfully have not read them, and do not know what they are
talking about.

THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC




CHAPTER I. THE CHILDHOOD OF JOAN OF ARC

|JOAN OF ARC was perhaps the most wonderful person who ever lived in the
world. The story of her life is so strange that we could scarcely believe
it to be true, if ali that happened to her had not been told by people
in a court of law, and written down by her deadly enemies, while she was
still alive. She was burned to deach when she was only nineteen: she was
not seventeen when she first led the armies of France to victory, and
delivered her country from the English.

Joan was the daughter of a poor man, in a little country village. She
had never learned to read, or write, or mount a horse. Yet she was so
wise that many learned men could not puzzle her by questions: she was
one of the best riders in France; one of the most skilled in aiming
cannons, and so great a general that she defeated the English again and
again, and her army was never beaten till her King deserted her. She
was so brave that severe wounds could not stop her from leading on
her soldiers, and so tender-hearted that she would comfort the wounded
English on the field of battle, and protect them from cruelty. She was
so good that her enemies could not find one true story to tell against
her in the least thing; and she was so modest that in the height of her
glory she was wishing to be at home in her fatherâs cottage, sewing or
spinning beside her mother.

Joan, who was born at Domremy, in the east of France, on January 6,
1412, lived in a very unhappy time. For nearly a hundred years the kings
of England had been trying to make themselves kings of France, just as
they had been trying to make themselves kings of Scotland. Perhaps they
might have succeeded, if they had confined themselves to one conquest at
a time. But they left Scotland alone while they were attacking France,
and then Scotland sent armies to help the French, as at other times the
French sent armies to help Scotland.

Eight years before Joan was born a sad thing happened to her country.
Henry V. of England had married the Princess Katherine of France, and
the French, or some of them, tired of being beaten in war, consented to
let the child of Henry and the Princess Katherine be their King,
instead of the son of their old King. The old Kingâs son was called âthe
Dauphinâ; that was the title of the eldest son of the French kings. This
Dauphin was named Charles. His friends went on fighting the English for
his sake, but he was not crowned King. The coronations of French Kings
were always done in the Cathedral at Rheims, where they were anointed
with sacred oil. The oil was kept in a very old flask, which was said to
have been brought from heaven, to a Saint, by an Angel. No eldest sen
of the King was thought really King of France, after his fatherâs death,
till he had been anointed with this heavenly oil at Rheims by the
Archbishop. It is important to remember this; you will see the reason
afterwards. Now, Rheims was in the power of the English, so the Dauphin,
Charles, could not go there and be made King in earnest. The English
said that he was not the son of his father, the late King, which made
him very unhappy. We shall hear how Joan comforted him and made him King
for good and all. What Scots and Frenchmen could not do, she did.

In the meantime the French were divided into two parties. Some sided
with the Dauphin, Prince Charles; more, and especially all the people
of Burgundy, and the Duke of Burgundy, a great and rich country, were on
the side of the English. So they fought very cruelly, for the land was
full of companies of ill-paid soldiers, who plundered the poor, so that
towns fell into decay, many fields were empty of sheep and cows, and the
roads became covered with grass. In the villages a boy used to watch
all day, from the spire of the church, to see whether any soldiers were
riding up. If they came, the cattle were driven into the woods, and men,
women, and children ran to hide themselves, carrying such things away as
they could. The soldiers of all sorts robbed equally, for they had often
no regular pay, and the Scots were not behindhand in helping themselves
wherever they went. Even gentlemen and knights became chiefs of troops
of robbers, so that, whoever won in the wars, the country people were
always being plundered.

In the middle of these miseries Joan was born, in a village where almost
everybody was on the side of the Dauphin: the right side. In the village
nearest to hers, Maxey, the people took the English side, and the boys
of the two places had pitched battles with sticks and stones. It is true
that they would have found some other reason for fighting, even if the
English had not been in France. Joan used to see her brothers, Peter and
John, come home from these battles with their noses bleeding, and with
black eyes, but she did not take part herself in these wars.

Her village was near a strong-walled town called Vaucouleurs, which was
on the side of the Dauphin. When Joan was a little girl she did not see
very much of the cruelty of the soldiers; the village was only visited
once or twice by enemies. But she heard of what was going on in the rest
of France: âthere was great pity in France,â she said. She did, once
or twice, see some of the âpity.â There was a man called Henry dâOrly,
living in a castle named Doulevant, who, like many other gentlemen in
these days, was a captain of robbers.

One day several spearmen of his rode into Domremy, Joanâs village, and
seized Joanâs fatherâs cows, with all the other cows that they could
find, just as the Scotts, Elliots, and Armstrongs used to ride across
the Border and drive the cattle of the English farmers. But a lady lived
in a strong castle rear Domremy, and when she heard how the village
people had been plundered she sent the news to a gentleman in the
neighbourhood, who gathered his spearmen and rode after the robbers.
The thieves, of course, could not ride faster than the stolen cows could
trot; they pricked the poor beasts with their spears, and made them
lumber along, but a cow is slow at best. The pursuers galloped and came
on the cattle in a little town, while the thieves were drinking in the
wine shops. When they heard the horses of the pursuers gallop down the
street, they mounted their horses and spurred for their lives; but now
came their master, Henry dâOrly, with more spearmen, who followed after
the cattle and the gentlemen who were driving them home. They turned and
charged Henry dâOrly, and cleared the road, and the cows came home to
Domremy, all safe.

Another time all the people in Domremy had to fly from home, and go to a
town called NeufchÃ¢teau, where they were safe behind strong walls. They
only stayed there for a few days, but, later, the English said that
Joan had been a servant in an inn at this town, and had learned to ride
there, which was quite untrue.

[Illustration: 0021]

There were beautiful woods near the village, and in one oak wood an oak
called the Fairy Tree. There was a story that a beautiful fairy used to
meet her lover at that tree, just as under the Eildon Hill, the Queen
of Fairyland met Thomas the Rhymer. The children used to take cakes, and
make feasts, and hang garlands of flowers on the boughs of that oak;
but Joan did not care much about fairies, and preferred to lay her wild
flowers beneath the statues of Saints in the village Church, especially
St. Catharine and St. Margaret. Of course, all this was long before the
Reformation in which the Protestants broke the images of Saints in the
churches, and smashed their pictures on the glass windows with stones,
and destroyed a beautiful statue of Joan on the bridge at Orleans.

These things were done more than a hundred years after Joan was dead.

Though Joan could run faster than the other girls and boys, and beat
them when they ran races, she liked to be quiet. Nobody could sew and
spin better than she did, and she was very fond of praying alone in
church. She would even go away from the other children into lonely
places, and implore God to have pity on France. The services in church,
the singing and music, made her very happy, and when she heard the
church bells across the fields, she would say her prayer. She was very
kind, and would give up her bed to any poor traveller whom her father
took in for a night, and would sleep beside the hearth She took care of
the sick, and, if ever she had any money, she would spend it on Masses
to be said in honour of God, and for the sake of menâs souls.

So Joan lived till she was thirteen. She was a strong, handsome girl,
beautifully made, with black hair. We do not know the colour of her
eyes, probably brown or dark grey. A young knight wrote to his mother,
when he first saw Joan, that she was âa creature all divine.â Jean
never sat to a painter for her portrait, though once she saw a kind of
fancy picture of herself in the hands of a Scottish archer.

Young men do not say so much about a girl who is not beautiful, and
indeed, armies do not rush together to follow a maiden with no good
looks. But though Jean, when she came to command armies, liked to be
well dressed, and to have fine armour, that was partly because she was
a natural, healthy girl, and partly because she was a kind of banner for
men to follow into fight, and banners ought to be splendid.

She took, no thought of her own beauty, and the young knights and
squires who fought, later, under her flag, said that they looked on her
as a sacred thing, and never dreamed of making love to her She let it be
known that she would never marry any one, while the English were still
in France. She was not a nun, and had not made a vow never to marry at
all, but while her country was in danger she never thought of marriage;
she had other things to do.




CHAPTER II. HOW THE VOICES CAME TO THE MAID

|WHEN Joan was about thirteen a very wonderful thing happened to her.
One day she and the other girls and boys were running a race for a crown
of flowers. Joan was easily the winner, and as she was running, a
child who was looking on cried, âJoan. I see you flying along without
touching the ground.â After the race Joan had a curious feeling as if
she did not know where she was and then heard a young manâs voice near
her bidding her go home, for her mother needed her. She did not know who
spoke; she thought it might be her brother, or one of her neighbours,
so she ran home. She found that her mother had not sent for her, and she
was going back to her friends, when a bright light like a shining cloud
appeared to her, and a Voice told her to go and save France from the
English. Till that hour she had been sorry for the sorrows in France,
but as she was only a little girl, she had never thought that she could
lead an army against the English.

This is the first account that people heard of the coming of the
mysterious Voices to Jeanne: it was written down about four years after
the Voices first came, and six weeks after Jeanâs first great defeat of
the English (in May 1429). Two years later, after Joan was a prisoner
of the English, the French priests and lawyers who took the English side
asked her thousands of questions about everything that she had done in
her life, and the answers were written down in a hook, word for word.
They asked her about these wonderful Voices. There were things that she
refused to tell these priests and lawyers, but she did say this:--

âWhen I was about thirteen there came to me a Voice from God, teaching
me how I was to behave and what I was to do. And the first time that
Voice came, I was afraid. I was standing about the middle of the day, in
summer, in my fatherâs garden. The Voice came from the right hand, from
where the church stands, and when it came I usually saw a great light on
the side from which it spoke. The Voice told me to be a good girl and
go to church, and go to save France. I said that I was only a poor girl,
who could not ride or lead the soldiers in the wars,â but the Voice kept
on for years, telling her that she must go.

She not only heard Voices, but she saw shining figures of the Saints
in heaven. She never would tell the lawyers much about how the Saints
appeared to her, but said, âI saw them as clearly as I see you, and I
used to cry when they went away. And I wished that they would take me
with them where they went.â

These Saints were St. Margaret, St. Catherine, and the Archangel St.
Michael. When Joan spoke to her own friends about what she saw and
heard they say that âshe seemed marvelously happy, lifting her eyes to
heaven.â This is all that we know about these wonderful things which
kept Joan company from the time when she was thirteen to the day of her
death, when she was nineteen, advising her about what she was to do for
the saving of France. If the Voices had not spoken to her often, she
would never have gone to the wars, and for some years she told nobody
about the Voices, and stayed at home in her village. Even when she went
to the wars, her friends could not persuade her to say more than I have
told you about these strange things. She said that she had a âcouncilâ
 which advised her in everything. If there was much noise in a room where
she might be, she could not hear the Voices distinctly. Only one person
said that he saw angelsâ faces in her company; none of her friends
who knew her best saw or heard anything extraordinary. She very much
disliked to speak about the Saints and Voices.




CHAPTER III. HOW THE MAID OBEYED THE VOICES

|TIME went on, and the Dauphin, the rightful Prince of France, was more
and more unfortunate. It is true that Henry V., the King of England,
died. He was a great soldier, and his son was only a baby, but the war
was carried on by the brother of the late King, the Duke of Bedford; by
the Earl of Salisbury; by the famous Talbot; by Sir John Fastolf, and
many other English generals. The Scots won a great victory over the
English at BaugÃ© bridge, where the Duke of Clarence, the brother of
Henry V., was killed. But the French and Scots were beaten at Verneuil,
where most of the Scots fell fighting bravely. However, a new army came
from Scotland, under Stewart of Dam-ley, and still the war went on.

By that time the Dauphin only held France south of the great river
Loire. The strongest place which was true to the Dauphin was the town
of Orleans. If the English could once take that city, and fill it with
previsions, and guns, and other weapons, the French could not hope to
win it back again, and the English would overrun the whole of the centre
and south of France, and drive the Dauphin out of his own country. He
was very poor and very unhappy. He could scarcely pay his bootmaker,
and as he was not a good fighting man, he lived here and there idly, at
towns south of Orleans, such as Blois and Poitiers. He used to wonder
whether he had not better give up the war and go to Spain or Scotland.
Another thing made him miserable. He did not know for certain whether he
had really the right to be King or not, as many people said that he was
not truly the son of the last King of France.

In his distress he prayed, privately and in silence, that he might know
whether or not he was the rightful prince, and ought to be crowned and
anointed as King. But he told nobody about this, and lived as he best
could, wandering from one town to another. Then he heard that his great
city of Orleans was being besieged by the English, in the autumn of the
year 1428. Orleans lies on the right bank of the river Loire, which here
is deep, broad, and swift, with several islands in the middle of the
current. The bridge was fortified, on the farther side, by two strong
towers, called Les Tourelles, but the English took this fortification,
and so the people of Orleans could not cross the river by the bridge,
and they broke down an arch, that the English might not cross to them.

One day the English general came to this fort, at the time when the
soldiers of both sides dined, to look our of a narrow window, and watch
what was going on in the besieged town. Now it happened that a cannon
lay, ready loaded, in a niche of the gate tower of Orleans that looked
straight along the bridge to the Tourelles. The English general, the
Earl of Salisbury, was peeping through the narrow window, thinking
himself quite safe, as the French soldiers in Orleans had gone to
dinner. But a small French boy went into the gate-tower of Orleans, and
seeing a cannon ready loaded, he thought it would be amusing to set a
light to the touch-hole. So he got a linstock, as it was called, lighted
it, put it to the touch-hole, and fired off the cannon. The bullet went
straight into the narrow window out of which the English general was
peeping, and he fell back, mortally wounded.

This was a piece of good fortune for the French, but there were plenty
of other English generals to take the place of Salisbury. The English
built strong fortresses here and there, outside the walls and gates
of the town, to prevent help and food and wine and powder from being
brought to the besieged French. But the people of Orleans were brave,
and were commanded by good officers, such as Dunois, young Xaintrailles.
La Hire, a rough, swearing knight, and others who became true friends of
Joan of Arc, and food was brought in easily enough.

The English had won so many battles that they despised the French, and
so they did not take pains, and besides, they had not men enough to
surround Orleans and prevent cattle being driven in from the country.
The English seem to have had no more than four thousand soldiers. They
were neither strong enough to take the town by storm, nor many enough
to surround it and starve the French into showing the white flag, and
giving up the place.

In fact, the English had been beating the French just because they
believed they could beat them, and thought that one Englishman was as
good as three Frenchmen at least. This was nonsense but, under Henry V.,
at Agincourt, a few English had beaten a great French army, because the
French fought foolishly, trying to gallop to the charge over wet, heavy
ploughed land, while the English arches shot them down in hundreds.
But the French, you will see had learned the English way of fighting on
foot, and could have held their own, if they had not lost confidence.




CHAPTER IV. HOW JOAN HEARD NEWS STRANGELY

|JOAN, far away in Domremy, would hear of the danger in which Orleans
lay, now and then, and her Voices kept insisting that she _must_ go and
drive away the English. She used to cry, and say that she would be quite
useless, as she could not ride or fight, and people would think her mad,
or bad, and laugh at her.

The Voices told her to go to the nearest strong-walled French town,
Vaucouleurs, and ask the commander there, Robert de Baudricourt, to send
her to the Dauphin, who was then far away, at Chinon, a castle on the
Loire, south of Orleans. When she saw the King, she was to tell him that
she had come to save France.

This seemed quite a mad proposal. Baudricourt was a greet, rough,
sensible soldier, and how could Joan go to him with a message of this
kind? He would merely laugh at the sunburned girl in her short red
kirtle--a girl who, probably, had never spoken to a gentleman before.

Perhaps this was the hardest part of Joanâs duty, for she was modest,
and she was very quick to notice anything absurd and ridiculous. Now
nothing could seem more laughable than the notion that a little country
wench of sixteen could teach the French to defeat the English. But there
was no help for it. The Voices, and the shining cloud, and the faces
of Saints and angels came, several times every week, and a Voice said,
âDaughter of God, go on! I will be with you.â

Joan had an uncle who lived near Vaucouleurs, and she went to stay with
him. It seems that she told him she must go to the Dauphin, and the
first thing needful was to get Robert de Baudricourt to lend her a few
men-at-arms, who would protect her on her long journey to Chinon. The
uncle must have been very much astonished, but it seems that he believed
in her, for he took her to Robert. Of course Robert laughed, and told
Joanâs uncle to take her away, and box her ears. But she came again, and
then a priest wanted to exorcise her, that is to frighten the devil
out of her, with religious services and holy water, as if she had
been âpossessed,â like people in the New Testament. But Joan was not
possessed, and the priest, after trying the holy water, could only say
so.

By this time the month of February 1429 had come round. The besieged
French in Orleans had now a great misfortune. The season of Lent was
coming; that is, a time when they were not allowed to eat beef and
mutton, but only fish, and eggs, and vegetables. Now a great number of
waggons loaded with herrings were being sent to feed the English who
were besieging Orleans. The general of the French in Orleans knew that,
and he determined to send out soldiers to attack the English who would
be guarding the long line of waggons full of herrings. They would wait
for the English on the road, cut them up, and carry the fish into the
town for their own use.

So a great many of the Scots and some French slipped out of Orleans
by night, and went to a place called Rouvray, on the road by which the
herrings were to pass. Here they were to be joined by another small
French army, under a general named Clermont. So they reached Rouvray,
where they did not find Clermont and his men, but did see the English
soldiers far away, marching by the side of the long line of waggons.

Instead of waiting hidden under cover till the English passed, by, and
then rushing among them unexpectedly, Stewart of Damley cried, âCharge!â
 and rode, with his lance in rest at the English front. The Scots were
always in too great a hurry to fight. The English saw them, coming,
arranged the heavy waggons in a square, and went inside the square,
so that the Scots could not get at them. Safe behind their carts, the
English archers shot down the Scots, who thought bows and arrows rather
mean weapons, and wanted to cut down their enemies with the sword. But
they could not reach the English; they fell in piles of slain men round
the square, and Clermont, the French general who was to have joined
them, would not fight, and took away his army. So very many brave
Scots were killed, with Stewart of Darnley at their head, and the rest
retreated sadly to Orleans, where they heard the English hurrahing in
their camp.

This was called the battle of Rouvray, or the battle of the Herrings.
It was fought on February 12, 1429. Now, on February 12, Joan went to
Baudricourt, and told him that a terrible misfortune had happened
that day to the army of the Dauphin, near Orleans. The news could not
possibly reach Vaucouleurs for several days, for the distance between
Vaucouleurs and Orleans is great, and the roads were dangerous, and
might be beset by English soldiers and by robbers, who would stop
messengers. Joan had been told of the defeat by her Voices.

At last, however, the bad news did come. Joan had been right, the French
and Scots had been defeated on the day when she told Baudricourt of it,
February 12.

So Baudricourt saw there was something uncommon in this country girl,
who knew what was happening far away, and he lent her two young:
gentlemen and a few men-at-arms to guide her and guard her on her way
to the Dauphin. Somebody gave her a horse, which, to the surprise of
all men, she rode very well. She had her long black hair cut short and
close, as soldiers wore it; she dressed in a grey doublet and black
hose, like a boy (she wore this kind of dress till the end of her
life); and then she rode through the gate of Vaucouleurs which is still
standing, and away to seek the Dauphin. This was on February 23, 1429.

After riding for several days, Joan and her company reached a little
town called Fierbois, near Chinon. Here was the chapel dedicated to St.
Catherine of Fierbois, who was a favourite Saint of the French and Scots
soldiers, and of Joan. In the chapel was a book in which the miracles
of the Saint were written down. At this very time a Scottish archer,
Michael Hamilton, from Shotts, was caught by some country people, and
was hanged by them. During the night a voice came to the priest of the
village, saying, âGo and cut down that Scot who was hanged, for he is
not dead.â However, the priest was sleepy, and he did not go. Next day
was Easter Day, and the priest went to church and did the services.
After that, he thought he might as well see about the Scot who was
hanging from a tree, and seemed quite dead. To make certain, the priest
took his penknife, and cut the dead manâs toe. On this the man gave
a kick, so the priest cut the rope, and took good care of Michael
Hamilton. When he was able to ride, Michael went to this chapel of
Fierbois, and took his oath that he had prayed to St. Catherine before
he was hanged up, and now he came to thank her for his escape at her
chapel. The book of the chapel is full of these strange stories, and
probably some of them were read aloud to Joan, who could not read, and
said that she âdid not know A from B.â She attended three Masses at
Fierbois, and get some learned clerk to write a letter to the King, to
say that she was coming. She also had a letter written to her father
and mother, asking them to pardon her for going away without their
permission. Her father she was to see once more, her mother she never
saw again.

As to Michael Hamilton, you may believe his story or not, as you like.
Many of the other stories told in the chapel book by Scots soldiers, and
French men and women, are just as curious. I only know that the people
made long journeys to thank Madame Saint Catherine in her church at
Fierbois, and that their stories were written down in the book there.




CHAPTER V. HOW THE MAID SAW THE DAUPHIN

|WHEN Joan reached Chinon, she was lodged with a lady who was very kind,
and she waited to see the Dauphin. His advisers were not sure that he
ought to see the Maid at all; but probably he was curious, and at last
she was brought to the castle, and led up the stairs to a great hall,
where were many men in splendid dresses. The castle is in ruins now, and
the hall has no roof over it, but you can still go in and see the walls,
and empty windows, and the great fireplace. A man plainly dressed was
in the crowd of magnificent courtiers in silk and gold embroidery. Joan
went straight up, and kneeling on one knee, said, âFair Sir, you are the
Dauphin to whom I am come.â But the man pointed to a knight, very richly
dressed, and said, âThat is the King.â

âNo, fair Sir,â said Joan; âit is to you that I am sent.â

[Illustration: 0045]

The Dauphin, for the man was the Dauphin, was surprised at this, for
she had never seen him before. He allowed Jean to come to the castle
and talk to him, but he was not sure that she was not an impostor, or a
silly girl.

One day, however, she took him aside, into a corner where nobody could
hear what they were talking about. When their conversation was ended,
the Dauphin looked very grave, and Jeanne looked very glad. She had told
him something that made him believe in her.

What had Joan told to the King? It was known at the time that she had
told him something that amazed him, for it is mentioned in a letter
written a few weeks later by Alan Chartier, a famous poet. But nobody
knew the secret: Joan would never let any one know. When she was a
prisoner among the English, the French-priests and lawyers tried to make
her speak, but she would not. It was her Kingâs secret.

Eight yearâs after Joan was dead, a very strange thing happened. A woman
who said that Joan had not died, and that she was Joan, came to Orleans
with Joanâs brothers. The people of Orleans, who had known the Maid very
well, believed that this woman was Joan come again, and feasted her
and gave her presents. Then she was taken to the King. He himself was
puzzled, and said, âMaid, my dear, I am glad to see you again. Do you
remember the secret between you and me?â

Then this false pretender to be the Maid confessed that she knew
nothing.

When the King was old, he revealed the secret to a friend.

On that day when they went apart together at Chinon. Joan reminded him
of the secret prayer which, as I told you, the Dauphin had made when
alone, asking that he might know whether he really was the son of the
late King, and himself the rightful King of France.

âYou _are_ the rightful King,â Joan said.

When the Dauphin heard her words, he made things go on quicker. Priests
were sent to Joanâs village to find out if she had been a good girl when
she was at home.

Then she was taken to Poitiers, to be examined by many learned men,
priests and lawyers. They tried to perplex her by their questions, but
she was straightforward, and told them how the Voices had come to her.
One man asked her to give a sign by working a miracle.

âI have not come to Poitiers to give signs.â said Joan; âbut let me go
to Orleans, and you shall see what I will do.â

She never professed to work miracles. She wanted to lead an army to
Orleans, and the sign to be given was the defeat of the English, and the
rescue of the besieged town.

For six weary weeks the learned men and priests examined Joan, and tried
in every way to find some fault in her answers. At last they drew up a
report and signed it, saying that âto doubt the Maid would be to resist
the Holy Spirit.â What they were afraid of all the time was that Joan
might be advised by spirits, to be sure, but evil spirits or devils. The
English and the French lawyers on the English side, declared that Joan
was possessed by devils. They thought that, because they could not deny
her powers; but, as she was not on their side, her powers could not come
from God, but from Satan. To think in that way is common: people always
believe that their own side is the right side. But nobody ever heard of
evil spirits taking possession of any one who was really good; and no
man could ever find any single bad thing in Joan the Maid.

So now the Dauphin began to collect an army to march with Joan to
Orleans. Of course he ought to have done that before, even if there had
been no Joan. It was a shameful thing that a strong town, full of brave
men, should be taken by four thousand Englishmen, without an effort by
the French to drive the English away. But the French had lost all heart
and courage: the brave Danois himself said that a large force of French
would run away from a little company of English. All that the French of
the Dauphinâs party needed was courage and confidence. As soon as they
believed in Joan they were full of confidence. They could not turn their
backs as long as a girl of sixteen ran forward in front of them, through
the rain of arrows, and bullets, and cannon balls, waving her banner,
and crying âCome on!â

At this time Joan prophesied that she would be wounded by an arrow at
Orleans, but not to death. So a Flemish ambassador at Chinon wrote to
the magistrates of his town at hone, and his letter was copied into the
town councilâs book, before the Maid went to the war.

White armour was made for Joan to wear, and a Scottish painter made a
banner with sacred pictures for her to carry: his daughter was a great
friend of Joan.

The Maid said that, as for a sword, if they dug in the ground behind
the altar at the chapel of St. Catherine, in Fierbois, they would find
a buried sword, which she wished to carry; and it was found, old and
rusty, with five crosses on the blade. The Duke of AlenÃ§on, a young
cousin of the Kingâs, who had been a prisoner of the English, saw Joan
riding one day, and was so pleased with her grace and good horsemanship,
that he gave her a very good horse, and became one of her best friends.
âMy fair Dukeâ was what she used to call him. Every one said that
Joanâs manners were as gentle and courteous as those of the greatest
ladies, though she had been brought up in a poor cottage. Everything
that she did was done in the best way and the noblest.




CHAPTER VI. HOW THE MAID RODE TO ORLEANS

|WHEN Joanâs army was gathered, with plenty of good things, and powder
and shot, in waggons, for the people of Orleans, she gave orders that
no loose people should follow them. The soldiers must not drink and
play dice and cards. They must pray, and must never swear. One of the
generals, the brave La Hire, asked that he might be allowed one little
oath, so she said he might swear âby his baton,â the short staff which
he carried as a leader. Then Joan mounted, and rode at the head of the
amy out of the gate of Blois. The French Commander at Orleans, Danois,
had sent to say that they must march up the bank of the Loire opposite
to that on which Orleans stands, for the English were very strong, with
many fortifications, on the road on the Orleans side, and would stop
them. Dunois seems to have thought that Joanâs army should go above
the town, and be ferried across with the supplies for the city-for the
English held the bridge--but that they could not cut their way through
the main body cf the English army on the other side of the river. But to
go straight through the English where they were strongest was what Joan
had intended. Therefore she was angry when she arrived at the place
where Dunois was waiting for her, and saw that the river lay between her
and the town of Orleans. You may think that her Voices should have told
her that she was marching on the wrong bank of the river: however, they
did not. She asked Dunois why he had ordered them to come by the road
they took. She said, âI bring you better help than has ever come to any
town or captain, the help of the King of heaven.â

Dunois himself has left this account of what Joan said, and, as she was
speaking, the wind changed. It had been blowing in such a way as to make
it hard for the boats to carry Joan and the provisions across the river,
but now it went about, and they crossed easily, some way above the town.
As for the army, Joan ordered them back to Blois, to cross by the bridge
there, and march to Orleans again, past the forts and through the midst
of the English.

Once across the river, Joan mounted again, with her banner of Our Lord
and the Lilies in her hand, and with Dunois at her side, and rode to the
town. They passed an English fortress, the Church of St Loup, in safety,
and the people came out to meet them. Night had fallen, and the people
who crowded round the Maid were carrying torches. Ore of these set fire
to the fringe of her banner and made her horse plunge; but she crushed
out the flame with her left hand in its steel glove, and reined in her
horse easily, while the people cheered, and the women wished to kiss her
hand, which she did not like, thinking the honour too great. It was a
beautiful sight to see the Maid ride into Orleans town. From that hour
there was no more fear among the French.

[Illustration: 0055]

Dunois said, âtill that day, two hundred English could scatter eight
hundred or a thousand cf our men, but now they skulked in their forts
and dared not come out against us.â This is an extraordinary thing, for
Talbot, who led the English, was the bravest of men, and was thought the
greatest captain living. Jeanne sent to him a letter to bid him break up
his camp and go away. The English laughed, and one day, when Joan went
out to speak to them, they called her ill names, so that she wept for
shame. But, somehow, the English had certainly lost heart, or they had
some reason which we do not know, for merely defending their strong
fortresses.

On the day after Joan entered Orleans she wanted Dunois to sally out of
the town with his men and assail the English. He did not think it wise
to do so and Joan went up to her own room. Suddenly she rushed down and
asked her page why he had not told her that the French were fighting,
she did not know where. It was at the fort and Church of St. Loup, which
Joan had passed on her way into Orleans. On this side, namely, farther
up the river, above the town, the English were weakest, as they did not
expect to be attacked on that side. The French were victorious:
when they saw Joan ride up they were filled with courage. Joan saw a
Frenchman strike down an English prisoner: she dismounted; laid the poor
prisonerâs head in her lap, and did her best to comfort him.




CHAPTER VII. HOW THE MAID SAVED ORLEANS

|THE Dauphin had given Joan a gentle-man of good character to be with
her always, and take care of her. This gentleman was named Jean dâAulon,
and, as he has left an account of what Joan did at Orleans, we give what
he said. On the day after Joan took the fortress of St. Loup from the
English, she led her men to attack another English work on the farther
side of the river. They could not cross by the bridge, of course, for
the English held the strong building, Les Tourelles, at the bridge end,
the place where the Earl of Salisbury was killed by the cannon shot;
moreover an arch of the bridge had been broken, lest the English should
cross. So they went in boats to an island in the middle of the river,
and then made a bridge of boats across the other branch of the Loire.
But they found that the English had left the place which they meant to
attack, and were in a much stronger fortress. The French, therefore,
were returning to their boats, when the English rushed out of the second
fortress to attack them when off their guard. But Joan and her friend
La Hire, who had crossed the river with their horses, saw the English
coming on, and put their lances in rest (a kind of support for the
level spear), and spurred their horses at their enemies. The rest of the
French followed Joan, and drove the English back into their fortress.
Meanwhile dâAulon, and a Spanish gentleman on the French side, took each
other by the hand, and ran as fast as they could till they struck
their swords against the outer fence, or strong wooden palisade of
the English. But in the narrow gateway stood a tall and very strong
Englishman, who drove back the French. So dâAulon asked a Frenchman, a
good shot, to aim at the Englishman, whom he killed, and then dâAulon
and the Spaniard ran into the gateway, and held it, while Joan and the
rest of the French rushed in, and all the English were killed or gave
themselves up as prisoners.

By this time the French army which went down to Blois to cross the
bridge, had returned to Orleans, and gone past the English fortresses
without being attacked. So there were now many fighting men in Orleans.
Next day, therefore, Joan insisted that they should attack the strongest
of all the English forts, Les Tourelles, at the end of the bridge
farthest from the town. The generals thought this plan too dangerous,
as the fortress was so strong; but no doubt Joan was right, because the
English on the town side of the river could not cross over to help their
countrymen. If they crossed in boats, they would be shot, and cut down
as they landed. If the French generals did not understand that. Joan
did. She was full of confidence. A man asked her to wait for breakfast,
and offered her a big trout caught in the Loire. She said, âKeen it for
supper. I will bring back an English prisoner to help to eat it. And I
will come back _by the bridge_,â Now the bridge, we saw, was _broken_.

[Illustration: 0061]

DâAulon heard her say this, and no doubt he wondered what she meant. He
understood her, at night.

So Joan caused the gate to be thrown open, and the townâs people, who
were very eager, rushed to the river bank, and crossed in boats. The
regular soldiers followed, and all day long they attacked the walls,
carrying ladders to climb then? with, while Joan stood under the wall,
waving her banner, and crying âForward!â But from behind the battlement,
the English kept shooting with arrows and muskets, so that many of the
French were killed, and a strong Englishman threw down the ladders as
they were pushed to the top of the walls. There were five or six hundred
of the best of the English in this castle, under two leaders whom the
French call âBumusâ and âGlasidas.â The name of âGlasidasâ was Glasdaie;
we do not know who âBumusâ was! So all day companies of the French and
Scots, carrying ladders, and with banners flying, went down into the
deep ditch below the wall, and were shot or driven out.

Now the great Dunois, the most famous of the French leaders, tells us
what Joan did. It was about one oâclock in the afternoon, when the
thing that she had prophesied happened to her. A bolt from an English
cross-bow passed through her armour between the collar-bone and the
shoulder-blade, and stood out six inches behind her shoulder. She was
carried out of range, and the arrow was drawn out. Another witness says
that a soldier wished to sing a magical song over the wound, to heal it,
but she would not allow this to be done, and went back into the battle,
hurt as she was. She cried a little.

They fought on: they had begun in the early morning, and it was eight
oâclock, and past sunset, when Dunois said that they could not take the
fort that day, and wished to call off the soldiers from the ditch. But
Joan came to him, and asked him to wait a little while. She mounted her
horse, and rode to a vineyard, and there she prayed, âfor half a quarter
of an hour.â Then she rode back, and went through the hail of shot and
arrows to the edge of the ditch, while dâAulon covered her, he says,
with his shield. She saw that a soldier had taken her standard into the
ditch. She seized the standard, and it waved so that all her men saw it,
and rushed up; âwe shall take the fort,â said Joan, âwhen my standard
touches the wall.â The wind blew the banner fringe against the wall, and
the French made one more rush, they climbed the ladders, they tumbled
into the fort, and the English were slain or taken, and Glasdale, their
leader, who tried to cross to another tower by a plank, fell into the
river and was drowned.

Then Joan crossed back to Orleans by the bridge, as dâAulon heard her say
that she would, when she set out in the morning. For the townâs people
laid a beam across the broken arch, and on this she walked over, after
winning so great a victory by her own courage. For Dunois says that the
English were terrified when they saw her under the wall again, in the
growing darkness, and that they had no more heart to fight.

Joan was very tired: she had her wound dressed by a surgeon, and, for
supper, she had four or five little pieces of toast, dipped in weak wine
and water: that was all she ate, Dunois says, all that long day.

Early next morning the English left their forts, and drew up in line of
battle. Joan had put on a very light shirt of mail, made of steel rings,
because her wound did not permit her to wear the usual armour made of
heavy steel plates. She said that the English must be allowed to go
away, and must not be attacked.

Thus the town of Orleans was delivered on 8th May, and ever since, to
this day, they keep a festival on 8th May in every year, ard rejoice
in honour of the Maid. All the expense and labour of the English in
the seven monthsâ siege had been turned to waste by Joan in four days,
France was free, south of the Loire, and Joan had kept her word, she had
shown a sign at Orleans.

It sounds like a fairy-tale, but it certainly happened. Joan made the
French able to do what they did merely by giving them courage. Her army
would not have come together if she had not given them something to
believe in-herself. She thought that she led about 10,000 men; but it is
not easy to be sure of the numbers. The English, if they were only 4000,
could not resist the new army and the old garrison of Orleans, if the
French had faith in themselves; and Joan gave them faith. At the same
time the English seem to have arranged their army in a very foolish way.
About 1000 were or the farther side of a river which the 3000 on the
right bank could not, or did not try to cross, to help their friends.
The larger part of the English army might have attacked one of the gates
of Orleans, and frightened Joanâs army, who would have come back across
the river to defend the town. The English in the fortress at the farther
end of the bridge would then have been safe. But the English on
the right bank did nothing at all, for some reason which we do not
understand.




CHAPTER VIII. HOW THE MAID TOOK THE TOWN OF JARGEAU

|AFTER Orleans was quite safe, and when Talbot had led the English army
to the town of Meun, Joan wanted to take the Dauphin to Rheims, to be
crowned and anointed with the holy oil, and made King in earnest. But
the way was long, and the road passed through towns which were held
by friends of the English. So the Dauphin loitered about in pleasant
castles near the Loire, in the bright May weather, and held councils,
and wondered what he ought to do. Then Joan rode with the brave Dunois
to Loches where the Dauphin was. Some lords and priests were in the room
with him, but Joan went straight in, and knelt before him, saying, âFair
Dauphin, do not hold so many weary councils, but come to Rheims, and
take your crown.â

So they said that they would think about it, but was it safe to leave
English armies behind them, at Meun, where Talbot was, and at Jargeau,
where the Earl of Suffolk was the English captain? Joan said that she
and the young Duke of AlenÃ§on would make their minds easy on that point,
and would begin by taking Jargeau, where the French, without Joan, had
fought already and been beaten. The Duke was newly married to a young
wife, who was anxious about him, but Joan said, âMadam, I will bring
back the Duke to you, safe and well!â So they rode away, six hundred
lances, with some infantry, and slept in a wood. The Duke of AlenÃ§on has
left an account of all that they did. Next day Dunois and other captains
joined them with another six hundred lances, so that, with the infantry,
they would be about five thousand men. Some of the captains thought
they were not strong enough, as Jargeau had thick walls and rowers, and
cannon. But Joan insisted on fighting and first she led her men to drive
the English from the houses lying under the walls on the outside, which
is dangerous fighting, as all the garden walls would protect English
cross-bowmen, and men with muskets, who could shoot in safety, many
of them from windows of houses, at the French in the open. The French,
however, drove the English from the houses and gardens, and brought up
their cannon, and fired at the town.

In these days cannon were small, and shot small balls, which did not
carry far, and could do no damage to thick stone walls. There were no
shells, which explode, but there were a few very large iron guns, like
Mons Meg in Edinburgh Castle. Out of these they shot huge, heavy stone
balls, and if one of them fell into a street, and broke, the splinters
flew about dangerously. But, somehow, they seldom did much harm, besides
Joanâs army had none of these great guns, which are not easily dragged
about.

So for days the French fired at the town, and it is to be supposed that
they broke a hole, or breach, in a part of the wall, for they decided to
rush in and take the place sword in hand.

âForward, fair Duke!â said Joan to the Duke of AlenÃ§on, who rather
thought that they had not made a good enough breach in the wall. âYou
know that I told the Duchess I would bring you back safe? But do not
stand _there_,â she said, âor that English cannon on the wall will kill
you.â

The Duke moved from the place where he was, and a gentleman named da
Luce went to it, and was killed.

So Joan saved the Duke, as she had promised.

Then they ran together to the wall, and Jean was climbing up a ladder,
when a heavy stone thrown by the English struck her helmet, and she
fell.

She rose again at once, crying, âForward, we shall take them all,â and
the English ran through the streets to the bridges, the French following
and cutting them down, or taking them prisoners. It is said that the
Earl of Suffolk surrendered to Joan, as âthe bravest woman in the
world.â If this is true, she might have made a great deal of money out
of his ransom, that is, the price which a prisoner paid for his freedom.
There is another story that Suffolk was taken by a squire, and that he
dubbed him knight before he surrendered as it was more honourable to
yield to a knight. This is more likely to be true, for the English
thought that Joan was a witch. Now, as Suffolk was general of all the
English forces on the Loire he would not choose to surrender to a lass
of sixteen, whether he believed in witches or not Besides, he could not
dub Joan a knight.




CHAPTER IX. HOW JOAN DEFEATED THE ENGLISH IN FAIRFIELD

|THE Maid had now driven the English away from Orleans, and had taken a
strong town which they held, a thing the French, without her, had failed
to do. She was next to beat their army In the open country and in fair
field. We know most about this battle from a book written by a gentleman
named Pierre de Cagny, who rode with the Duke of Alencon and knew what
happened, and wrote all down very soon afterwards. He says that the Maid
placed a garrison of soldiers to keep Jargeau, and then rode to Orleans
with the Duke, where the townspeople gave a great feast to her and her
friends. But she did not stay long to be petted and praised at Orleans.
In the evening she said to the Duke, âI am going, after dinner tomorrow,
to see the English at Meun. Have the men ready to march.â She easily
made Meun surrender, and then her guns fired at the town of Beaugency.

Then news came to Joan that the whole English army, under Talbot and Sir
John Fastolf (who cannot be Sir John Falstaff in Shakespeare, for the
fat knight was dead), were marching against her. Now Sir John Fastolf,
though a very brave captain, thought, like the fat knight, that
âdiscretion was the better part of valour.â He wished to be cautious,
and to avoid a battle, for he saw that the French were in high spirits,
while the English soldiers had lost heart. This is told in the book
written by a knight named Jean de Wavrin, a Burgundian. He was, like all
of them of Burgundy, on the English side, and he rode under the banner
of Sir John Fastolf.

I tell you generally how we come to know the things done by the Maid,
to show that the story is true, as the people who described it were
present, and saw what happened.

The other English captains thought Sir John rather too cautious, and
Talbot said. âBy St George. I will fight if I have only my own few men
with me!â Next morning the English rode out with banners flying, and
again Sir John said that they were too few, and that they were risking
all that Henry V. had gained in France. But Talbot and the rest would
not listen to him, so the trumpets blew, and the horsemen rode on
towards Meun, which Joan had taken. When they came to a place about
three miles from Meun, and three from Beaugency, they saw the banner of
the Maid, with Our Lord and the Lilies of France, and the banners of
the Duke of AlenÃ§on, and Dunois, and La Hire, and young Pothon de
Xaintrailles, a very gallant boy, waving over the ranks of 6000 men.

The English then did what Henry V. had taught them to do. They
dismounted from their horses to fight on foot, and made each bowman
plant his sharp stake in front of him, to stop a cavalry charge. This
plan usually succeeded. The French were fond of charging with their
cavalry at full speed, and then were usually shot down in heaps by the
English bowmen, whom they could not reach, as they were safe behind
their fence of pikes. Then the dismounted English would rush out, sword
in hard, among the disordered French cavalry.

You see this was much like part of the battle of Waterloo, when the
French cavalry many times rode at the English squares, and could not
break through the bayonets, while the English were shooting at them not
very straight!

By this plan of fighting the English had often defeated the French, and
usually defeated the Scots, who generally made a wild rush at them.
At the battle of Dupplin, soon after Robert Bruce died, the English
archers shot from each flank till the Scots, as they charged, fell dead
in heaps as high as a tall spear. But Dunois, and the fair Duke, and the
Maid knew this plan. They sent a herald to bid the English go home to
bed; it was late; âtomorrow we shall have a nearer view of each other.â

The English, therefore, went off to Meun, where nobody resisted them
except the French soldiers who guarded the bridge over the Loire. The
English meant to beat the French from the bridge with their cannons,
cross the river, and march to help their friends in Beaugency, which had
not yet yielded to Joan. The English would thus take Joanâs army between
two fires, that of Beaugency, and that of Talbotâs army.

But that very night the English in Beaugency lost heart, and yielded to
the Maid, being allowed to march away with their arms and horses. Jean
now bade the French captains go with her army, and look for Talbotâs
and Fastolfs force, who would hear of the surrender of Beaugency, and
retreat to Paris through the country called La Beauce.

âBut how are we to find the English?â the French leaders asked Joan: for
they would be in a wild, empty country covered with forests.

âRide forth,â she said; âwe shall take them all. As to finding them,
_you shall have a good guide!_â

They had a strange guide, as you shall hear.

The English were marching along, in front was their advanced guard,
under a knight who carried a white banner. Next came the guns, with the
waggons full of provisions. Third was the main body of the army, under
Talbot and Fastolf; and last rode the rear-guard. When they were near a
place called Pathay, their scouts galloped in, with news that they had
seen the French army. The English halted, and sent out more scouts, who
rode back with the same news.

So Talbot sent his advanced guard, the guns, and the waggons behind some
tall hedges. The main body of the English army was being placed at the
end of a long lane between two thick hedges, and Talbot set five hundred
of his best archers to lurk behind these hedges, between which the
French would have to pass before they could attack the centre of his
forces. If the French once entered this long lane, they would be shot
down, and fall into such confusion among their own fallen men and
wounded horses, that they would neither be able to go forward nor back,
and would all be killed or taken prisoners.

The French of Joanâs army could not see what Talbot was doing, and the
trap he had set, nor where his army was, the country being covered with
wood and bracken, and the English being concealed by the swelling of the
ground. However, they rode forward fast, and would bare been between the
fire of the two hidden lines of English bowmen in a minute, when, lo
and behold! they had âthe good guideâ that Joan had promised them!
As they rode they roused a stag from the bracken where he was lying:
the stag rushed forward into the concealed lines of English archers,
and they, being hunters like Robin Hoodâs men, forgot to lie still, and
raised a view halloo, and shot at the stag. Then the foremost riders of
the French heard them, and knew where the English were lying in ambush.
When Talbot saw that his ambush was found out, he hurried the main body
of hie army up to the hedges. Sir John Fastolfâs men were spurring their
horses on to join their advanced guard, but the English knight of the
white banner who led thought that Fastolfâs cavalry were French, and that
the French were attacking: his men both in front and rear, So he and
his company ran away leaving: the lane unguarded. Thus, when the battle
began, Talbot was defeated by Joanâs cavalry, and taken prisoner, and
2200 of the English were killed or taken before Fastolf came up. He and
his horsemen then rode away as fast as they could, to save their lives,
and for this behaviour Sir John got into very deep disgrace, though,
according to Wavrin, who was with him, he really could have done nothing
else, as Talbot was beaten before he could arrive. As Wavrin had taken
part in the flight, he had to make as good a defence of Sir John as he
could. At all events, Joan and her party won a very great victory, the
battle of Pathay.

Now look what Joan had done. She drove the English from Orleans on 8th
May. Then the Dauphin took to holding long and weary councils, and she
did not get another chance to fight the English till about 4th June, so
nearly a month of her one year of time was wasted. On 11th June she took
Jargeau, on 15th June she took Meun, on 17th June she took Beaugency,
and on 18th June she destroyed Talbotâs chief army at Pathay!

The Duke of Alencon tells us that he himself heard Joan tell the
Dauphin, again and again, that âshe would only last for a year, or not
much longer, and that he must make haste.â She had four things to do,
she said: to drive the English in flight, to crown the King at Rheims,
to deliver Orleans, and to set free the Duke of Orleans, who was a
prisoner in England.

She did drive the English in flight, she did save Orleans, she did have
the Dauphin crowned. But the French would not make haste. The Dauphin
was always slow, and the stupid political advisers who never fought but
only talked, made him more slow, and, when Joanâs year was over, for her
prophecy was true, she was taken prisoner by the English. Therefore
they were not driven quite out of France till about twenty years or more
after the end of the year of Joan the Maid. It was not her fault. She
knew that her time was short, and she told them to make haste. When she
was asked how she knew things that were to happen, she said that her
Voices told her, âmy Council,â she called them. But there was a French
noble, La TremoÃ¯lle, the Kingâs favourite, and he was jealous of Jean
and Dunois and the Constable of Brittany, an enemy of his, who had now
come to ride under Joanâs flag.

This Tremoille, and others, did not want to fight, and hoped to make
friends with the Duke of Burgundy, whose array, though really French,
fought on the side of the English. Now the one chance was to keep
hitting the English hard and often, while they were shaken by their
defeats, and before they had time to bring a new host from home. In
England there was an army ready, which had been collected by Cardinal
Beaufort, to fight the Hussites, a kind of warlike Protestants who were
active in Germany. As soon as Joan had beaten the English at Orleans,
they made up their minds to send this new army of theirs to protect
Paris, where most of the people, and the University, were on the English
side. They also made an arrangement with James I. of Scotland, so that
they had nothing to fear from the Scots coming over the Border to attack
them. The English were able to do all this because La TremoÃ¯lle and his
friends advised the Dauphin to loiter about, instead of making haste, as
Joan desired, to keep on beating the English.




CHAPTER X. HOW JOAN LED THE DAUPHIN TO BE CROWNED

|We may think that Joanâs best plan would have been to attack the
English in Paris at once, while they were still in a fright, after their
great defeat at Pathay. But she thought that if the Dauphin was once
crowned, and anointed with the holy oil, at Rheims, the French who were
of the English party would join him more readily. Robert the Bruce, in
the same way, had himself crowned at Scone, which, in Scotland, was the
usual place for coronations, when he had only very few followers, and
very little chance of beating the English. Rheims, as you can sec on the
map, is a long way farther from Orleans than Paris, on the north-east.

But Joan had made up her mind to drag the Dauphin to Rheims to be
crowned.

The Dauphin was lingering at Gien, which is some distance south of
Orleans, instead of being at the head of his army, and in the front
of the fighting, where he should have been. His lazy and cowardly
favourites told him that it was a long way to Rheims, and on the
road there were several towns with strong walls, and castles full of
Englishmen and Burgundians, who would not let him pass.

Joan answered that she knew this very well, and cared nothing about it:
all the towns and castles would yield and open their gates. So she left
the Dauphin to do as he pleased, and went away with her company into
the country. The Dauphin had no money to pay his troops, but men-at-arms
came in, hundreds of them, saying that they would fight for the love
of the Maid and of chivalry. No doubt they would have been very glad to
crown _her_, in place of the stupid Dauphin, but the French law did not
allow it; and Joan wanted nothing for herself, only to make France free,
and go back to her mother, as she said. However, the Dauphin, who was
grateful in his lazy way, made her and her brothers, Peter and John,
nobles, and gave her a coat-of-arms, a sword supporting the Crown, with
the Lilies of France on each side, and changed their name to du Lys.
But Joan never used her coat-of-arms, but bore a Dove, silver, on a blue
shield. Her brothers were with her, and seem to have fought very well,
though in most ways they were quite ordinary young men.

When Joan went away, the Dauphin made up his mind at last to march
to Rheims, going first to Troyes, a strong town on the road. All the
castles and fortresses on the way, instead of resisting him, submitted
to him, as Joan had said that they would. At Troyes, where he came on
8th July, the English garrison, and the people of the town who were on
the English and Burgundian side, wanted to oppose him. They fought on
the 8th and 9th of Jury. The Dauphinâs advisers did not want to fight,
the brave Dunois tells us, but Jean said, âGentle Dauphin, bid your army
besiege the town, and do net hold these long councils, for in three days
I will bring you into the town.â Then down she went to the great ditch
or fosse round the town, and worked harder, says Dunois, than two or
three of the most famous knights could have done. The people of Troyes
then yielded to Joan, and they had a great feast in the city, which they
needed, for the army had been living on soup made from the beans in the
fields.

Then they went on to Rheims, and the Archbishop and all the people came
out to meet them, with shouts of joy. On 17th July the Dauphin, with
Joan and all his nobles, went to the Cathedral, and there he was crowned
and anointed, and made King in earnest, Joan standing beside him with
her banner in her hand. This was her happiest day, perhaps, and the last
of her great days. She had done so much! In the beginning of May there
was every chance that the English would take Orleans, and sweep across
the Loire, and seize all France, and drive the Dauphin into Spain, or
across the sea to Scotland, and France would have been under the English
for who knows how long. But in two months Joan had driven the English
behind the walls of Paris, and her Dauphin was King in deed.

Then the Maid knelt at the Kingâs feet and wept for joy, in the
great Cathedral, among the splendid nobles, and the lights, and the
bright-coloured coats-of-arms, and the sweet smoke of incense.

âGentle King,â she said, calling him âKingâ for the first time, ânow is
the will of God fulfilled!â and the knights themselves wept for joy.

Somewhere in the crowd was an elderly countryman in his best clothes.
Joanâs father, whom now she saw for the first time since she left her
village, and for the last time in her life. The King asked her to
choose a gift and reward, and she asked that the people of her village,
Domremy, should be free from paying taxes, and they were made free, and
never paid taxes again, for three hundred years. On the books of the
accounts of money paid by every town and village of France is written,
after the names of Domremy and the village nearest it, Greux, _Nothing.
For the Sake of the Maid._

The paper in which the King ordered that they should pay nothing may
still be seen, dated the last of July 1429.

How glad the people at Domremy must have been when Joanâs father came
home with the good news!

This was the last glad day of the Maid.

As she rode to Rheims, some people from Domremy met her and asked her if
she was afraid of nothing.

âOf nothing but treachery,â she said, and, from this day, she met
treachery among the Kingâs advisers, who held long councils, and did not
fight.

As she rode from Rheims towards Paris, the people shouted round her, and
she said that they were kind people, and she would like to be buried in
their cathedral--she, who was never to be buried in the earth.

âJoan,â said the Archbishop, âin what place do you expect to die?â

âWhere God pleases, for of that hour and that place I know nothing more
than you do. But would to God that now I might take off my armour, and
go home to my father and mother,â for, as she had seen her father, she
was longing for her mother more than ever.

After this, the people about the King-, and the King himself, did not
obey Joan, and all went wrong.




CHAPTER XI. HOW THE MAID WAS BETRAYED AT PARIS

|THE French should have followed the Maid straight to Paris, as she bade
them do. But they went here and went there, and one day their army and
that of the Duke of Bedford met, but did not fight; and another day
there were skirmishes between the English and the Scots, âwho fought
very bravely,â says the Burgundian knight, Enguerrand de Manstrelet, who
wrote a history of those times. The strong town of CompiÃ¨gne, which
had often been taken and retaken, yielded to Joanâs army, and the King
stayed there, doing nothing, which was what he liked, and the Duke of
Burgundy gave him excuses for loitering by sending ambassadors, and
pretending that he would give up Paris, for at this time there was no
English garrison there. The poor people of the town were on the side of
Joan and the King, and now, when the English were out of the great city,
was the time to take it. But the King kept hoping to make peace with the
Duke of Burgundy, so Joan, with her friend the Duke of AlenÃ§on, went to
Saint Denis, quite close to Paris, where the Kings of France used to
be buried: Saint Denis was the Saint of France, as Saint George was the
Saint of England, and Saint Andrew of Scotland. There fought the Duke
and the Maid, but the King came on very slowly, while Joan was in the
front of battle every day, at one gate of Paris or another. At last, by
often going to him, and urging him to come, AlenÃ§on brought the King to
Saint Denis, but not before a strong new English army had arrived in the
town, of which the walls and towers were very high and thick, and the
fosses broad and deep, and full of water.

Then Joan led on her men and the Dukeâs, with her banner in her hand,
and cried them on to break down a gate called the Porte St. HonorÃ©.

Percival de Cagny, who rode under the standard of AlenÃ§on, was in
the battle, and he says, âThe fight was long: and fierce, and it was
wonderful to hear the noise of guns and culverins from the walls, and to
see the arrows fly like clouds. Few of those who went down into the
dry ditch with the Maid were hurt, though many others were wounded
with arrows and stone cannon balls, but, by Godâs grace and the Maidâs
favour, there were none but could return without help. We fought from
noon till darkness began. After the sun set, the Maid was wounded by a
bolt from a cross-how in the thigh, but she only shouted louder to âcome
on and the place was ours.â But when it was dark and all were weary,
men came from the King and brought her up out of the ditch against her
will.â

[Illustration: 0093]

Next day the Maid rose early, and went to the Duke of AlenÃ§on, who
never failed her. The trumpets blew, and a new ally came, the Baron de
Montmorency, with sixty gentlemen and their men-at-arms, and they were
riding to attack Paris again when the King sent messengers to forbid
them to do as their hearts desired. So they had to go to see him at
Saint Denis. But the Duke of Alencon was having a bridge of wood thrown
across the river Seine, at a new place, and they meant to cross by that
bridge next day, and attack Paris again.

Shameful to say, the King had that bridge taken to pieces during the
night, and when Joan and the Duke led their men there next day, they
found only the river, which they could not ford. So the King of France
saved Paris from dâAlenÃ§on and the Maid.

Richard I. of England would have battered down the Paris gate with his
own battle-axe; Henry V. or James IV. of Scotland, or Prince Charlie,
would have been, foremost in the fight; but this King of France, Charies
VII., unworthy of his country and his ancestors, sneaked off to his
pretty little town of Gien, on the Loire.

âAnd thus was the will of the Maid broken, and the army of the King,â
 says Percival de Cagny.

The Duke of Alencon kept his men together, and told the King that, if
he would let the Maid ride with him, they would march into Normandy,
and attack the English where they were strongest. But the King would not
hear of it, and the Maid, with almost a broken heart, hung up her armour
at the altar of Saint Denis, in his Cathedral. Half of her year was
spent, and the King made her stay with him in the towns on the Loire,
when he might have been in Paris, his capital, if he had only trusted
Joan.

In the meantime the English retook some of the French towns that Joan
had given to the King, and seized her sacred armour in the Church of
Saint Denis, and punished and plundered the people, who were worse off
than before, while the Maid was only allowed now and then to attack the
English, and defeat them in the old way.




CHAPTER XII. HOW THE MAID TOOK CERTAIN TOWNS

|THE wise King had arranged with the Duke of Burgundy that they two
should be at peace till Easter, 1430; while he might fight the English
as much as he liked, which was, not at all.

Now the English let the Duke of Burgundy be Governor of Paris. It was
always Paris that the Maid wished to take for her King, as it was the
greatest city and the capital of France. But the King said she must not
attack Paris, for it was now under the Duke of Burgundy, not under the
English. All this was mere pretence, to avoid fighting. Jeanâs aim was
to turn the English and their child King, Henry VI., out of her country;
and the English were not likely to go out till they were driven out.

The English still held towns on the river Loire, such as St.
Pierre-le-Moustier and La CharitÃ©. Joan went to Bourges and gathered
an army, with a gentleman named dâElbret to help her, and besieged the
town of St. Pierre-le-Moustier. When they had battered the walls for
some time with their guns, and made a breach, the French tried to rash
through it; but the English were too strong and too many, and drove them
out At this time Joanâs Master cf the Household, dâAulon, who had been
with her at Orleans, was wounded in the heel by an arrow, and he could
not walk without crutches. He saw that while the rest of the French had
retired out of shot from the breach, Joan was there almost alone, with
a very small company. DâAulon therefore got a horse, and rode to her to
ask her to come out of danger. âWhat are you doing here alone?â he asked
her. She took off her helmet and said, âI am not alone; here I have
with me fifty thousand of my ownâ (by which she seems to have meant an
invisible army of Angels); âand will not leave this place till I take
the town.â DâAulon told her that she had but four or five men with her,
to which she only answered by bidding him make her army bring faggots of
wood to fill up the ditch with, that they might cross to the town. Then
she shouted in a loud voice:--

âBring up faggots, all of you!â and they obeyed, filled up the ditch,
attacked the breach in the wall again, rushed through, beat the English,
and took the town.

This was just like what Joan had done when her army was on the point cf
retreating from the attack on Les Tourelles, at Orleans. âOne charge
moreâ was what she called for, and her men were inspired with courage,
while the English were terrified by their refusal to be beaten. This was
the last time that Joan led the French to such a victory. She besieged
another town, La CharitÃ©, which was held by Burgundians, but the
King did mot send food enough for her men, and she had to go away
unsuccessful.

About this time she was troubled by a woman called Catherine of La
Rochelle, a married woman, who declared that a lovely lady came to her
at night, dressed all in doth of gold, and told her where treasures of
money were hidden, which were much needed for the wars. Jean said that
she must see this wonderful lady before she could believe in her, and
she sat up all night with Catherine; but the lady never came. Joan told
Catherine to go back to her husband and her children, and mind her own
affairs. There were several people who went about saying that they had
visions; but they were of no use, for, visions or none, they had not
Joanâs courage and wisdom. It is true that Catherine might have said to
Joan, âYou canât see my golden lady, but I canât see your Saints, nor
hear your Voices.â The difference was that Joanâs Saints and Voices
had enabled her to do a great many wonderful things, while Catherineâs
golden lady never led to the finding of treasures or anything else that
was of any use.




CHAPTER XIII. HOW THE VOICES PROPHESIED EVIL

|THE end of the year of the Maid was at hand. She had often said that
she would last but a year, or little more, counting from May 1429.

Perhaps you remember that the King had made a truce with the
Burgundians--an useless truce, for the Burgundians went on fighting, not
under their own flag, but under the Leopards of England. The King, as
usual, was loitering about, doing nothing. Joan heard, in spring 1430,
that three or four hundred English were crossing the Isle of France,
which is not a real island, but a district of that name. She was then
at Lagny, on the river Marne, not far from Paris. So she rode out from
Lagny to meet them, with a gentleman whom the French called âQuenede.â
 Can you guess what âQuenedeâ means? He was Sir Hugh Kennedy, of the
great Kennedy clan in Callaway and Ayrshire. He had fought at the Battle
of the Herrings and at Orleans, and he made a good deal of money in
France, so that, when he went back to Scotland, he was called âHugh come
wiâ the Penny.â

When Joan, with her French and Scots, came in sight of the enemy, the
English drew themselves up on foot, along the side of a hedge, and Joan
and the rest charged them, some on foot, some on horse, and there was
hard fighting, for the numbers were about equal But at last all the
English were kilâed or taken prisoners. There was also taken a robber
knight, Franquet dâArras, who was tried for his crimes and put to death,
and the English party among the French thought it very wicked in Jean to
allow the rogue to be punished.

In Easter Week Joan was at Melun one day, examining the ditch round the
walls to see that it was in good order. Then suddenly the Voices of St.
Catherine and St. Margaret spoke to her, and said that she should be
taken prisoner before Midsummer day, âand thus it needs must be,â and
that she was to be resigned to this, and God would help her.

Often after this terrible day the Voices made the same prophecy, but
they would never tell her the time and the hour. She prayed that she
might die in that hour, for the English had often threatened her that
they would burn her as a witch, if they caught her. Often she asked the
Voices to warn her of the hour of her capture, for she would not have
gone into battle on that day. But they would not tell her, and, after
that, she did what the Captains of her party thought best, and it seems
that, as to where or when she was to fight, she had no advice from the
Voices. But she fought on as bravely as ever, and this was the bravest
thing that ever was done by any one. For it was not as if the Voices had
said that she should be killed in battle, of which she had no fear. But
they said she was to be captured, and she knew that meant she was to be
burned alive.

Nobody but Joan would have gone on risking herself every day, not to
danger of war, which is the duty of every soldier, but to the death by
fire. If any one says that the Voices were only her fancy, and her fear
taking a fanciful shape, we must reply that, whatever they really were,
she believed all that they said, and thought that they were the voices
of her sisters, the Saints. Thus the end of Joan was the most glorious
thing in her glorious life, for many could be brave enough when the
Saints prophesied victory, but only she could give her body to be burned
for her country.




CHAPTER XIV. HOW THE MAID WAS TAKEN

|WE have heard how the town of CompiÃ¨gne came over to Joan and the
King, after the coronation at Rheims. The city had often been taken and
retaken, and hold by both sides. But now they made up their minds that,
come what might, they would be true to France, and now, in May, the
English and Burgundians besieged CompiÃ¨gne with a very large army.

Joan, who was at Lagny, heard of this, and she made up her mind to help
the good and loyal town, or perish with it. She first tried to cut the
roads that the Duke of Burgundy used for his soldiers and supplies of
food, but she failed to take Soissons and Pent lâÃvÃªque, and so shut the
Duke off from his bridges over the rivers. So she rode into CompiÃ¨gne
under cloud of night, with her brother Pierre, and two or three hundred
men. This was before dawn, on May 23.

The town of CompiÃ¨gne is on the left bank of the river Oise. Behind the
town was a forest, through which Joan rode, and got into the town, to
the great joy of the people. From CompiÃ¨gne to the right bank of the
Oise, where the English and Burgundians had their camps, there was a
long bridge, fortified, that led into a great level meadow, about a mile
broad. In wet weather the meadow was often under water from the flooded
river, so a causeway, or raised road, was built across it, high and dry.
At the end of the causeway, farthest from CompiÃ¨gne was the village
of Margny, with the steeple of its church, and here a part of the
Burgundian army was encamped. Two miles and a half farther on was the
village of Clairoix, where lay another part of the Burgundian force.
About a mile and a half to the left of the causeway was the village of
Venette, which was held by the English, and, about three miles off, was
Coudun, where the Duke of Burgundy himself had his quarters. There were
very large forces in front, and on the side, of the only road by which
Joan could get at them, with her own men, only three hundred, probably,
and any of the townspeople who liked to follow her on foot, with clubs
and scythes, and such weapons.

Thus it was really a very rash thing of Joan to lead so few men, by such
a narrow road, to attack the nearest Burgundians, those at Margny, at
the end of the causeway. The other Burgundians, farther off, and the
English from Venette, quite near, and on Joanâs left flank, would
certainly come up to attack her, and help their friends at Margny.
She would be surrounded on all sides and cut off, for the garrison of
CompiÃ¨gne stayed in the town, under their general, de Flavy, who was a
great ruffian, but a brave man, and loyal to France.

Why Joan, about five oâclock in the evening of May 23. rode out with her
little force, crossed the bridge, galloped down the causeway, and rode
through and through the Burgundians at Margny, we do not know. Her
Voices seem to have ceased to give her advice, only saying that she
would certainly be captured. Perhaps she only meant to take Margny;
though it is not easy to understand how she expected to hold it, when
the whole Burgundian and English armies came up to recover it, as they
would certainly do. If she aimed at more, her charge was very brave but
very ill-judged. Joan said that her Voices did not tell her to make her
desperate sally; it was her own idea.

Nearly seventy years afterwards, two very old men said that, when they
were young at CompiÃ¨gne, they heard Joan tell a crowd of children,
before she rode out, that âI am betrayed, and soon will be delivered to
death. Pray God for me, for I shall never again be able to help France
and the King.â One of the men was ninety-eight, so he would be quite
twenty-eight when he heard Joan say this; if he really did hear her But,
long before men are ninety-eight, or even eighty-six, line the other
man, they are apt to remember things that never happened. But Joan may
have told children, of whom she was very fond, that she knew she was
soon to be taken.

Her enemies declared that she said she would take the Duke of Burgundy
himself, but as he was several miles away, in the middle of a large
army, while she had only three hundred of her own men, this cannot be
true. Probably she only meant to break up the Burgundians at Margny, and
show that she was there, to encourage the people at CompiÃ¨gne.

Her own account is that she charged the Burgundians at Margny, the
nearest village, and drove them twice back to Clairoix, where they were
reinforced by the great Burgundian army there, and thrust her back to
the middle of the causeway, where she turned again, charged them, and
made them retreat. But then the English came up from Venette, on her
flank, and came between her and the bridge of CompiÃ¨gne, and she
leaped her horse off the raised causeway into the meadow, where she was
surrounded, and pulled off her horse and taken, though she would not
surrender. No doubt she hoped that, as she refused to surrender, she
would be killed on the spot. When they cried to her to yield she said,
âI have given my faith to another than you, and I will keep my oath to
Him,â meaning Our Lord.

[Illustration: 0111]

But she was too valuable to be killed. The captors might either get a
great ransom, a kingâs ransom, or sell her to the English to burn.
The French would not pay the ransom, and Jean de Luxembourg, who got
possession of her, sold her to the English. The Burgundian historian,
who was with the Duke, and did not see the battle, says, âthe English
feared not any captain, nor any chief in war, as they feared the Maid.â

âShe had done great deeds, passing the nature of woman.â Says another
Burgundian writer: âShe remained in the rear of her men as their
captain, and the bravest of all, there, where fortune granted it, for
the end of her glory, and for that last time of her bearing arms.â

But, indeed, her glory never ceased, for in her long, cruel imprisonment
and martyrdom, she showed mere courage than any man-at-arms can display,
where blows are given and taken.




CHAPTER XV. THE CAPTIVITY OF THE MAID

|WE might suppose that there was not a rich man in France, or even a
poor man, who would not have given what he could, much or little, to
help to pay the ransom of the Maid. Jean de Luxembourg only wanted
the money, and, as she was a prisoner of war, she might expect to be
ransomed like other prisoners. It was the more needful to get the money
and buy her freedom, as the priests of the University of Paris, who were
on the English side, at once wrote to Jean de Luxembourg (July 14), and
asked him to give Joan up to the Inquisition, to be tried by the laws
of the Inquisition for the crimes of witchcraft, idolatry, and wrong
doctrines about religion.

The Inquisitor was the head of a kind of religious Court, which tried
people for not holding the right belief, or for witchcraft, or other
religious offences. The rules of the Court, and the way of managing the
trials, were what we think very unfair. But they were not more unfair
than the methods used in Scotland after the Reformation. With us old
women were tortured till they confessed that they were witches, and then
were burned alive, sometimes seven or eight of them at once, for crimes
which nobody could possibly commit.

That went on in Scotland till the country was united to England, at the
beginning of the eighteenth century, and the laws against witchcraft
were not abolished till 1736. Many of the Presbyterian ministers,
who were active in hunting for witches and having them put to horrid
tortures, were very angry that the witchcraft laws were abolished. The
Inquisition was better than the ministers and magistrates in one way: if
a witch confessed, and promised not to do it again, she was not put to
death, but kept in prison. In Scotland the people accused of witchcraft
had not even this chance, which did not help Joan, as we shall see.

All this is told here, to show that the French were not more stupid
and cruel four hundred years ago, than we were in Scotland, two hundred
years ago. But it was a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
Inquisition, and therefore the French King and his subjects should have
paid Joanâs ransom at once or rescued her by force of arms. But not a
coin was paid, and not a sword was drawn to ransom or to rescue her. The
people who advised the King had never liked her, and now the King left
her to her fate. She could have taken a bitter revenge on him, if she
had chosen to tell tales; but she was loyal to the last, like Montrose
to Charles II.

Of course Joan was not a witch, and was a most religious girl, but
she did not deny that she had talked with spirits, the spirits of the
Saints; and her judges, who hated her, could say, and did say, that
these spirits were devils, in disguise, and that therefore she was a
witch. She always had known that they would do this, if they got the
chance.

Jean de Luxembourg did not hand Joan over to the priests at once:
probably he was waiting to see if he could not get a better price from
her French friends than from her English enemies. The Bishop of Beauvais
was Joanâs worst enemy: his odious name was Pierre Cauchon, and in July
he kept pressing the Duke of Burgundy, then still besieging CompiÃ¨gne,
to make Jean give up the Maid. Jean kept the Maid in a castle called
Beaulieu till August, and then sent her to another castle, Beaurevoir,
near Cambrai, far to the north, where it would be more difficult for her
friends like Dunois and dâAlencon to come and rescue her by force, which
we do not hear that they ever tried to do, though perhaps they did. The
brave Xaintrailles was doing a thing that Joan longed for even more
than for her freedom. She was taken in fighting to help the town of
CompiÃ¨gne, of which she was very fond, and her great grief at Beaulieu
and Beaurevoir was that CompiÃ¨gne was likely to be taken by the
Burgundians and English, who threatened to put the people to death. All
this while Xaintrailles was preparing a small army to deliver CompiÃ¨gne.

At Beaurevoir the ladies of the castle were kinsfolk of Jean de
Luxembourg. They were good women, and very kind to Joan, and they knelt
to Jean, weeping, and asking him to give her back to her friends. But
he wanted his money, like the men who sold Sir William Wallace to the
English, and the great Montrose to the preachers and Parliament.

So Jean sold the Maid to the English. Joan knew this, and knew what she
had to expect. She was allowed to take the air on the flat roof of the
great tower at Leaurevoir, which was 60 feet high. She was not thinking
so much of herself as of CompiÃ¨gne. If she could escape she would try
to make her way to CompiÃ¨gne, and help the people to fight for their
liberty and their lives. But how could she escape? She hoped that, if
she leaped from the top of the tower, her Saints would bear her up in
their arms, and not let her be hurt by the fall. So she asked them if
she might leap down, but St. Catherine said, No; she must not leap. God
would help her and the people of CompiÃ¨gne.

But Jean would not listen, this time, to the Voice. She said that, if
the leap was wrong, she would rather trust her soul to the mercy of God,
than her body to the English. And she _must_ go to CompiÃ¨gne, for she
heard that, when the town was taken, all the people, old and young, were
to be put to the sword.

[Illustration: 0119]

Then she leaped, and there she lay. She was not hurt, not a bone of her
was broken, which is an extraordinary thing, but she could not move
a limb. The people of the castle came and took her back to her prison
room. She did not know what had happened, and for three days she ate
nothing. Then her memory came back to her and to her sorrows. Why was
she not allowed to die! St. Catherine told her that she had sinned, and
must confess, and ask the Divine mercy. But she was to go through with
her appointed task. âTake no care for thy torment,â said the Voice;
âthence shalt thou come into Paradise.â Moreover, St. Catherine
promised that CompiÃ¨gne should be rescued before Martinmas. That was the
last good news, and the last happy thing that came to Joan in the
days of her life; for, just before Martinmas, her friend, Pothon
de Xaintrailles, rode with his men-at-arms through the forest of
CompiÃ¨gne, whilst others of the French attacked the English and
Burgundians on the farther side of the Oise, and so the Saint kept her
promise, and CompiÃ¨gne was saved.




CHAPTER XVI. THE TRIAL OF THE MAID

|AS Joan was a woman, and a prisoner of the Church, when the English had
handed her over to the priests, she ought to have been kept in gentle
prison, and with only women about her. But the English were very cruel.
They had a kind of cage made, called a _huche_, and put in a strong room
in the Castle of Rouen. In this cage they kept Joan, with chains on.
her legs, which were fastened to a strong post or beam of the bed. Five
common soldiers kept watch in the room, day and night; the eyes of men
were always on the most modest of girls. We see how much they feared
her. They wished to have her proved a witch, and one who dealt with
devils, to take away the shame of having been defeated by a girl, and
also to disgrace the French King by making the world believe that he had
been helped by a sorceress and her evil spirits. In truth, if you read
_Henry VI_., Part L, by Shakespeare, you will see just what the English
thought about the Maid. Shakespeare, of course, did not know the true
story of Joan, and he makes her say abominable things, which not even
her enemies brought up against her at her Trial. If Shakespeare wrote
the play, he did not care a penny for the truth of the story. He sends
Joan to Bordeaux, where she never was in her life, and makes âFiendsâ
 (that is, her Saints) appear to her, and show that they will help her
no longer. So she offers her very soul as a sacrifice for the sake of
France:

               âThen take my soul, my body, soul and all,

               Before that England give the French the foil.â

Later she turns on the English, and says what she might have said with
truth:

               âI never had to do with wicked spirits:

               But you, that are polluted with your lusts,

               Stained with the guiltless blood of innocents,

               Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,

               Because you want the grace that others have,

               You judge it straight a thing impossible

               To compass wonders but by help of devils.â

The English had devils on their own side, the cruel priests and Bishop
Cauchon, whom they had promised to make Archbishop of Rouen. But he
never got it.

For three months these people examined Joan every day, sometimes all
shouting at her at once, so that she said, âGentlemen, if you please,
one at a time.â She had no advocate, who knew the law, to help her to
defend herself. But once, when she appealed to the Council of Basle, a
Council cf the Church which was then sitting, they bade her be silent,
and told the clerk who took down everything in writing, in French, not
to write down her appeal. There is nothing about this in the Latin book
of the Trial, translated from the French, but in the French copy, mode
in court, you see the place where the clerkâs pen has stepped at the
words, âand she appealsâ (_Et requiert_, in French). He was going to
write the rest. Now she had a right to appeal, and as the clergy at the
Council of Basle were of many countries, they would not have taken the
English side, but pronounced Joan innocent. The Bishops and clergy of
the loyal French party at Poitiers, before she went to the war, had
declared her innocent and a thing of God, after a long examination of
her life up till April 1429. Joan often asked her judges to send for
âthe Poitiers book,â where they would find answers to their questions
about her early days; but they vexed her about everything, even about
the fairy tree, on which the children used to hang their garlands. Their
notion seems to have been that the fairies were her helpers, not the
Saints, and that the fairies were evil spirits.

Joan had shown that, in war and politics, she was wiser than the
soldiers and statesmen. She went straight at the work to be done--to
beat the English, and to keep attacking them before they got back their
confidence. At her Trial she showed that she was far wiser than the
learned priests. They tried to prove that she was helped by fairies. She
said that she did not believe there were any fairies: and though I would
not say that there are _none_, there certainly are not so many, or so
busy and powerful, as the priests supposed. They kept asking her about
the prophecies of Merlin the Wizard: she thought nothing of Merlin the
Wizard.

She vowed to speak truth in answer to questions, but she would not
answer questions about her Saints and Voices, except when they gave her
permission. The judges troubled her most about the secret of the King,
and what she told him about that, before she went to the wars. You
remember that the King had secretly prayed to know whether he really was
the son of the late King or not, and that Joan told him of his prayer,
and told him that he was the son of the late King, and had the right to
be King himself. But she would tell the Judges nothing about all this
matter. If she had, the English would have cried everywhere, âYou see he
is not certain himself that he is what he pretends to be. _Our_ King of
England is the only King of France.â

[Illustration: 0127]

Joan would not betray her Kingâs doubts. She never would tell what
happened. At last she cold a simple parable: an Angel came with a rich
crown for the King. But, later, she explained that by the Angel she
meant herself, and that by the Crown, she meant her having him crowned
at Rheims. They never could get the Kingâs secret out of her. At last
they said they would put her to the torture. They took her to a horrible
vault, full of abominable instruments for pinching, and tearing, and
roasting, and screwing the bodies of men. There stood the executioner,
with his arms bare, and his fire lit, and all his pincers, and ropes,
and pulleys ready.

âNow will you tell us?â they said. Brave men had turned faint with
terror in that vault, and had said anything that they were asked to
say, rather than face the pain. There was a Marshal of France, Gilles de
Rais, a nobleman who fought beside Joan at Orleans, at Les Tourelles,
at Jargeau, at Pathay, and at Paris, and who carried the sacred
vessel which the Angel brought, long ago, with holy oil, at the Kingâs
coronation. Later this man was accused by the Inquisition of the most
horrible crimes. Among other things, he was said to have sacrificed
children to the devil, and to have killed hundreds of little boys for
his own amusement. But hundreds of little boys were not proved to be
missing, and none of their remains were ever found. Gilles de Rais
denied these horrible charges; he said he was innocent, and, for all
that we know, he was. But they took him to the torture vault, and showed
him the engines of torment, and he confessed everything, so that he
might be put to death without torture, which was done.

Joan did not fear and turn faint. She said, âTorture me if you please.
Tear my body to pieces. Whatever I say in my pains will not be true, and
as soon as I am released I will deny that it was true. Now, go on!â Many
priests wished to go on, but more, even of these cruel enemies, said,
âNo!â they would not torture the girl.

âWhat a brave lass. Pity she is not English!â one of the English lords
said, when he saw Joan standing up against the crowd of priests and
lawyers.

Remember that, for six weeks, during Lent, Joan took no food all day.
There she stood, starving, and answering everybody, always bravely,
always courteously, always wisely, and sometimes even merrily. They kept
asking her the same questions on different days, to try to make her vary
in her answers. All the answers were written down. Once they said she
had answered differently before, and, when the book was examined, it
proved that there was some mistake in the thing, and that Jean was in
the right. She was much pleased, and said to the clerk, âIf you make
mistakes again, I will pull your ears.â

They troubled her very much about wearing boyâs dress. She said that,
when among men in war, it was better and more proper. She was still
among men, with soldiers in her room, day and night, which was quite
unlawful; she should have had only women about her. She would not put on
womenâs dress while she was among men, and was quite in the right.

She could hear her Voices in Court, but not clearly on account of the
noise. Once, I suppose, she heard them, for she suddenly said, in the
middle of an answer to a question about the letters which were written
for her when she was in the wars:

âBefore seven years are passed the English will lose a greater stake
than they have lost at Orleans; they will lose everything in France.â

Before the seven years were out they lost Paris, a much greater stake
than Orleans, as Paris was the chief town and the largest They went on
losing till they lost everything in France, even all that they had held
for hundreds of years.

The Judges insisted that she should submit to the Church. Joan asked
nothing better. âTake me to the Pope, and I will answer him, for I know
and believe that we should obey our Holy Father, the Pope, who is in
Rome.â Or she would answer the Council of the whole Church at Basle,
but, as I said, the Bishop Cauchon stopped the clerk when he was writing
down the words. The Judges said â_We_ are the Church; answer us and obey
us.â But, of course, they were not the Church; they were only a set of
disloyal French priests who sided against their own country, and helped
the English.




CHAPTER XVII. HOW THE PRIESTS BETRAYED THE MAID

|AT last, on May 24, 1431, they determined to force her to acknowledge
herself in the wrong, and to deny her Saints. On that day they took
her to the graveyard of the Church of St. Ouen. Two platforms had been
built; on one stood the wretched Cauchon with his gang; Joan was placed
on the other. There was also a stake with faggots, for burning Joan.
They had ready two written papers: on one it was written that Joan
would submit to them, and wear womanâs dress. On the other was a long
statement that her Saints were evil spirits, and that she had done all
sorts of wrong things. She was told that if she would sign the short
paper, and wear womans dress, she would be put in gentle prison, with
women about her instead of English soldiers. Seeing the fire ready, Jean
repeated the _short_ form of words, and made her mark, smiling, on the
piece of paper that they gave her, but it was the paper with the long
speech, accusing herself of crimes and denying her Saints.

This is what we are told, but, later, she showed that she thought
she had denied her Saints, so it is not easy to be quite sure of what
happened. It is certain that Cauchon broke his word. She was not taken
away from her cruel prison and the English soldiers, as was promised.
She was given womanâs dress; but, as they were determined to make her
ârelapse,â that is, return to the sin of wearing manâs dress, for then
they could burn her, they put her boyâs dress in her room, and so acted
that she was obliged to put it on. It is a horrid story, not fit to be
told, of cruelty and falseness.

âNow we have her!â said Cauchon to an Englishman.

They went to her, and asked her if the Voices had come to her again?

âYes!â

âWhat did they say?â

âSt. Catherine and St. Margaret told me that I had done very wrong, when
I said what I did to save my life, and that I was damning myself to save
my life.â

âThen you believe that the Voices were the voices of the Saints.â

âYes, I believe that, and that the Voices come from God;â and she said
that she did not mean ever to have denied it.

On the day of her burning, the Bishop and the rest went to Joan again,
and wrote out a statement that she left it to the Church to say whether
her Voices were good or bad. The Church has decided that they were good,
and has given Joan the title of âVenerable,â which is the first step
toward proclaiming her to be one of the Saints. Whatever the Voices
were, she said they were _real_, not fancied things.

But this paper does not count, for the clerk who took all the notes
refused to go with the Bishop to see Joan, that time, saying that it was
no part of the law, and that they went as private men, not as Judges,
and he had the courage not to sign the paper. He was an honest man, and
thought Joan a good girl, unlawfully treated, and was very sorry for
her. âHe never wept so much for any sorrow in all his life, and for a
month he could not be quiet for sorrow: and he bought a book of prayers
and prayed for the soul of the Maid.â

This honest manâs name was Gilbert Manchon.




CHAPTER XVIII. THE END OF THE MAID

|THEY burned her cruelly to death in the market-place of Rouen, with
eight hundred soldiers round the stake, lest any should attempt to save
her. They had put a false accusation on a paper cap, and set it on
her head: it was written that she was âHeretic, Relapsed, Apostate,
Idolatress.â This was her reward for the bravest and best life that was
ever lived.

_She came to her own and her own received her not_.

There was with her a priest who pitied her, not one of her
Judges--Brother Isambert de la Pierre, of the order of St. Augustine.
Joan asked him to bring her a cross, and to hold it up before her eyes
while she was burning. âSaith moreover that while she was in the fire
she ceased never to call loudly on the Holy Name of Jesus; always, too,
imploring: ceaselessly the help of the Saints in Paradise; and more,
when the end was now come, she bowed her head, and gave up her spirit,
calling on the name of Jesus.â

The Saints had said to her, long before: âBear your torment lightly:
thence shall you come into the kingdom of Paradise.â

So died Joan the Maid.

It is said by some who were present, that even the English Cardinal,
Beaufort, wept when he saw the Maid die: âcrocodilesâ tears!â One of the
secretaries of Henry VI. (who himself was only a little boy) said, âWe
are all lost. We have burned a Saint!â

They were all lost. The curse of their cruelty did not depart from them.
Driven by the French and Scots from province to province, and from town
to town, the English returned home, tore and rent each other; murdering
their princes and nobles on the scaffold, and slaying them as prisoners
of war on the field; and stabbing and smothering them in chambers of the
Tower; York and Lancaster devouring each other; the man Henry VI.
was driven from home to wander by the waves at St. Andrews, before he
wandered back to England and the dagger stroke-these things were the
reward the English won, after they had burned a Saint, they ate the
bread and drank the cup of their own greed and cruelty all through the
Wars of the Roses. They brought shame upon their name which Time can
never wash away; they did the Devilâs work, and took the Devilâs wages.
Soon Henry VIII. was butchering his wives and burning Catholics and
Protestants, now one, now the other, as the humour seized him.

Joan had said to the Archbishop, at Rheims, that she knew not where she
would die, or where she would be buried. Her ashes were never laid in
the earth; she had no grave. The English, that men might forget her,
threw her ashes into the sea. There remains no relic of Joan of Arc; no
portrait, nothing she ever wore, no cup or sword or jewel that she ever
touched. But she is not forgotten; she never will be forgotten. On every
Eighth of May, the day when she turned the tide of English conquest, a
procession in her honour goes through the streets of Orleans, the
city that she saved; and though the Protestants, at the Reformation,
destroyed her statue that knelt before the Fair Cross on the bridge, she
has statues in many of the towns in France. She was driven from the gate
of Paris, but near the place where she lay wounded in the ditch, is her
statue, showing her on horseback, in armour.




CHAPTER XIX. THE SECOND TRIAL OF THE MAID

|THE rich and the strong had not paid a franc, or drawn a sword to
ransom or to rescue Joan. The poor had prayed for her, and the written
prayers which they used may still be seen. Probably the others would
have been glad to let Joanâs memory perish, but to do this was not
convenient. If Joan had been a witch, a heretic, an impostor, an
apostate, as was declared in her condemnation, then the King had won his
battles by the help of a heretic and a witch. Twenty years after Joanâs
martyrdom, when the King had recovered Normandy and Rouen, he thought it
time to take care of his own character, and to inquire into the charges
on which she was found guilty. It is fair to say that he could not do
this properly till he was master of Rouen, the place at which she was
tried. Some of the people concerned were asked questions, such as the
good clerk, Manchon, and DeaupÃ¨rc, one of the Judges. He was a man of
some sense: he did not think that Joan was a witch, but that she was a
fanciful girl, who thought that she saw Saints and heard Voices, when
she neither saw nor heard anything. Many mad people hear Voices which
are also mad; Joanâs Voices were perfectly sane and wise, and told her
things that she could not have known of herself.

Not much came of this examination, but, two years later, Joanâs mother
and brothers prayed for a new trial to clear the character of the
family. It is the most extraordinary thing that, up to this year, 1452,
Joanâs brothers and cousins seem to have been living, on the best terms,
with the woman who pretended to be Joan, and said that she had not been
burned, but had escaped. This was a jolly kind of woman, fond of eating
and drinking and playing tennis.

Why Joanâs brothers and cousins continued to be friendly with her after
the King found her out, because she did not know his secret, is the
greatest of puzzles, for she was a detected impostor, and no money could
be got from the connection with her. Another very amazing thing is
that, in 1436, an aunt of the Duke of Burgundy, Madame de Luxembourg,
entertained the impostor, while the whole town of Orleans welcomed her,
and made her presents, and ceased holding a religious service on the
day of Joanâs death, for here, they said, she was, quite well and merry!
Moreover the townâs books of accounts, at Orleans, show that they paid a
pension to Joanâs mother as âMother of the Maid,â till 1452, when they
say âMother of the _late_ Maid.â For now, as Joanâs family were trying
to have her character cleared, they admitted that she was dead, burned
to death in 1431, as, of course, she really was. There are not many
things more curious than this story of the False Maid.

However, at last Joanâs family gave up the impostor, and, five years
later, she was imprisoned, and let out again, and that is the last we
hear of her. The new Trial lingered on, was begun, and put off, and
begun again in 1455. Cauchon was dead by this time; nothing could be
done to him. Scores of witnesses came and told the stories given at the
beginning of this book, showing how Joan was the best and most religious
of girls, and very kind to people even more poor than herself, and very
industrious in knitting and sewing and helping her mother. Every one who
was still alive, that had known her in the wars, came, like dâAlenÃ§on,
and Dunois, and dâAulon, and her confessor: and many others came, and
told about Joan in the wars, how brave she was and modest, and the
stories of what she had suffered in prison, and about the unfairness of
her trial, were repeated.

The end was that the Court of Inquiry-declared her trial to have been
full of unlawfulness and cruelty, and they abolished the sentence
against her and took off all the shameful reproaches, and ordered a
beautiful cross to be erected to her memory in the place where she was
burned to death.

So here ends the story of the Life and Death of Joan the Maid.

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
âDefects,â such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tmâs
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

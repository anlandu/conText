Then double-click on 8800-h; you will see several directories: you may rename the directory named files to any name you wish, such as DANTE.

you will find a file named INDEX.HTM in capital letters, this html file
can only be used here; a shortcut to it may be installed on your desktop
or any directory on your computer. This index file or its shorcut allows

5. This archive of Project Gutenberg eBooks in the files directory (see instruction #3) also includes, in addition to the usual HTML files for your computer, two sets of mobile viewer files for Kindles, Nooks and others which use .mobi or .epub formats. There is no index for these as after you download them to your mobile viewer it will automatially list the new title names in the usual place. The directories are named: "EPUB" and "KINDLE". Double click on the directory which applies to your mobile viewer and move all the enclosed files to your device using the same connection technique you are familiar with when you have downloaded any commercial eBooks from your computer.

PREFATORY NOTE

The legend of the magician Faust and his compact with the Devil comes
from remote antiquity. At first in the form of folk tales in many
lands, through ballads and the primitive drama it found its way into
literature. It remained for the master-poet, Goethe, to fuse all the
elements of the legend into an imaginative drama of unequaled ethical
and poetic interest, to give the story the form in which it appeals
most strongly to the modern mind.

Innumerable musical works of every form have drawn inspiration from
the story of Faust. Wagner's concert-overture, Liszt's symphony, and
the beautiful fragments by Schumann are among the noblest of such
works. Stage versions of the legend have been numerous, but the first
really poetic creation was Spohr's opera of "Faust," composed in 1813.
Since its appearance there has been an abundance of Faust operas by
English, German, French and Italian composers down to the imaginative
but fragmentary "Mefistofele" of Boito (1868). But of all the stage
versions that have claimed the public attention, that of Barbier and
Carré, made after Goethe's drama and set to music by Charles Gounod, is
far and away the most popular, and may be regarded, in its lyric dress,
as the most successful also. There exists scarcely a single rival to
the popularity of Gounod's "Faust" among opera-goers.

The love story with which the French librettists concerned themselves
exclusively is wholly Goethe's conception, and finds no place in the
old legends concerning the magician Faust. With true Gallic instinct
they seized this pathetic episode as being best adapted for a lyric
setting, and making the most potent appeal to the emotions of the
spectators. But to the composer himself is due the credit of suggesting
the story of Faust as a suitable subject for musical treatment.




THE STORY OF THE ACTION


ACT I.--Faust, an aged philosopher, who has grown weary of life, and
of the vain search for the source of all knowledge, decides, after a
nightlong vigil, to end his existence by taking poison. In the act
of raising the cup to his lips his hand is arrested by the sound of
merry voices of maidens singing in the early morning of the joy of
living. Again he essays to drink, but pauses to listen to the song of
the reapers on their way to the fields, voicing their gratitude to
God. Excited to a frenzy of rage, Faust curses all that is good and
calls upon the Evil One to aid him. Mephistopheles appears, and offers
gold, glory, boundless power; but the aged doctor craves youth, its
passions and delights. The fiend agrees that all shall be his if he
but sign a compact, by which the devil serves Faust on earth, but in
the hereafter below the relation is to be reversed. Faust wavers at
first, but a vision of Marguerite appears, which inflames his ardor and
dispels his hesitation; he drinks the potion and is transformed into a
young and handsome man.


ACT II.--A Kermesse or town fair. Groups of students, soldiers, old
men, maids and matrons fill the scene. Valentine, the brother of
Marguerite, about to leave for the wars, commends his sister to the
care of Siebel, who timidly adores her. While Wagner, a student, is
attempting a song, he is interrupted by Mephistopheles who volunteers
to sing him a better one (the mocking "Calf of Gold"). Then the fiend
causes a fiery liquor to flow miraculously from the tavern sign, and
proposes the health of Marguerite. Valentine resents the insult, but
his sword is broken in his hand, and Mephistopheles draws a magic
circle around himself and bids defiance to the rapiers of the soldiers.
These, now suspecting his evil nature, hold their cruciform sword-hilts
toward Mephistopheles, who cowers away at the holy symbol. The fête is
resumed; in the midst of the revelry Marguerite enters, returning home
from church. Faust offers to escort her home, but she timidly declines
his assistance, and leaves him enamoured of her beauty. The act closes
with a merry dance of the townspeople.


ACT III.--The scene shows the garden of Marguerite's dwelling. Siebel
enters to leave a nosegay on the doorstep of his charmer. The flowers
he plucks wither at his touch, due to an evil spell cast upon him by
the fiend, which he, however, breaks by dipping his hand in holy water.
Faust and Mephistopheles conceal themselves in the garden after having
left a casket of jewels on the doorstep near Siebel's modest offering.
Marguerite returns home and seats herself at the spinning-wheel,
singing the while a song of the "King of Thule." But she interrupts the
song to dream of the handsome stranger who had spoken to her at the
fête. Upon discovering the jewels, she cannot forbear to adorn herself.
While thus occupied, Faust and his evil ally appear. The latter engages
the girl's flighty neighbor, Martha, in conversation, while Faust
pleads his passion's cause successfully with Marguerite.


ACT IV.--Betrayed and deserted by her lover, Marguerite must bear the
scorn of her former companions. Siebel alone is faithful, and speaks
comforting words. She goes to the church to pray; but her supplications
are interrupted by the mocking fiend at her elbow, by the accusing
cries of demons, and by the stern chants of the worshipers. Finally
Mephistopheles appears to the sight of the wretched girl, who swoons
with terror.

The return of the victorious soldiers brings back Valentine, who
hears evil stories of his sister's condition. Aroused by an insulting
serenade which Mephistopheles, accompanied by Faust, sings beneath
Marguerite's window, Valentine engages in a duel with the latter and is
wounded to the death. Dying, he curses Marguerite, who comes from the
church to his side, and accuses her of bringing him to his end.


ACT V.--Marguerite, her reason shaken by her misfortunes, has killed
her child, and for this crime she is thrown into prison, and condemned
to die. Faust, aided by Mephistopheles, obtains access to her cell
and urges her to fly with him; but her poor mind cannot grasp the
situation, and recurs only to the scenes of their love. When she sees
Faust's companion, she turns from him in horror, falls upon her knees,
and implores the mercy of heaven. As she sinks in death, Mephistopheles
pronounces her damned, but a heavenly voice proclaims her pardoned; and
while a celestial choir chants the Easter hymn the soul of Marguerite
is seen borne up to heaven by angels. Faust falls to his knees, and the
devil crouches beneath the shining sword of an archangel.

_Faust's Study._

(Night. FAUST discovered, alone. He is seated at a table covered
with books and parchments; an open book lies before him. His lamp is
flickering in the socket.)

_Faust._ No! In vain hath my soul aspired, with ardent longing,
         All to know,--all in earth and heaven.
         No light illumines the visions, ever thronging
         My brain; no peace is given,
         And I linger, thus sad and weary,
         Without power to sunder the chain
         Binding my soul to life always dreary.
         Nought do I see! Nought do I know!
    (He closes the book and rises. Day begins to dawn.)

         Again 'tis light!
         On its westward course flying,
         The somber night vanishes.
                    (Despairingly.)
         Again the light of a new day!
         O death! when will thy dusky wings
         Above me hover and give me--rest?

                (Seizing a flask on the table.)
         Well, then! Since death thus evades me,
         Why should I not go in search of him?
         Hail, my final day, all hail!
         No fears my heart assail;
         On earth my days I number;
         For this draught immortal slumber
         Will secure me, and care dispel!

    (Pours liquid from the flask into a crystal goblet. Just as he is
about to raise it to his lips, the following chorus is heard, without.)

_Cho. of Maidens._ Why thy eyes so lustrous
         Hidest thou from sight?
         Bright Sol now is scatt'ring
         Beams of golden light;
         The nightingale is warbling
         Its carol of love;
         Rosy tints of morning
         Now gleam from above;
         Flow'rs unfold their beauty
         To the scented gale;
         Nature all awakens--
         Of love tells its tale.

_Faust._ Hence, empty sounds of human joys
         Flee far from me.
         O goblet, which my ancestors
         So many times have filled,
         Why tremblest thou in my grasp?
              (Again raising the goblet to his lips.)
_Cho. of Laborers_
                    (without).
         The morn into the fields doth summon us,
         The swallow hastes away!
         Why tarry, then?
         To labor let's away! to work let's on,
         The sky is bright, the earth is fair,
         Our tribute, then, let's pay to heav'n.

_Cho. of Maidens and Laborers._
         Praises to God!

_Faust._ God! God!
              (He sinks into a chair.)
         But this God, what will he do for me?
                      (Rising.)
         Will he return to me youth, love, and faith?
                    (With rage.)
         Cursed be all of man's vile race!
         Cursed be the chains which bind him in his place!
         Cursed be visions false, deceiving!
         Cursed the folly of believing!
         Cursed be dreams of love or hate!
         Cursed be souls with joy elate.
         Cursed be science, prayer, and faith!
         Cursed my fate in life and death!
              Infernal king, arise!

         Here am I! So, I surprise you?
         SATAN, Sir, at your service!
         A sword at my side; on my hat a gay feather;--
         A cloak o'er my shoulder; and altogether,
         Why, gotten up quite in the fashion!
                     (Briskly.)
         But come, Doctor Faust, what is your will?
         Behold! Speak! Are you afraid of me?

_Faust._ No.

_Mep._   Do you doubt my power?

_Faust._ Perhaps.

_Mep._   Prove it, then.

_Faust._ Begone!

_Mep._   Fie! Fie! Is this your politeness!
         But learn, my friend, that with Satan
         One should conduct in a different way.
         I've entered your door with infinite trouble.
         Would you kick me out the very same day?

_Faust._ Then what will you do for me?

_Mep._   Anything in the world! All things. But
         Say first what you would have.
         Abundance of gold?

_Faust._ And what can I do with riches?

_Mep._   Good. I see where the shoe pinches.
         You will have glory.

_Faust._ Still wrong.

_Mep._   Power, then.

_Faust._ No. I would have a treasure
         Which contains all. I wish for youth.
         Oh! I would have pleasure,
         And love, and caresses,
         For youth is the season
         When joy most impresses.
         One round of enjoyment,
         One scene of delight,
         Should be my employment
         From day-dawn till night.
         Oh, I would have pleasure,
         And love, and caresses;
         If youth you restore me,
         My joys I'll renew!

_Mep._   'Tis well--all thou desirest I can give thee.

_Faust._ Ah! but what must I give in return?

_Mep._   'Tis but little:
         In this world I will be thy slave,
         But down below thou must be mine.

_Faust._ Below!

_Mep._   Below.
                  (Unfolding a scroll.)
         Come, write. What! does thy hand tremble?
         Whence this dire trepidation?
         'Tis youth that now awaits thee--Behold!

(At a sign from MEPHISTOPHELES, the scene opens
and discloses MARGUERITE, spinning.)

_Faust._ Oh, wonder!

_Mep._   Well, how do you like it?
                 (Taking parchment.)
_Faust._ Give me the scroll!
                     (Signs.)
_Mep._   Come on then! And now, master,
                  (Taking cup from the table.)
         I invite thee to empty a cup,
         In which there is neither poison nor death,
         But young and vigorous life.

_Faust._
               (Taking cup and turning toward Marguerite.)
         O beautiful, adorable vision! I drink to thee!

    (He drinks the contents of the cup, and is transformed
  into a young and handsome man. The vision disappears.)

_Mep._   Come, then.

_Faust._ Say, shall I again behold her?

_Mep._   Most surely!

_Faust._ When?

_Mep._   This very day!

_Faust._ 'Tis well.

_Mep._   Then let's away.

_Both._  'Tis pleasure I covet,
         'Tis beauty I crave;

_Citizens._ On holy-days and feast-days,

         Worry their brains with affairs,
         I stroll calmly to this retreat

         Just to take one glance.

  WAGNER, SIEBEL, VALENTINE, Students, and afterwards MEPHISTOPHELES.

_Val._
   (advancing from the back of the stage and holding in his hand
  a small silver medal).
         O sacred medallion,
           Gift of my sister dear
           To ward off danger and fear,
         As I charge with my brave battalion,
           Rest thou upon my heart.

_Wag._   Here comes Valentine, in search of us, doubtless.

_Val._   Let us drain the parting cup, comrades,
         It is time we were on the road.

_Wag._   What sayst thou?
         Why this sorrowful farewell?

_Val._   Like you, I soon must quit these scenes,
         Leaving behind me Marguerite.
         Alas! my mother no longer lives,
         To care for and protect her.

_Sie._   More than one friend hast thou
         Who faithfully will thy place supply.

_Val._   My thanks!

_Sie._   On me you may rely.

_Stud._  In us thou surely mayst confide.

_Val._   Even bravest heart may swell
         In the moment of farewell.
         Loving smile of sister kind,
         Quiet home I leave behind.
         Oft shall I think of you
         Whene'er the wine-cup passes round,
         When alone my watch I keep.
         But when danger to glory shall call me,
         I still will be first in the fray,
         As blithe as a knight in his bridal array.
         Careless what fate shall befall me
         When glory shall call me.

_Wag._   Come on, friends! No tears nor vain alarms;
         Quaff we good wine, to the success of our arms!
         Drink, boys, drink!
         In a joyous refrain
         Bid farewell, till we meet again.

         Once more in song our voices
         Let us raise.

_Wag._

_Wag._   What!

_Mep._   If it so please ye I should wish
         To mingle with ye a short time.
         If your good friend will kindly end his song,
         I'll tell ye a few things well worth the hearing.

_Wag._   One will suffice, but let that one be good.

_Mep._   My utmost I will do
         Your worships not to bore.

         Crowds before his vile shape bowing,
         The monster dares insult the skies.
         With contempt he views around him
         All the vaunted human race,
         As they strive in abject toil,
         As with souls debased they circle
         Round about the pedestal.
         Satan, he conducts the ball.

_All._   Satan, he conducts the ball.

_Cho._   A strange story this of thine.

_Val._
                 (aside).
         And stranger still is he who sings it.

_Wag._
          (offering a cup to MEPHISTOPHELES).
         Will you honor us by partaking of wine?

_Mep._   With pleasure. Ah!
      (Taking WAGNER by the hand, and scrutinizing his palm.)
         Behold what saddens me to view.
         See you this line?

_Wag._   Well!

_Mep._   A sudden death it presages,--
         You will be killed in mounting to th' assault!

_Sie._   You are then a sorcerer!

_Mep._   Even so. And your own hand shows plainly
         To what fate condemns. What flower you would gather
         Shall wither in the grasp.

_Sie._   I?

_Mep._   No more bouquets for Marguerite.

_Val._   My sister! How knew you her name?

_Mep._   Take care, my brave fellow!
         Some one I know is destined to kill you.

_Val._   Enough! If I do not silence him,
         And that instantly, I will die.

_Mep._   Oh, nothing! let us change the subject!
         Say, Doctor, what would you of me?
         With what shall we begin?

_Faust._ Where bides the beauteous maid
         Thine art did show to me?
         Or was't mere witchcraft?

_Mep._   No, but her virtue doth protect her from thee,
         And heaven itself would keep her pure.

_Faust._ It matters not!
         Come, lead me to her,
         Or I straightway abandon thee.

_Mep._   Then I'll comply! 'twere pity you should think

         We were not born with true love to trifle,
         Nor born to part because the wind blows cold.

         Oh, Marguerite! oh, Marguerite!
         Still on the bough is left a leaf of gold.

_Mar._   Bless you, my friend, your sympathy is sweet.

         Cannot close against me

         For him and for our child.

         To prostrate herself before thine altar.

_Mep._   No, thou shalt not pray!

  who bends over to MARGUERITE's ear.)

_Mep._   Remember the glorious days
         When an angel's wings
         Protected thy young heart.
         To church thou camest then to worship,
         Nor hadst thou then sinned 'gainst heaven.
         Thy prayers then issued
         From an unstained heart
         And on the wings of faith
         Did rise to the Creator.

         Hell claims thee for its own!
         Eternal pain, and woe, and tribulation,
         Will be thy portion!

_Mar._   Heaven! what voice is this
         That in the shade doth speak to me?
         What mysterious tones are these!

_Religious Cho._ When the last day shall have come,
         The cross in heaven shall shine forth,
         This world to dust shall crumble.

_Mar._   Ah me! more fearful still becomes their song.

_Mep._   No pardon hath heaven left for thee!
         For thee e'en heaven hath no more light!

_Religious Cho._ What shall we say unto high heav'n?
         Who shall protection find
         When innocence such persecution meets?

_Mar._   A heavy weight my breast o'erpowers,--
         I can no longer breathe!

_Mep._   Nights of love, farewell!

         She'll be to hear me tell

         Brought shame and sorrow hither.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

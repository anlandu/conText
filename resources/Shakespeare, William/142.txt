The Tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark:
 a study of the text of the folio of 1623
          By George MacDonald
[Motto]: "What would you, gracious figure?"

Dr. Greville MacDonald looks on his father's commentary as the "most
important interpretation of the play ever written... It is his intuitive
understanding ... rather than learned analysis--of which there is yet
overwhelming evidence--that makes it so splendid."

Reading Level: Mature youth and adults.




PREFACE


By this edition of HAMLET I hope to help the student of Shakspere to
understand the play--and first of all Hamlet himself, whose spiritual
and moral nature are the real material of the tragedy, to which every
other interest of the play is subservient. But while mainly attempting,
from the words and behaviour Shakspere has given him, to explain the
man, I have cast what light I could upon everything in the play,
including the perplexities arising from extreme condensation of meaning,
figure, and expression.

As it is more than desirable that the student should know when he is
reading the most approximate presentation accessible of what Shakspere
uttered, and when that which modern editors have, with reason good or
bad, often not without presumption, substituted for that which they
received, I have given the text, letter for letter, point for point, of
the First Folio, with the variations of the Second Quarto in the margin
and at the foot of the page.

Of HAMLET there are but two editions of authority, those called the
Second Quarto and the First Folio; but there is another which requires
remark.

In the year 1603 came out the edition known as the First Quarto--clearly
without the poet's permission, and doubtless as much to his displeasure:
the following year he sent out an edition very different, and larger in
the proportion of one hundred pages to sixty-four. Concerning the former
my theory is--though it is not my business to enter into the question
here--that it was printed from Shakspere's sketch for the play, written
with matter crowding upon him too fast for expansion or development, and
intended only for a continuous memorandum of things he would take up and
work out afterwards. It seems almost at times as if he but marked
certain bales of thought so as to find them again, and for the present
threw them aside--knowing that by the marks he could recall the thoughts
they stood for, but not intending thereby to convey them to any reader.
I cannot, with evidence before me, incredible but through the eyes
themselves, of the illimitable scope of printers' blundering, believe
_all_ the confusion, unintelligibility, neglect of grammar,
construction, continuity, sense, attributable to them. In parts it is
more like a series of notes printed with the interlineations horribly
jumbled; while in other parts it looks as if it had been taken down from
the stage by an ear without a brain, and then yet more incorrectly
printed; parts, nevertheless, in which it most differs from the
authorized editions, are yet indubitably from the hand of Shakspere. I
greatly doubt if any ready-writer would have dared publish some of its
chaotic passages as taken down from the stage; nor do I believe the play
was ever presented in anything like such an unfinished state. I rather
think some fellow about the theatre, whether more rogue or fool we will
pay him the thankful tribute not to enquire, chancing upon the crude
embryonic mass in the poet's hand, traitorously pounced upon it, and
betrayed it to the printers--therein serving the poet such an evil turn
as if a sculptor's workman took a mould of the clay figure on which his
master had been but a few days employed, and published casts of it as
the sculptor's work.[1] To us not the less is the _corpus delicti_
precious--and that unspeakably--for it enables us to see something of
the creational development of the drama, besides serving occasionally to
cast light upon portions of it, yielding hints of the original intention
where the after work has less plainly presented it.

[Footnote 1: Shakspere has in this matter fared even worse than Sir
Thomas Browne, the first edition of whose _Religio Medici_, nowise
intended for the public, was printed without his knowledge.]

The Second Quarto bears on its title-page, compelled to a recognition of
the former,--'Newly imprinted and enlarged to almost as much againe as
it was, according to the true and perfect Coppie'; and it is in truth a
harmonious world of which the former issue was but the chaos. It is the
drama itself, the concluded work of the master's hand, though yet to be
once more subjected to a little pruning, a little touching, a little
rectifying. But the author would seem to have been as trusting over the
work of the printers, as they were careless of his, and the result is
sometimes pitiable. The blunders are appalling. Both in it and in the
Folio the marginal note again and again suggests itself: 'Here the
compositor was drunk, the press-reader asleep, the devil only aware.'
But though the blunders elbow one another in tumultuous fashion, not
therefore all words and phrases supposed to be such are blunders. The
old superstition of plenary inspiration may, by its reverence for the
very word, have saved many a meaning from the obliteration of a
misunderstanding scribe: in all critical work it seems to me well to
cling to the _word_ until one sinks not merely baffled, but exhausted.

I come now to the relation between the Second Quarto and the Folio.

My theory is--that Shakspere worked upon his own copy of the Second
Quarto, cancelling and adding, and that, after his death, this copy
came, along with original manuscripts, into the hands of his friends the
editors of the Folio, who proceeded to print according to his
alterations.

These friends and editors in their preface profess thus: 'It had bene a
thing, we confesse, worthie to haue bene wished, that the Author
himselfe had liu'd to haue set forth, and ouerseen his owne writings;
But since it hath bin ordain'd otherwise, and he by death departed from
that right, we pray you do not envie his Friends, the office of their
care, and paine, to haue collected & publish'd them, as where (before)
you were abus'd with diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies, maimed,
and deformed by the frauds and stealthes of iniurious impostors, that
expos'd them: euen those, are now offer'd to your view cur'd, and
perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in their numbers, as
he conceiued th[=e]. Who, as he was a happie imitator of Nature, was a
most gentle expresser of it. His mind and hand went together: And what
he thought, he vttered with that easinesse, that wee haue scarse
receiued from him a blot in his papers. But it is not our prouince, who
onely gather his works, and giue them you, to praise him. It is yours
that reade him.'

These are hardly the words of men who would take liberties, and
liberties enormous, after ideas of their own, with the text of a friend
thus honoured. But although they printed with intent altogether
faithful, they did so certainly without any adequate jealousy of the
printers--apparently without a suspicion of how they could blunder. Of
blunders therefore in the Folio also there are many, some through mere
following of blundered print, some in fresh corruption of the same, some
through mistaking of the manuscript corrections, and some probably from
the misprinting of mistakes, so that the corrections themselves are at
times anything but correctly recorded. I assume also that the printers
were not altogether above the mean passion, common to the day-labourers
of Art, from Chaucer's Adam Scrivener down to the present carvers of
marble, for modifying and improving the work of the master. The vain
incapacity of a self-constituted critic will make him regard his poorest
fancy as an emendation; seldom has he the insight of Touchstone to
recognize, or his modesty to acknowledge, that although his own, it is
none the less an ill-favoured thing.

Not such, however, was the spirit of the editors; and all the changes of
importance from the text of the Quarto I receive as Shakspere's own.
With this belief there can be no presumption in saying that they seem to
me not only to trim the parts immediately affected, but to render the
play more harmonious and consistent. It is no presumption to take the
Poet for superior to his work and capable of thinking he could better
it--neither, so believing, to imagine one can see that he has been
successful.

A main argument for the acceptance of the Folio edition as the Poet's
last presentment of his work, lies in the fact that there are passages
in it which are not in the Quarto, and are very plainly from his hand.
If we accept these, what right have we to regard the omission from the
Folio of passages in the Quarto as not proceeding from the same hand?
Had there been omissions only, we might well have doubted; but the
insertions greatly tend to remove the doubt. I cannot even imagine the
arguments which would prevail upon me to accept the latter and refuse
the former. Omission itself shows for a master-hand: see the magnificent
passage omitted, and rightly, by Milton from the opening of his _Comus_.

'But when a man has published two forms of a thing, may we not judge
between him and himself, and take the reading we like better?'
Assuredly. Take either the Quarto or the Folio; both are Shakspere's.
Take any reading from either, and defend it. But do not mix up the two,
retaining what he omits along with what he inserts, and print them so.
This is what the editors do--and the thing is not Shakspere's. With
homage like this, no artist could be other than indignant. It is well to
show every difference, even to one of spelling where it might indicate
possibly a different word, but there ought to be no mingling of
differences. If I prefer the reading of the Quarto to that of the Folio,
as may sometimes well happen where blunders so abound, I say I
_prefer_--I do not dare to substitute. My student shall owe nothing of
his text to any but the editors of the Folio, John Heminge and Henrie
Condell.

I desire to take him with me. I intend a continuous, but ever-varying,
while one-ended lesson. We shall follow the play step by step, avoiding
almost nothing that suggests difficulty, and noting everything that
seems to throw light on the character of a person of the drama. The
pointing I consider a matter to be dealt with as any one pleases--for
the sake of sense, of more sense, of better sense, as much as if the
text were a Greek manuscript without any division of words. This
position I need not argue with anyone who has given but a cursory glance
to the original page, or knows anything of printers' pointing. I hold
hard by the word, for that is, or may be, grain: the pointing as we have
it is merest chaff, and more likely to be wrong than right. Here also,
however, I change nothing in the text, only suggest in the notes. Nor do
I remark on any of the pointing where all that is required is the
attention of the student.

Doubtless many will consider not a few of the notes unnecessary. But
what may be unnecessary to one, may be welcome to another, and it is
impossible to tell what a student may or may not know. At the same time
those form a large class who imagine they know a thing when they do not
understand it enough to see there is a difficulty in it: to such, an
attempt at explanation must of course seem foolish.

A _number_ in the margin refers to a passage of the play or in the
notes, and is the number of the page where the passage is to be found.
If the student finds, for instance, against a certain line upon page 8,
the number 12, and turns to page 12, he will there find the number 8
against a certain line: the two lines or passages are to be compared,
and will be found in some way parallel, or mutually explanatory.

Wherever I refer to the Quarto, I intend the 2nd Quarto--that is
Shakspere's own authorized edition, published in his life-time. Where
occasionally I refer to the surreptitious edition, the mere inchoation
of the drama, I call it, as it is, the _1st Quarto_.

Any word or phrase or stage-direction in the 2nd Quarto differing from
that in the Folio, is placed on the margin in a line with the other:
choice between them I generally leave to my student. Omissions are
mainly given as footnotes. Each edition does something to correct the
errors of the other.

I beg my companion on this journey to let Hamlet reveal himself in the
play, to observe him as he assumes individuality by the concretion of
characteristics. I warn him that any popular notion concerning him which
he may bring with him, will be only obstructive to a perception of the
true idea of the grandest of all Shakspere's presentations.

It will amuse this and that man to remark how often I speak of Hamlet as
if he were a real man and not the invention of Shakspere--for indeed the
Hamlet of the old story is no more that of Shakspere than a lump of coal
is a diamond; but I imagine, if he tried the thing himself, he would
find it hardly possible to avoid so speaking, and at the same time say
what he had to say.

I give hearty thanks to the press-reader, a gentleman whose name I do
not know, not only for keen watchfulness over the printing-difficulties
of the book, but for saving me from several blunders in derivation.

[Transcriber's Note: In the paper original, each left-facing page
contained the text of the play, with sidenotes and footnote references,
and the corresponding right-facing page contained the footnotes
themselves and additional commentary. In this electronic text, the
play-text pages are numbered (contrary to custom in electronic texts),
to allow use of the cross-references provided in the sidenotes and
footnotes. In the play text, sidenotes towards the left of the page are
those marginal cross-references described earlier, and sidenotes toward
the right of the page are the differences noted a few paragraphs later.]

_Hor._ Before my God, I might not this beleeue
Without the sensible and true auouch
Of mine owne eyes.

_Mar._ Is it not like the King?

_Hor._ As thou art to thy selfe,
Such was the very Armour he had on,
When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted: [Sidenote: when he the ambitious]
So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.[8]         [Sidenote: sleaded[7]]
'Tis strange.

[Sidenote: 274] _Mar._ Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
                                            [Sidenote: and jump at this]

[Footnote 1: _1st Q_. 'horrors mee'.]

[Footnote 2: A ghost could not speak, it was believed, until it was
spoken to.]

[Footnote 3: It was intruding upon the realm of the embodied.]

[Footnote 4: None of them took it as certainly the late king: it was
only clear to them that it was like him. Hence they say, 'usurp'st the
forme.']

[Footnote 5: _formerly_.]

[Footnote 6: --at the word _usurp'st_.]

[Footnote 7: Also _1st Q_.]

[Footnote 8: The usual interpretation is 'the sledged Poles'; but not to
mention that in a parley such action would have been treacherous, there
is another far more picturesque, and more befitting the _angry parle_,
at the same time more characteristic and forcible: the king in his anger
smote his loaded pole-axe on the ice. There is some uncertainty about
the word _sledded_ or _sleaded_ (which latter suggests _lead_), but we
have the word _sledge_ and _sledge-hammer_, the smith's heaviest, and
the phrase, 'a sledging blow.' The quarrel on the occasion referred to
rather seems with the Norwegians (See Schmidt's _Shakespeare-Lexicon:
Sledded_.) than with the Poles; and there would be no doubt as to the
latter interpretation being the right one, were it not that _the
Polacke_, for the Pole, or nation of the Poles, does occur in the play.
That is, however, no reason why the Dane should not have carried a
pole-axe, or caught one from the hand of an attendant. In both our
authorities, and in the _1st Q_. also, the word is _pollax_--as in
Chaucer's _Knights Tale_: 'No maner schot, ne pollax, ne schort
knyf,'--in the _Folio_ alone with a capital; whereas not once in the
play is the similar word that stands for the Poles used in the plural.
In the _2nd Quarto_ there is _Pollacke_ three times, _Pollack_ once,
_Pole_ once; in the _1st Quarto_, _Polacke_ twice; in the _Folio_,
_Poleak_ twice, _Polake_ once. The Poet seems to have avoided the plural
form.]

The graues stood tennatlesse, and the sheeted dead
Did squeake and gibber in the Roman streets[7]
As starres with traines of fier, and dewes of blood
Disasters in the sunne; and the moist starre,
Vpon whose influence _Neptunes_ Empier stands
Was sicke almost to doomesday with eclipse.
And euen the like precurse of feare euents
As harbindgers preceading still the fates
And prologue to the _Omen_ comming on

The tenth will close with the twelfth line well enough.

But no one, any more than myself, will be _satisfied_ with the
suggestion. The probability is, of course, that a line has dropped out
between the fifth and sixth. Anything like this would restore the
connection:

[Footnote 1: An _aside_. Hamlet's first utterance is of dislike to his
uncle. He is more than _kin_ through his unwelcome marriage--less than
_kind_ by the difference in their natures. To be _kind_ is to behave as
one _kinned_ or related. But the word here is the noun, and means
_nature_, or sort by birth.]

[Footnote 2: A word-play may be here intended between _sun_ and _son_:
_a little more than kin--too much i' th' Son_. So George Herbert:

    For when he sees my ways, I die;
    But I have got his _Son_, and he hath none;

and Dr. Donne:

    Shall shine, as he shines now and heretofore.]

[Footnote 6: 'Plainly you treat it as a common matter--a thing of no
significance!' _I_ is constantly used for _ay_, _yes_.]

[Footnote 7: He pounces on the word _seems_.]

[Footnote 8: Not unfrequently the type would appear to have been set up
from dictation.]

[Footnote 9: They are things of the outside, and must _seem_, for they
are capable of being imitated; they are the natural _shows_ of grief.
But he has that in him which cannot _show_ or _seem_, because nothing
can represent it. These are 'the Trappings and the Suites of _woe_;'
they fitly represent woe, but they cannot shadow forth that which is
within him--a something different from woe, far beyond it and worse,
passing all reach of embodiment and manifestation. What this something
is, comes out the moment he is left by himself.]

[Footnote 10: The emphasis is on _might_.]

[Footnote 11: Both his uncle and his mother decline to understand him.
They will have it he mourns the death of his father, though they must at
least suspect another cause for his grief. Note the intellectual mastery
of the hypocrite--which accounts for his success.]

the university where in 1508 Luther was appointed professor of
Philosophy. Compare 19. There was love of study as well as disgust with
home in his desire to return to _Schoole_: this from what we know of him
afterwards.]

[Footnote 2: A soliloquy is as the drawing called a section of a thing:
it shows the inside of the man. Soliloquy is only rare, not unnatural,
and in art serves to reveal more of nature. In the drama it is the
lifting of a veil through which dialogue passes. The scene is for the
moment shifted into the lonely spiritual world, and here we begin to
know Hamlet. Such is his wretchedness, both in mind and circumstance,
that he could well wish to vanish from the world. The suggestion of
suicide, however, he dismisses at once--with a momentary regret, it is
true--but he dismisses it--as against the will of God to whom he appeals
in his misery. The cause of his misery is now made plain to us--his
trouble that passes show, deprives life of its interest, and renders the
world a disgust to him. There is no lamentation over his father's death,
so dwelt upon by the king; for loving grief does not crush. Far less
could his uncle's sharp practice, in scheming for his own election
during Hamlet's absence, have wrought in a philosopher like him such an
effect. The one makes him sorrowful, the other might well annoy him, but
neither could render him unhappy: his misery lies at his mother's door;
it is her conduct that has put out the light of her son's life. She who
had been to him the type of all excellence, she whom his father had
idolized, has within a month of his death married his uncle, and is
living in habitual incest--for as such, a marriage of the kind was then
unanimously regarded. To Hamlet's condition and behaviour, his mother,
her past and her present, is the only and sufficing key. His very idea
of unity had been rent in twain.]

[Footnote 3: _1st Q_. 'too much grieu'd and sallied flesh.' _Sallied_,
sullied: compare _sallets_, 67, 103. I have a strong suspicion that
_sallied_ and not _solid_ is the true word. It comes nearer the depth of
Hamlet's mood.]

[Footnote 4: Two months at the present moment.]

[Footnote 5: This is the word all the editors take: which is right, I do
not know; I doubt if either is. The word in _A Midsummer Night's Dream_,
act i. sc. 1--

    Belike for want of rain; which I could well
    Beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes--

I cannot believe the same word. The latter means _produce for_, as from
the place of origin. The word, in the sense necessary to this passage,
is not, so far as I know, to be found anywhere else. I have no
suggestion to make.]

[Footnote 6: From his mother he generalizes to _woman_. After having
believed in such a mother, it may well be hard for a man to believe in
any woman.]

My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,
Then I to _Hercules_. Within a Moneth?
Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,             [Sidenote: in her]
She married. O most wicked speed, to post[1]
With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:
It is not, nor it cannot come to good,
But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.[2]

_Enter Horatio, Barnard, and Marcellus._
                                  [Sidenote: _Marcellus, and Bernardo._]

_Hor._ Haile to your Lordship.[3]

_Ham._ I am glad to see you well:
_Horatio_, or I do forget my selfe.

_Hor._ The same my Lord,
And your poore Seruant euer.

[Sidenote: 134] _Ham._ [4]Sir my good friend,
Ile change that name with you:[5]
And what make you from Wittenberg _Horatio_?[6]
_Marcellus._[7]

_Mar._ My good Lord.

_Ham._ I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.[8]
But what in faith make you from _Wittemberge_?

_Hor._ A truant disposition, good my Lord.[9]

_Ham._ I would not haue your Enemy say so;[10]     [Sidenote: not heare]
Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,[11]       [Sidenote: my eare]
[Sidenote: 134] To make it truster of your owne report
Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:
But what is your affaire in _Elsenour_?
Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart.[12]

_Hor._ My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall.

[Footnote 3: They do not seem to have been intimate before, though we
know from Hamlet's speech (134) that he had had the greatest respect for
Horatio. The small degree of doubt in Hamlet's recognition of his friend
is due to the darkness, and the unexpectedness of his appearance.]

[Footnote 4: _1st Q._ 'O my good friend, I change, &c.' This would leave
it doubtful whether he wished to exchange servant or friend; but 'Sir,
my _good friend_,' correcting Horatio, makes his intent plain.]

[Footnote 5: Emphasis on _that_: 'I will exchange the name of _friend_
with you.']

[Footnote 6: 'What are you doing from--out of, _away
from_--Wittenberg?']

[Footnote 8: _Point thus_: 'you.--Good even, sir.'--_to Barnardo, whom
he does not know._]

[Footnote 9: An ungrammatical reply. He does not wish to give the real,
painful answer, and so replies confusedly, as if he had been asked,
'What makes you?' instead of, 'What do you make?']

_Hor._ Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon.

_Ham._ Thrift, thrift _Horatio_: the Funerall Bakt-meats
Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;
Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,[1]
Ere I had euer seerie that day _Horatio_.[2]   [Sidenote: Or ever I had]
My father, me thinkes I see my father.

_Hor._ Oh where my Lord?                            [Sidenote: Where my]

_Ham._ In my minds eye (_Horatio_)[3]

_Hor._ I saw him once; he was a goodly King.     [Sidenote: once, a was]

_Ham._ He was a man, take him for all in all:    [Sidenote: A was a man]
I shall not look vpon his like againe.

_Hor._ My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight.

_Ham._ Saw? Who?[4]

_Hor._ My Lord, the King your Father.

_Ham._ The King my Father?[5]

_Hor._ Season[6] your admiration for a while
With an attent eare;[7] till I may deliuer
Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
This maruell to you.

_Ham._ For Heauens loue let me heare.             [Sidenote: God's love]

_Hor._ Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
(_Marcellus_ and _Barnardo_) on their Watch
In the dead wast and middle of the night[8]
Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,[9]
Arm'd at all points exactly, _Cap a Pe_,[10]  [Sidenote: Armed at poynt]
Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
                                     [Sidenote: stately by them; thrice]
By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,
Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd

Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,[12]
Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me
In dreadfull[13] secrecie impart they did,
And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
Whereas[14] they had deliuer'd both in time,

[Footnote 1: _Dear_ is not unfrequently used as an intensive; but 'my
dearest foe' is not 'the man who hates me most,' but 'the man whom most
I regard as my foe.']

supplantation.]

[Footnote 10: _1st Q. 'Capapea_.']

[Footnote 11: Either word would do: the _distilling_ off of the animal
spirits would leave the man a jelly; the cold of fear would _bestil_
them and him to a jelly. _1st Q. distilled_. But I judge _bestil'd_ the
better, as the truer to the operation of fear. Compare _The Winter's
Tale_, act v. sc. 3:--

    There's magic in thy majesty, which has

    From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
    Standing like stone with thee.]

Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,
The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:
These hands are not more like.

_Ham_. But where was this?

_Mar_. My Lord, vpon the platforme where we watcht.    [Sidenote: watch]

_Ham_. Did you not speake to it?

_Her_. My Lord, I did;
But answere made it none: yet once me thought
It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,
And vanisht from our sight.

_Ham_. Tis very strange.

_Hor_. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;
[Sidenote: 14] And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
To let you know of it.

[Sidenote: 32,52] _Ham_. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
                                            [Sidenote: Indeede Sirs but]
Hold you the watch to Night?

_Ham_. Arm'd, say you?

_Both_. Arm'd, my Lord.                               [Sidenote: _All_.]

_Ham_. From top to toe?

_Both_. My Lord, from head to foote.                  [Sidenote: _All_.]

_Ham_. Then saw you not his face?

_Hor_. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp.

_Ham_. What, lookt he frowningly?

[Sidenote: 54,174] _Hor_. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger.[1]

[Sidenote: 120] _Ham_. Pale, or red?

_Hor_. Nay very pale.

[Footnote 1: The mood of the Ghost thus represented, remains the same
towards his wife throughout the play.]

[Page 32]

_Ham._ And fixt his eyes vpon you?

_Hor._ Most constantly.

_Ham._ I would I had beene there.

_Hor._ It would haue much amaz'd you.

_Ham._ Very like, very like: staid it long? [Sidenote: Very like, stayd]

_Hor._ While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred.

_All._ Longer, longer.                               [Sidenote: _Both._]

_Hor._ Not when I saw't.

_Ham._ His Beard was grisly?[1] no.                 [Sidenote: grissl'd]

_Hor._ It was, as I haue seene it in his life,
[Sidenote: 138] A Sable[2] Siluer'd.

_Ham._ Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe.
                                               [Sidenote: walke againe.]

_Hor._ I warrant you it will.                     [Sidenote:  warn't it]

[Sidenote: 44] _Ham._ If it assume my noble Fathers person,[3]
Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape
And bid me hold my peace.  I pray you all,
If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;
Let it bee treble[5] in your silence still: [Sidenote: be tenable in[4]]
And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,      [Sidenote: what someuer els]

_All._  Our duty to your Honour.   _Exeunt._

My Fathers Spirit in Armes?[6] All is not well:

Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,

[Footnote 3: Hamlet does not _accept_ the Appearance as his father; he
thinks it may be he, but seems to take a usurpation of his form for very
possible.]

[Footnote 4: _1st Q_. 'tenible']

[Footnote 5: If _treble_ be the right word, the actor in uttering it
must point to each of the three, with distinct yet rapid motion. The
phrase would be a strange one, but not unlike Shakspere. Compare
_Cymbeline_, act v. sc. 5: 'And your three motives to the battle,'
meaning 'the motives of you three.' Perhaps, however, it is only the
adjective for the adverb: '_having concealed it hitherto, conceal it
trebly now_.' But _tenible_ may be the word: 'let it be a thing to be
kept in your silence still.']

[Footnote 6: Alone, he does not dispute _the idea_ of its being his
father.]

But let me heare from you.

_Ophel_. Doe you doubt that?

_Laer_. For _Hamlet_, and the trifling of his fauours,
                                                     [Sidenote: favour,]
Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloud;
A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;
Froward,[2] not permanent; sweet not lasting

_Ophel_. No more but so.[4]

_Laer_. Thinke it no more.
For nature cressant does not grow alone,
[Sidenote: 172] In thewes[5] and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,[6]

The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,[7]
And now no soyle nor cautell[8] doth besmerch
The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
                                            [Sidenote: of his will, but]
His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;[9]    [Sidenote: wayd]
For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:[10]
Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,
Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
The sanctity and health of the weole State.
                                  [Sidenote: The safty and | this whole]
And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd[11]
Vnto the voyce and yeelding[12] of that Body,
Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,
It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
As he in his peculiar Sect and force[13]
                                [Sidenote: his particuler act and place]
May giue his saying deed: which is no further,

interrogation.]

[Footnote 5: muscles.]

[Footnote 6: The body is the temple, in which the mind and soul are the
worshippers: their service grows with the temple--wide, changing and
increasing its objects. The degraded use of the grand image is after the
character of him who makes it.]

[Footnote 7: The studied contrast between Laertes and Hamlet begins
already to appear: the dishonest man, honestly judging after his own
dishonesty, warns his sister against the honest man.]

[Footnote 8: deceit.]

[Footnote 9: 'You have cause to fear when you consider his greatness:
his will &c.' 'You must fear, his greatness being weighed; for because
of that greatness, his will is not his own.']

[Footnote 10: _This line not in Quarto._]

[Footnote 11: limited.]

[Footnote 12: allowance.]

[Footnote 13: This change from the _Quarto_ seems to me to bear the mark
of Shakspere's hand. The meaning is the same, but the words are more
individual and choice: the _sect_, the _head_ in relation to the body,
is more pregnant than _place_; and _force_, that is _power_, is a fuller
word than _act_, or even _action_, for which it plainly appears to
stand.]

Then the maine voyce of _Denmarke_ goes withall.

Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere.[6]

As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother        [Sidenote: watchman]
Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,
Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;
Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine
Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,
And reaks not his owne reade.[7][8][9]

_Laer_. Oh, feare me not.[10]

_Enter Polonius_.

I stay too long; but here my Father comes:
A double blessing is a double grace;
Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue.[11]

[Footnote 4: Opened but not closed quotations in the _Quarto_.]

[Footnote 5: The French _bouton_ is also both _button_ and _bud_.]

[Footnote 6: 'Inclination is enough to have to deal with, let alone
added temptation.' Like his father, Laertes is wise for another--a man
of maxims, not behaviour. His morality is in his intellect and for
self-ends, not in his will, and for the sake of truth and
righteousness.]

[Footnote 7: _1st Q_.

    But my deere brother, do not you
    Like to a cunning Sophister,
    Teach me the path and ready way to heauen,
    While you forgetting what is said to me,
    Your selfe, like to a carelesse libertine
    Doth giue his heart, his appetite at ful,
    And little recks how that his honour dies.

[Footnote 8: 'heeds not his own counsel.']

[Footnote 9: Here in Quarto, _Enter Polonius._]

[Footnote 10: With the fitting arrogance and impertinence of a libertine
brother, he has read his sister a lecture on propriety of behaviour; but
when she gently suggests that what is good for her is good for him
too,--'Oh, fear me not!--I stay too long.']

[Footnote 11: 'A second leave-taking is a happy chance': the chance, or
occasion, because it is happy, smiles. It does not mean that occasion
smiles upon a second leave, but that, upon a second leave, occasion
smiles. There should be a comma after _smiles_.]

[Footnote 12: As many of Polonius' aphorismic utterances as are given in
the 1st Quarto have there inverted commas; but whether intended as
gleanings from books or as fruits of experience, the light they throw on
the character of him who speaks them is the same: they show it
altogether selfish. He is a man of the world, wise in his generation,
his principles the best of their bad sort. Of these his son is a fit
recipient and retailer, passing on to his sister their father's grand
doctrine of self-protection. But, wise in maxim, Polonius is foolish in
practice--not from senility, but from vanity.]

[Footnote 1: He hurries him to go, yet immediately begins to prose.]

[Footnote 2: Engrave.]

[Footnote 3: Not settled into its true shape (?) or, out of proportion
with its occasions (?)--I cannot say which.]

[Footnote 4: 'Cultivate close relations, but do not lie open to common
access.' 'Have choice intimacies, but do not be _hail, fellow! well met_
with everybody.' What follows is an expansion of the lesson.]

[Footnote 5: 'The friends thou hast--and the choice of them justified by
trial--'_equal to_: 'provided their choice be justified &c.']

[Footnote 6: 'Do not make the palm hard, and dull its touch of
discrimination, by shaking hands in welcome with every one that turns
up.']

[Footnote 7: judgment, opinion.]

[Footnote 8: _Generosus_, of good breed, a gentleman.]

[Footnote 9: _1st Q_. 'generall chiefe.']

[Footnote 10: No doubt the omission of _of a_ gives the right number of
syllables to the verse, and makes room for the interpretation which a
dash between _generous_ and _chief_ renders clearer: 'Are most select
and generous--chief in that,'--'are most choice and well-bred--chief,
indeed--at the head or top, in the matter of dress.' But without
_necessity_ or _authority_--one of the two, I would not throw away a
word; and suggest therefore that Shakspere had here the French idiom _de
son chef_ in his mind, and qualifies the noun in it with adjectives of
his own. The Academy Dictionary gives _de son propre mouvement_ as one
interpretation of the phrase. The meaning would be, 'they are of a most
choice and developed instinct in dress.' _Cheff_ or _chief_ suggests the
upper third of the heraldic shield, but I cannot persuade the suggestion
to further development. The hypercatalectic syllables _of a_, swiftly
spoken, matter little to the verse, especially as it is _dramatic_.]

[Footnote 12: Certainly a man cannot be true to himself without being
true to others; neither can he be true to others without being true to
himself; but if a man make himself the centre for the birth of action,
it will follow, '_as the night the day_,' that he will be true neither
to himself nor to any other man. In this regard note the history of
Laertes, developed in the play.]

[Footnote 2: _1st Q_. 'How prodigall the tongue lends the heart vowes.'
I was inclined to take _Prodigall_ for a noun, a proper name or epithet
given to the soul, as in a moral play: _Prodigall, the soul_; but I
conclude it only an adjective used as an adverb, and the capital P a
blunder.]

entreated:' _entreatments, yieldings_: 'you are not to see him just

[Footnote 6: 'In few words'; in brief.]

[Footnote 7: I suspect a misprint in the Folio here--that an _e_ has got
in for a _d_, and that the change from the _Quarto_ should be _Not of
the dye_. Then the line would mean, using the antecedent word _brokers_
in the bad sense, 'Not themselves of the same colour as their garments
(_investments_); his vows are clothed in innocence, but are not
innocent; they are mere panders.' The passage is rendered yet more
obscure to the modern sense by the accidental propinquity of _bonds,
brokers_, and _investments_--which have nothing to do with _stocks_.]

[Footnote 8: 'This means in sum:'.]

[Footnote 9: 'so slander any moment with the name of leisure as to': to
call it leisure, if leisure stood for talk with Hamlet, would be to
slander the time. We might say, 'so slander any man friend as to expect
him to do this or that unworthy thing for you.']

[Footnote 1: Does Hamlet here call his uncle an _upspring_, an
_upstart_? or is the _upspring_ a dance, the English equivalent of 'the
high _lavolt_' of _Troil. and Cress_. iv. 4, and governed by
_reels_--'keeps wassels, and reels the swaggering upspring'--a dance
that needed all the steadiness as well as agility available, if, as I
suspect, it was that in which each gentleman lifted the lady high, and
kissed her before setting her down? I cannot answer, I can only put the
question. The word _swaggering_ makes me lean to the former
interpretation.]

[Footnote 2: Observe again Hamlet's uncertainty. He does not take it for
granted that it is _his father's_ spirit, though it is plainly his
form.]

[Footnote 3: The Quarto surely came too early for this passage to have
been suggested by the shameful habits which invaded the court through
the example of Anne of Denmark! Perhaps Shakspere cancelled it both
because he would not have it supposed he had meant to reflect on the
queen, and because he came to think it too diffuse.]

[Footnote 4: clepe, _call_.]

[Footnote 5: Same as _attribute_, two lines lower--the thing imputed to,
or added to us--our reputation, our title or epithet.]

[Footnote 6: performed to perfection.]

[Footnote 7: individuals.]

[Footnote 8: A mole on the body, according to the place where it
appeared, was regarded as significant of character: in that relation, a
_vicious mole_ would be one that indicated some special vice; but here
the allusion is to a live mole of constitutional fault, burrowing
within, whose presence the mole-_heap_ on the skin indicates.]

[Footnote 9: The order here would be: 'for some vicious mole of nature
in them, as by their o'er-growth, in their birth--wherein they are not
guilty, since nature cannot choose his origin (or parentage)--their
o'ergrowth of (their being overgrown or possessed by) some complexion,
&c.']

[Footnote 10: _Complexion_, as the exponent of the _temperament_, or
masterful tendency of the nature, stands here for _temperament_--'oft
breaking down &c.' Both words have in them the element of _mingling_--a
mingling to certain results.]

[Footnote 11: The connection is:

    That for some vicious mole--
    As by their o'ergrowth--
    Or by some habit, &c.]

[Footnote 12: pleasing.]

[Footnote 20: Compare Quarto reading, page 112:

    The spirit that I haue scene
    May be a deale, and the deale hath power &c.

If _deale_ here stand for _devil_, then _eale_ may in the same edition
be taken to stand for _evil_. It is hardly necessary to suspect a Scotch
printer; _evil_ is often used as a monosyllable, and _eale_ may have
been a pronunciation of it half-way towards _ill_, which is its
contraction.]

[Footnote 21: I do not believe there is any corruption in the rest of
the passage. 'Doth it of a doubt:' _affects it with a doubt_, brings it
into doubt. The following from _Measure for Measure_, is like, though
not the same.

    I have on Angelo imposed the office,
    Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home
    And yet my nature never in the fight
    _To do in slander._

'To do my nature in slander'; to affect it with slander; to bring it
into slander, 'Angelo may punish in my name, but, not being present, I
shall not be accused of cruelty, which would be to slander my nature.']

_Questionable_ does not mean _doubtful_, but _fit to be questioned_.]

[Footnote 2: 'I'll _call_ thee'--for the nonce.]

[Footnote 3: I think _hearse_ was originally the bier--French _herse_, a
harrow--but came to be applied to the coffin: _hearsed_ in
death--_coffined_ in death.]

[Footnote 4: There is no impropriety in the use of the word _inurned_.
It is a figure--a word once-removed in its application: the sepulchre is
the urn, the body the ashes. _Interred_ Shakspere had concluded
incorrect, for the body was not laid in the earth.]

[Footnote 5: So in _1st Q_.]

[Footnote 6: 'fooles of Nature'--fools in the presence of her
knowledge--to us no knowledge--of her action, to us inexplicable. _A
fact_ that looks unreasonable makes one feel like a fool. See Psalm
lxxiii. 22: 'So foolish was I and ignorant, I was as a beast before
thee.' As some men are our fools, we are all Nature's fools; we are so
far from knowing anything as it is.]

[Footnote 7: Even if Shakspere cared more about grammar than he does, a
man in Hamlet's perturbation he might well present as making a breach in
it; but we are not reduced even to justification. _Toschaken_ (_to_ as
German _zu_ intensive) is a recognized English word; it means _to shake
to pieces_. The construction of the passage is, 'What may this mean,
that thou revisitest thus the glimpses of the moon, and that we so
horridly to-shake our disposition?' So in _The Merry Wives_,

    And fairy-like to-pinch the unclean knight.

'our disposition': our _cosmic structure_.]

[Footnote 8: 'with thoughts that are too much for them, and as an
earthquake to them.']

[Footnote 9: Like all true souls, Hamlet wants to know what he is _to
do_. He looks out for the action required of him.]

[Footnote 10: Note here Hamlet's mood--dominated by his faith. His life
in this world his mother has ruined; he does not care for it a pin: he
is not the less confident of a nature that is immortal. In virtue of
this belief in life, he is indifferent to the form of it. When, later in
the play, he seems to fear death, it is death the consequence of an
action of whose rightness he is not convinced.]

[Footnote 4: The word _artery_, invariably substituted by the editors,
is without authority. In the first Quarto, the word is _Artiue_; in the
second (see margin) _arture_. This latter I take to be the right
one--corrupted into _Artire_ in the Folio. It seems to have troubled the
printers, and possibly the editors. The third Q. has followed the
second; the fourth has _artyre_; the fifth Q. and the fourth F. have
_attire_; the second and third Folios follow the first. Not until the
sixth Q. does _artery_ appear. See _Cambridge Shakespeare. Arture_ was
to all concerned, and to the language itself, a new word. That _artery_
was not Shakspere's intention might be concluded from its unfitness:
what propriety could there be in _making an artery hardy_? The sole,
imperfect justification I was able to think of for such use of the word
arose from the fact that, before the discovery of the circulation of the
blood (published in 1628), it was believed that the arteries (found
empty after death) served for the movements of the animal spirits: this
might vaguely _associate_ the arteries with _courage_. But the sight of
the word _arture_ in the second Quarto at once relieved me.

I do not know if a list has ever been gathered of the words _made_ by
Shakspere: here is one of them--_arture_, from the same root as _artus,
a joint--arcere, to hold together_, adjective _arctus, tight. Arture_,
then, stands for _juncture_. This perfectly fits. In terror the weakest
parts are the joints, for their _artures_ are not _hardy_. 'And you, my
sinews, ... bear me stiffly up.' 55, 56.

Since writing as above, a friend informs me that _arture_ is the exact
equivalent of the [Greek: haphae] of Colossians ii. 19, as interpreted
by Bishop Lightfoot--'the relation between contiguous limbs, not the
parts of the limbs themselves in the neighbourhood of contact,'--for
which relation 'there is no word in our language in common use.']

[Footnote 9: The horror still accumulates. The knowledge of evil--not
evil in the abstract, but evil alive, and all about him--comes darkening
down upon Hamlet's being. Not only is his father an inhabitant of the
nether fires, but he is there by murder.]

[Footnote 1: For the moment he has no doubt that he has seen and spoken
with the ghost of his father.]

[Footnote 2: his head.]

[Footnote 3: The whole speech is that of a student, accustomed to books,
to take notes, and to fix things in his memory. 'Table,' _tablet_.]

[Footnote 4: _wise sayings_.]

[Footnote 5: The Ghost has revealed her adultery: Hamlet suspects her of
complicity in the murder, 168.]

[Footnote 6: It may well seem odd that Hamlet should be represented as,
at such a moment, making a note in his tablets; but without further
allusion to the student-habit, I would remark that, in cases where
strongest passion is roused, the intellect has yet sometimes an
automatic trick of working independently. For instance from Shakspere,
see Constance in _King John_--how, in her agony over the loss of her
son, both her fancy, playing with words, and her imagination, playing
with forms, are busy.

Note the glimpse of Hamlet's character here given: he had been something
of an optimist; at least had known villainy only from books; at thirty
years of age it is to him a discovery that a man may smile and be a
villain! Then think of the shock of such discoveries as are here forced
upon him! Villainy is no longer a mere idea, but a fact! and of all
villainous deeds those of his own mother and uncle are the worst! But
note also his honesty, his justice to humanity, his philosophic
temperament, in the qualification he sets to the memorandum, '--at least
in Denmark!']

[Footnote 7: 'my word,'--the word he has to keep in mind; his cue.]

[Footnote 8: Should not the actor here make a pause, with hand uplifted,
as taking a solemn though silent oath?]

[Footnote 9: --as if calling to a hawk.]

[Footnote 10: Here comes the test of the actor's _possible_: here Hamlet
himself begins to act, and will at once assume a _rôle_, ere yet he well
knows what it must be. One thing only is clear to him--that the
communication of the Ghost is not a thing to be shared--that he must
keep it with all his power of secrecy: the honour both of father and of
mother is at stake. In order to do so, he must begin by putting on
himself a cloak of darkness, and hiding his feelings--first of all the
present agitation which threatens to overpower him. His immediate
impulse or instinctive motion is to force an air, and throw a veil of
grimmest humour over the occurrence. The agitation of the horror at his
heart, ever working and constantly repressed, shows through the veil,
and gives an excited uncertainty to his words, and a wild vacillation to
his manner and behaviour.]

[Footnote 1: He feels his honour touched.]

[Footnote 2: The Ghost's interference heightens Hamlet's agitation. If
he does not talk, laugh, jest, it will overcome him. Also he must not
show that he believes it his father's ghost: that must be kept to
himself--for the present at least. He shows it therefore no
respect--treats the whole thing humorously, so avoiding, or at least
parrying question. It is all he can do to keep the mastery of himself,
dodging horror with half-forced, half-hysterical laughter. Yet is he all
the time intellectually on the alert. See how, instantly active, he
makes use of the voice from beneath to enforce his requisition of
silence. Very speedily too he grows quiet: a glimmer of light as to the
course of action necessary to him has begun to break upon him: it breaks
from his own wild and disjointed behaviour in the attempt to hide the
conflict of his feelings--which suggests to him the idea of shrouding
himself, as did David at the court of the Philistines, in the cloak of
madness: thereby protected from the full force of what suspicion any
absorption of manner or outburst of feeling must occasion, he may win
time to lay his plans. Note how, in the midst of his horror, he is yet
able to think, plan, resolve.]

[Footnote 3: _1st Q. 'The Gost under the stage.'_]

[Footnote 4: While Hamlet seems to take it so coolly, the others have
fled in terror from the spot. He goes to them. Their fear must be what,
on the two occasions after, makes him shift to another place when the
Ghost speaks.]

[Footnote 5: Now at once he consents.]

[Footnote 6: In the _Quarto_ this and the next line are transposed.]

[Footnote 7: What idea is involved as the cause of the Ghost's thus
interfering?--That he too sees what difficulties must encompass the
carrying out of his behest, and what absolute secrecy is thereto
essential.]

[Footnote 8: This idea, hardly yet a resolve, he afterwards carries out
so well, that he deceives not only king and queen and court, but the
most of his critics ever since: to this day they believe him mad. Such
must have studied in the play a phantom of their own misconception, and
can never have seen the Hamlet of Shakspere. Thus prejudiced, they
mistake also the effects of moral and spiritual perturbation and misery
for further sign of intellectual disorder--even for proof of moral
weakness, placing them in the same category with the symptoms of the
insanity which he simulates, and by which they are deluded.]

SUMMARY OF ACT I.


This much of Hamlet we have now learned: he is a thoughtful man, a
genuine student, little acquainted with the world save through books,
and a lover of his kind. His university life at Wittenberg is suddenly
interrupted by a call to the funeral of his father, whom he dearly loves
and honours. Ere he reaches Denmark, his uncle Claudius has contrived,
in an election (202, 250, 272) probably hastened and secretly
influenced, to gain the voice of the representatives at least of the
people, and ascend the throne. Hence his position must have been an
irksome one from the first; but, within a month of his father's death,
his mother's marriage with his uncle--a relation universally regarded as
incestuous--plunges him in the deepest misery. The play introduces him
at the first court held after the wedding. He is attired in the mourning
of his father's funeral, which he had not laid aside for the wedding.
His aspect is of absolute dejection, and he appears in a company for
which he is so unfit only for the sake of desiring permission to leave
the court, and go back to his studies at Wittenberg.[A] Left to himself,
he breaks out in agonized and indignant lamentation over his mother's
conduct, dwelling mainly on her disregard of his father's memory. Her
conduct and his partial discovery of her character, is the sole cause of
his misery. In such his mood, Horatio, a fellow-student, brings him word
that his father's spirit walks at night. He watches for the Ghost, and
receives from him a frightful report of his present condition, into
which, he tells him, he was cast by the murderous hand of his brother,
with whom his wife had been guilty of adultery. He enjoins him to put a
stop to the crime in which they are now living, by taking vengeance on
his uncle. Uncertain at the moment how to act, and dreading the
consequences of rousing suspicion by the perturbation which he could not
but betray, he grasps at the sudden idea of affecting madness. We have
learned also Hamlet's relation to Ophelia, the daughter of the selfish,
prating, busy Polonius, who, with his son Laertes, is destined to work
out the earthly fate of Hamlet. Of Laertes, as yet, we only know that he
prates like his father, is self-confident, and was educated at Paris,
whither he has returned. Of Ophelia we know nothing but that she is
gentle, and that she is fond of Hamlet, whose attentions she has
encouraged, but with whom, upon her father's severe remonstrance, she is
ready, outwardly at least, to break.

ACTUS SECUNDUS.[1]


_Enter Polonius, and Reynoldo._
                 [Sidenote: _Enter old Polonius, with his man, or two._]

_Polon._ Giue him his money, and these notes _Reynoldo_.[2]
                                                  [Sidenote: this money]

_Reynol._ I will my Lord.

_Polon._ You shall doe maruels wisely: good _Reynoldo_,
                                                    [Sidenote: meruiles]
Before you visite him you make inquiry
                                        [Sidenote: him, to make inquire]
Of his behauiour.[3]

_Reynol._ My Lord, I did intend it.

_Polon._ Marry, well said;
Very well said. Looke you Sir,
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
What company, at what expence: and finding
By this encompassement and drift of question,
That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer[4]
Then your particular demands will touch it,
Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
And thus I know his father and his friends,          [Sidenote: As thus]
And in part him. Doe you marke this _Reynoldo_?

_Reynol._ I, very well my Lord.

_Polon._ And in part him, but you may say not well;
But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;
Addicted so and so; and there put on him
What forgeries you please: marry, none so ranke,
As may dishonour him; take heed of that:
But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,
As are Companions noted and most knowne
To youth and liberty.

[Footnote 1: _Not in Quarto._

Between this act and the former, sufficient time has passed to allow the
ambassadors to go to Norway and return: 74. See 138, and what Hamlet
says of the time since his father's death, 24, by which together the
interval _seems_ indicated as about two months, though surely so much
time was not necessary.

Cause and effect _must_ be truly presented; time and space are mere
accidents, and of small consequence in the drama, whose very idea is
compression for the sake of presentation. All that is necessary in
regard to time is, that, either by the act-pause, or the intervention of
a fresh scene, the passing of it should be indicated.

This second act occupies the forenoon of one day.]

[Footnote 2: _1st Q._

    _Montano_, here, these letters to my sonne,
    And this same mony with my blessing to him,
    And bid him ply his learning good _Montano_.]

[Footnote 3: The father has no confidence in the son, and rightly, for
both are unworthy: he turns on him the cunning of the courtier, and
sends a spy on his behaviour. The looseness of his own principles comes
out very clear in his anxieties about his son; and, having learned the
ideas of the father as to what becomes a gentleman, we are not surprised
to find the son such as he afterwards shows himself. Till the end
approaches, we hear no more of Laertes, nor is more necessary; but
without this scene we should have been unprepared for his vileness.]

[Footnote 4: _Point thus_: 'son, come you more nearer; then &c.' The
_then_ here does not stand for _than_, and to change it to _than_ makes
at once a contradiction. The sense is: 'Having put your general
questions first, and been answered to your purpose, then your particular
demands will come in, and be of service; they will reach to the
point--_will touch it_.' The _it_ is impersonal. After it should come a
period.]

[Page 66]

_Reynol._ As gaming my Lord.

_Polon._ I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre.

_Reynol._ My Lord that would dishonour him.

_Polon._ Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;[1]
                                                [Sidenote: Fayth as you]
You must not put another scandall on him,
That hee is open to Incontinencie;[2]
That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,
A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd[3] bloud of generall assault.[4]

_Reynol._ But my good Lord.[5]

_Polon._ Wherefore should you doe this?[6]

_Reynol._ I my Lord, I would know that.

_Polon._ Marry Sir, heere's my drift,
And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:[7]           [Sidenote: of wit,]
You laying these slight sulleyes[8] on my Sonne,
                                                  [Sidenote: sallies[8]]

He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,

_Reynol._ Well, my Lord.        _Exit_.

_Enter Ophelia_.

_Polon_. Farewell:
How now _Ophelia_, what's the matter?

_Ophe_. Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted.
                                         [Sidenote: O my Lord, my Lord,]

_Polon_. With what, in the name of Heauen?
                                           [Sidenote: i'th name of God?]

_Ophe_. My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,     [Sidenote: closset,]
Lord _Hamlet_ with his doublet all vnbrac'd,[5]
No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,
Vngartred, and downe giued[6] to his Anckle,
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
And with a looke so pitious in purport,
As if he had been loosed out of hell,

[Footnote 1: of far reaching mind.]

[Footnote 2: The word windlaces is explained in the dictionaries as
_shifts, subtleties_--but apparently on the sole authority of this
passage. There must be a figure in _windlesses_, as well as in _assaies
of Bias_, which is a phrase plain enough to bowlers: the trying of other
directions than that of the _jack_, in the endeavour to come at one with
the law of the bowl's bias. I find _wanlass_ a term in hunting: it had
to do with driving game to a given point--whether in part by getting to
windward of it, I cannot tell. The word may come of the verb wind, from
its meaning '_to manage by shifts or expedients_': _Barclay_. As he has
spoken of fishing, could the _windlesses_ refer to any little instrument
such as now used upon a fishing-rod? I do not think it. And how do the
words _windlesses_ and _indirections_ come together? Was a windless some
contrivance for determining how the wind blew? I bethink me that a thin
withered straw is in Scotland called a _windlestrae_: perhaps such
straws were thrown up to find out 'by indirection' the direction of the
wind.

The press-reader sends me two valuable quotations, through Latham's
edition of Johnson's Dictionary, from Dr. H. Hammond (1605-1660), in
which _windlass_ is used as a verb:--

'A skilful woodsman, by windlassing, presently gets a shoot, which,
without taking a compass, and thereby a commodious stand, he could never
have obtained.'

'She is not so much at leasure as to windlace, or use craft, to satisfy
them.'

To _windlace_ seems then to mean 'to steal along to leeward;' would it
be absurd to suggest that, so-doing, the hunter _laces the wind_?
Shakspere, with many another, I fancy, speaks of _threading the night_
or _the darkness_.

Johnson explains the word in the text as 'A handle by which anything is
turned.']

[Footnote 3: 'in your selfe.' may mean either 'through the insight
afforded by your own feelings'; or 'in respect of yourself,' 'toward
yourself.' I do not know which is intended.]

[Footnote 4: 1st Q. 'And bid him'.]

[Footnote 5: loose; _undone_.]

[Footnote 6: His stockings, slipped down in wrinkles round his ankles,
suggested the rings of _gyves_ or fetters. The verb _gyve_, of which the
passive participle is here used, is rarer.]

[Page 70]

To speake of horrors: he comes before me.

_Polon._ Mad for thy Loue?

_Ophe._ My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it.[1]

_Polon._ What said he?

_Ophe._[2] He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arme;
And with his other hand thus o're his brow,
He fals to such perusall of my face,
As he would draw it. Long staid he so,                  [Sidenote: As a]
At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;
He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,
That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,            [Sidenote: As it]
And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,
And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,        [Sidenote: shoulder]
He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,
For out adores[3] he went without their helpe;        [Sidenote: helps,]
And to the last, bended their light on me.

_Polon._ Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,   [Sidenote: Come, goe]
This is the very extasie of Loue,
Whose violent property foredoes[4] it selfe,
And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,
As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,                 [Sidenote: passions]
That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,
What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?

_Ophe_. No my good Lord: but as you did command,
[Sidenote: 42, 82] I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
His accesse to me.[5]

_Pol_. That hath made him mad.
I am sorrie that with better speed and Judgement
                                                [Sidenote: better heede]
[Sidenote: 83] I had not quoted[6] him. I feare he did but trifle,
                                           [Sidenote: coted[6] | fear'd]
And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:

[Footnote 1: She would be glad her father should think so.]

[Footnote 2: The detailed description of Hamlet and his behaviour that
follows, must be introduced in order that the side mirror of narrative
may aid the front mirror of drama, and between them be given a true
notion of his condition both mental and bodily. Although weeks have
passed since his interview with the Ghost, he is still haunted with the
memory of it, still broods over its horrible revelation. That he had,
probably soon, begun to feel far from certain of the truth of the
apparition, could not make the thoughts and questions it had awaked,
cease tormenting his whole being. The stifling smoke of his mother's
conduct had in his mind burst into loathsome flame, and through her he
has all but lost his faith in humanity. To know his uncle a villain, was
to know his uncle a villain; to know his mother false, was to doubt
women, doubt the whole world.

In the meantime Ophelia, in obedience to her father, and evidently
without reason assigned, has broken off communication with him: he reads
her behaviour by the lurid light of his mother's. She too is false! she
too is heartless! he can look to her for no help! She has turned against
him to curry favour with his mother and his uncle!

Can she be such as his mother! Why should she not be? His mother had
seemed as good! He would give his life to know her honest and pure.
Might he but believe her what he had believed her, he would yet have a
hiding-place from the wind, a covert from the tempest! If he could but
know the truth! Alone with her once more but for a moment, he would read
her very soul by the might of his! He must see her! He would see her! In
the agony of a doubt upon which seemed to hang the bliss or bale of his
being, yet not altogether unintimidated by a sense of his intrusion, he
walks into the house of Polonius, and into the chamber of Ophelia.

Ever since the night of the apparition, the court, from the behaviour
assumed by Hamlet, has believed his mind affected; and when he enters
her room, Ophelia, though such is the insight of love that she is able
to read in the face of the son the father's purgatorial sufferings, the
picture of one 'loosed out of hell, to speak of horrors,' attributes all
the strangeness of his appearance and demeanour, such as she describes
them to her father, to that supposed fact. But there is, in truth, as
little of affected as of actual madness in his behaviour in her
presence. When he comes before her pale and trembling, speechless and
with staring eyes, it is with no simulated insanity, but in the agonized
hope, scarce distinguishable from despair, of finding, in the testimony
of her visible presence, an assurance that the doubts ever tearing his
spirit and sickening his brain, are but the offspring of his phantasy.
There she sits!--and there he stands, vainly endeavouring through her
eyes to read her soul! for, alas,

                    there's no art
    To find the mind's construction in the face!

--until at length, finding himself utterly baffled, but unable, save by
the removal of his person, to take his eyes from her face, he retires
speechless as he came. Such is the man whom we are now to see wandering
about the halls and corridors of the great castle-palace.

He may by this time have begun to doubt even the reality of the sight he
had seen. The moment the pressure of a marvellous presence is removed,
it is in the nature of man the same moment to begin to doubt; and
instead of having any reason to wish the apparition a true one, he had
every reason to desire to believe it an illusion or a lying spirit.
Great were his excuse even if he forced likelihoods, and suborned
witnesses in the court of his own judgment. To conclude it false was to
think his father in heaven, and his mother not an adulteress, not a
murderess! At once to kill his uncle would be to seal these horrible
things irrevocable, indisputable facts. Strongest reasons he had for not
taking immediate action in vengeance; but no smallest incapacity for
action had share in his delay. The Poet takes recurrent pains, as if he
foresaw hasty conclusions, to show his hero a man of promptitude, with
this truest fitness for action, that he would not make unlawful haste.
Without sufficing assurance, he would have no part in the fate either of
the uncle he disliked or the mother he loved.]

We have here a curious instance of Shakspere's not unfrequently
excessive condensation. Expanded, the clause would be like this: 'which,
being kept close, might move more grief by the hiding of love, than to
utter love might move hate:' the grief in the one case might be greater
than the hate in the other would be. It verges on confusion, and may not
be as Shakspere wrote it, though it is like his way.

[Footnote 11: 'to gather as much as you may glean from opportunities, of
that which, when disclosed to us, will lie within our remedial power.'
If the line of the Quarto be included, it makes plainer construction.
The line beginning with '_So much_,' then becomes parenthetical, and _to
gather_ will not immediately govern that line, but the rest of the
sentence.]

comma, the content of the phrase would be general:--'in the devoted
force of our faculty.' The latter is more like Shakspere.]

means, '_I hold my duty precious as my soul, whether to my God or my
king_'; if the _F.'s_, it is a little confused by the attempt of
Polonius to make a fine euphuistic speech:--'_I hold my duty as I hold
my soul,--both at the command of my God, one at the command of my
king_.']

meaning is plain enough, though logical form is wanting.]

[Footnote 6: As there is no imagination in Polonius, we cannot look for
great aptitude in figure.]

[Footnote 7: The nature of madness also is a postulate.]

[Footnote 8: She is impatient, but wraps her rebuke in a compliment.
Art, so-called, in speech, was much favoured in the time of Elizabeth.
And as a compliment Polonius takes the form in which she expresses her
dislike of his tediousness, and her anxiety after his news: pretending
to wave it off, he yet, in his gratification, coming on the top of his
excitement with the importance of his fancied discovery, plunges
immediately into a very slough of _art_, and becomes absolutely silly.]

[Footnote 9: It is no figure at all. It is hardly even a play with the
words.]

That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified

excellent white bosome, these.[2]                  [Sidenote: these, &c]

_Qu_. Came this from _Hamlet_ to her.

_Pol_. Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.

thee best, oh most Best beleeue it. Adieu.
          Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this
                  Machine is to him_, Hamlet.

All giuen to mine eare.

_King_. But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?

_Pol_. What do you thinke of me?

_King_. As of a man, faithfull and Honourable.

_Pol_. I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?

[Footnote 1: _Not in Quarto._]

[Footnote 2: _Point thus_: 'but you shall heare. _These, in her
excellent white bosom, these_:'

Ladies, we are informed, wore a small pocket in front of the
bodice;--but to accept the fact as an explanation of this passage, is to
cast the passage away. Hamlet _addresses_ his letter, not to Ophelia's
pocket, but to Ophelia herself, at her house--that is, in the palace of
her bosom, excellent in whiteness. In like manner, signing himself, he
makes mention of his body as a machine of which he has the use for a
time. So earnest is Hamlet that when he makes love, he is the more a
philosopher. But he is more than a philosopher: he is a man of the
Universe, not a man of this world only.

We must not allow the fashion of the time in which the play was written,
to cause doubt as to the genuine heartiness of Hamlet's love-making.]

[Footnote 3: _1st Q._

When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,
As I perceiued it, I must tell you that
Before my Daughter told me, what might you

If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,[1]
Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,         [Sidenote: working]
Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,[2]
What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,
And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake[3]

act: he attributes his interference to his care for what befitted
royalty; whereas, talking to Ophelia (40, 72), he attributes it entirely
to his care for her;--so partly in the speech correspondent to the
present in _1st Q_.:--

[Footnote 7: Now first the Play shows us Hamlet in his affected madness.
He has a great dislike to the selfish, time-serving courtier, who, like
his mother, has forsaken the memory of his father--and a great distrust
of him as well. The two men are moral antipodes. Each is given to
moralizing--but compare their reflections: those of Polonius reveal a
lover of himself, those of Hamlet a lover of his kind; Polonius is
interested in success; Hamlet in humanity.]

[Footnote 8: So also in _1st Q_.]

[Footnote 9: --reading, or pretending to read, the words from the book
he carries.]

[Footnote 10: When the passion for emendation takes possession of a man,
his opportunities are endless--so many seeming emendations offer
themselves which are in themselves not bad, letters and words affording
as much play as the keys of a piano. 'Being a god kissing carrion,' is
in itself good enough; but Shakspere meant what stands in both Quarto
and Folio: _the dead dog being a carrion good at kissing_. The arbitrary
changes of the editors are amazing.]

[Footnote 11: He cannot help his mind constantly turning upon women; and
if his thoughts of them are often cruelly false, it is not Hamlet but
his mother who is to blame: her conduct has hurled him from the peak of
optimism into the bottomless pool of pessimistic doubt, above the foul
waters of which he keeps struggling to lift his head.]

_Ham_. Let her not walke i'th'Sunne: Conception[1]

[Sidenote: 100] _Pol_.[2] How say you by that? Still harping on

_Pol_.[5] Though this be madnesse,
Yet there is Method in't: will you walke
Out of the ayre[6] my Lord?

and my daughter.[6] My Lord, I will take my leaue of you.]

[Footnote 1: From 'And sodainely' _to_ 'betweene him,' _not in Quarto_.]

[Footnote 2: It is well here to recall the modes of the word _leave_:
'_Give me leave_,' Polonius says with proper politeness to the king and
queen when he wants _them_ to go--that is, 'Grant me your _departure_';
but he would, going himself, _take_ his leave, his departure, _of_ or
_from_ them--by their permission to go. Hamlet means, 'You cannot take
from me anything I will more willingly part with than your leave, or, my
permission to you to go.' 85, 203. See the play on the two meanings of
the word in _Twelfth Night_, act ii. sc. 4:

    _Duke_. Give me now leave to leave thee;

though I suspect it ought to be--

    _Duke_. Give me now leave.

    _Clown_. To leave thee!--Now, the melancholy &c.]

[Footnote 3: It is a relief to him to speak the truth under the cloak of
madness--ravingly. He has no one to whom to open his heart: what lies
there he feels too terrible for even the eye of Horatio. He has not
apparently told him as yet more than the tale of his father's murder.]

[Footnote 4: _Above, in Quarto_.]

[Footnote 5: In this and all like utterances of Hamlet, we see what worm
it is that lies gnawing at his heart.]

his daughter was not present.]

newes is not true.[1] [2] Let me question more in particular:
what haue you my good friends, deserued
at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to
Prison hither?

_Guil_. Prison, my Lord?

_Ham_. Denmark's a Prison.

_Rosin_. Then is the World one.

_Ham_. A goodly one, in which there are many
Confines, Wards, and Dungeons; _Denmarke_ being
one o'th'worst.

_Rosin_. We thinke not so my Lord.

_Ham_. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is
nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it
so[3]: to me it is a prison.

_Rosin_. Why then your Ambition makes it one:
'tis too narrow for your minde.[4]

_Ham_. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell,
and count my selfe a King of infinite space; were
it not that I haue bad dreames.

_Guil_. Which dreames indeed are Ambition:
for the very substance[5] of the Ambitious, is meerely
the shadow of a Dreame.

_Ham_. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow.

_Rosin_. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry
and light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow.

_Ham_. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our
Monarchs and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers
Shadowes: shall wee to th'Court: for, by my fey[6]
I cannot reason?[7]

_Both_. Wee'l wait vpon you.

_Ham_. No such matter.[8] I will not sort you
with the rest of my seruants: for to speake to you
like an honest man: I am most dreadfully attended;[9]
but in the beaten way of friendship,[10]              [Sidenote: But in]

[Footnote 1: 'it is not true that the world is grown honest': he doubts
themselves. His eye is sharper because his heart is sorer since he left
Wittenberg. He proceeds to examine them.]

[Footnote 2: This passage, beginning with 'Let me question,' and ending
with 'dreadfully attended,' is not in the _Quarto_.

Who inserted in the Folio this and other passages? Was it or was it not
Shakspere? Beyond a doubt they are Shakspere's all. Then who omitted
those omitted? Was Shakspere incapable of refusing any of his own work?
Or would these editors, who profess to have all opportunity, and who,
belonging to the theatre, must have had the best of opportunities, have
desired or dared to omit what far more painstaking editors have since
presumed, though out of reverence, to restore?]

[Footnote 3: 'but it is thinking that makes it so:']

[Footnote 4: --feeling after the cause of Hamlet's strangeness, and
following the readiest suggestion, that of chagrin at missing the
succession.]

[Footnote 5: objects and aims.]

[Footnote 6: _foi_.]

[Footnote 7: Does he choose beggars as the representatives of substance
because they lack ambition--that being shadow? Or does he take them as
the shadows of humanity, that, following Rosincrance, he may get their
shadows, the shadows therefore of shadows, to parallel _monarchs_ and
_heroes_? But he is not satisfied with his own analogue--therefore will
to the court, where good logic is not wanted--where indeed he knows a
hellish lack of reason.]

[Footnote 8: 'On no account.']

[Footnote 9: 'I have very bad servants.' Perhaps he judges his servants
spies upon him. Or might he mean that he was _haunted with bad
thoughts_? Or again, is it a stroke of his pretence of
madness--suggesting imaginary followers?]

_Rosin_. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion.

_Ham_. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in    [Sidenote: am ever poore]

my thanks are too deare a halfepeny[1]; were you
[Sidenote: 72] not sent for? Is it your owne inclining? Is it a
free visitation?[2] Come, deale iustly with me:
come, come; nay speake.                          [Sidenote: come, come,]

you were sent for; and there is a kinde confession

craft enough to color, I know the good King and
[Sidenote: 72] Queene haue sent for you.

_Rosin_. To what end my Lord?

_Ham_. That you must teach me: but let mee
coniure[4] you by the rights of our fellowship, by
the consonancy of our youth,[5] by the Obligation
of our euer-preserued loue, and by what more
deare, a better proposer could charge you withall;       [Sidenote: can]
be euen and direct with me, whether you were sent
for or no.

_Rosin_. What say you?[6]

_Ham_. Nay then I haue an eye of you[7]: if you
loue me hold not off.[8]

[Sidenote: 72] _Guil_. My Lord, we were sent for.

in Man, what Lenton entertainment the Players
shall receiue from you:[3] wee coated them[4] on the
way, and hither are they comming to offer you
Seruice.

his Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee:                [Sidenote: on me,]
the aduenturous Knight shal vse his Foyle and
Target: the Louer shall not sigh _gratis_, the
humorous man[6] shall end his part in peace: [7] the
Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs are
tickled a'th' sere:[8] and the Lady shall say her
minde freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't[9]:

what Players are they?

_Rosin._ Euen those you Were wont to take

_Ham._ How chances it they trauaile? their residence
both in reputation and profit was better both
wayes.

_Rosin._ I thinke their Inhibition comes by the
meanes of the late Innouation?[10]

[Footnote 1: A genuine description, so far as it goes, of the state of
Hamlet's mind. But he does not reveal the operating cause--his loss of
faith in women, which has taken the whole poetic element out of heaven,
earth, and humanity: he would have his uncle's spies attribute his
condition to mere melancholy.]

[Footnote 3: --a ready-witted subterfuge.]

[Footnote 4: came alongside of them; got up with them; apparently rather
from Fr. _côté_ than _coter_; like _accost_. Compare 71. But I suspect
it only means _noted_, _observed_, and is from _coter_.]

characters_.]

[Footnote 6: --the man with a whim.]

[Footnote 7: This part of the speech--from [7] to [8], is not in the
_Quarto_.]

[Footnote 8: Halliwell gives a quotation in which the touch-hole of a
pistol is called the _sere_: the _sere_, then, of the lungs would mean
the opening of the lungs--the part with which we laugh: those 'whose
lungs are tickled a' th' sere,' are such as are ready to laugh on the
least provocation: _tickled_--_irritable, ticklish_--ready to laugh, as
another might be to cough. 'Tickled o' the sere' was a common phrase,
signifying, thus, _propense_.

    _1st Q._ The clowne shall make them laugh
    That are tickled in the lungs,]

[Footnote 9: Does this refer to the pause that expresses the
unutterable? or to the ruin of the measure of the verse by an
incompetent heroine?]

[Footnote 10: Does this mean, 'I think their prohibition comes through
the late innovation,'--of the children's acting; or, 'I think they are
prevented from staying at home by the late new measures,'--such, namely,
as came of the puritan opposition to stage-plays? This had grown so
strong, that, in 1600, the Privy Council issued an order restricting the
number of theatres in London to two: by such an _innovation_ a number of
players might well be driven to the country.]

_Ham_. Doe they hold the same estimation they
did when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?

_Rosin_. No indeed, they are not.              [Sidenote: are they not.]

[1]_Ham_. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?

_Rosin_. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the
wonted pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children,[2]
little Yases,[3] that crye out[4] on the top of question;[5]
and are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are
now the fashion, and so be-ratled the common
Stages[6] (so they call them) that many wearing
Rapiers,[7] are affraide of Goose-quils, and dare
scarse come thither.[8]

_Ham_. What are they Children? Who maintains
'em? How are they escoted?[9] Will they pursue
the Quality[10] no longer then they can sing?[11] Will
they not say afterwards if they should grow themselues
to common Players (as it is like most[12] if
their meanes are no better) their Writers[13] do them
wrong, to make them exclaim against their owne
Succession.[14]

_Rosin_. Faith there ha's bene much to do on
both sides: and the Nation holds it no sinne, to
tarre them[15] to Controuersie. There was for a
while, no mony bid for argument, vnlesse the Poet
and the Player went to Cuffes in the Question.[16]

_Ham_. Is't possible?

_Guild_. Oh there ha's beene much throwing
about of Braines.

_Ham_. Do the Boyes carry it away?[17]

_Rosin_. I that they do my Lord, _Hercules_ and
his load too.[18]

instance adduced, no change in social fashion--nothing at all indeed, is
to be wondered at, I fail to see it. Perhaps the speech is intended to
belong to the simulation. The last sentence of it appears meant to
convey the impression that he suspects nothing--is only bewildered by
the course of things.]

[Footnote 7: He seems to desire that they shall no more be on the
footing of fellow-students, and thus to rid himself of the old relation.
Perhaps he hints that they are players too. From any further show of
friendliness he takes refuge in convention--and professed
convention--supplying a reason in order to escape a dangerous
interpretation of his sudden formality--'lest you should suppose me more
cordial to the players than to you.' The speech is full of inwoven
irony, doubtful, and refusing to be ravelled out. With what merely
half-shown, yet scathing satire it should be spoken and accompanied!]

[Footnote 8: A proverb of the time comically corrupted--_handsaw for
hernshaw_--a heron, the quarry of the hawk. He denies his madness as
madmen do--and in terms themselves not unbefitting madness--so making it
seem the more genuine. Yet every now and then, urged by the commotion of
his being, he treads perilously on the border of self-betrayal.]

[Footnote 10: _Point thus_: 'Mark it.--You say right, sir; &c.' He takes
up a speech that means nothing, and might mean anything, to turn aside
the suspicion their whispering might suggest to Polonius that they had
been talking about him--so better to lay his trap for him.]

[Footnote 11: He mentions the _actor_ to lead Polonius so that his
prophecy of him shall come true.]

[Footnote 12: An interjection of mockery: he had made a fool of him.]

Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,[11]

A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting        [Sidenote: an his]
With Formes, to his Conceit?[13] And all for nothing?

[Footnote 1: Why do the editors choose the present tense of the
_Quarto_? Hamlet does not mean, 'It is worse to have the ill report of
the Players while you live, than a bad epitaph after your death.' The
order of the sentence has provided against that meaning. What he means
is, that their ill report in life will be more against your reputation
after death than a bad epitaph.]

[Footnote 2: _Not in Quarto_.]

[Footnote 3: He detains their leader.]

[Footnote 4: 'for a special reason'.]

[Footnote 5: _Study_ is still the Player's word for _commit to memory_.]

[Footnote 6: Note Hamlet's quick resolve, made clearer towards the end
of the following soliloquy.]

[Footnote 7: Polonius is waiting at the door: this is intended for his
hearing.]

    Why what a dunghill idiote slaue am I?
    Why these Players here draw water from eyes:
    For Hecuba, why what is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?]

[Footnote 11: Everything rings on the one hard, fixed idea that
possesses him; but this one idea has many sides. Of late he has been
thinking more upon the woman-side of it; but the Player with his speech
has brought his father to his memory, and he feels he has been
forgetting him: the rage of the actor recalls his own 'cue for passion.'
Always more ready to blame than justify himself, he feels as if he ought
to have done more, and so falls to abusing himself.]

[Footnote 12: _imagination_.]

[Footnote 13: 'his whole operative nature providing fit forms for the
embodiment of his imagined idea'--of which forms he has already
mentioned his _warmed visage_, his _tears_, his _distracted look_, his
_broken voice_.

In this passage we have the true idea of the operation of the genuine
_acting faculty_. Actor as well as dramatist, the Poet gives us here his

SUMMARY.


The division between the second and third acts is by common consent
placed here. The third act occupies the afternoon, evening, and night of
the same day with the second.

This soliloquy is Hamlet's first, and perhaps we may find it correct to
say _only_ outbreak of self-accusation. He charges himself with lack of
feeling, spirit, and courage, in that he has not yet taken vengeance on
his uncle. But unless we are prepared to accept and justify to the full
his own hardest words against himself, and grant him a muddy-mettled,
pigeon-livered rascal, we must examine and understand him, so as to
account for his conduct better than he could himself. If we allow that
perhaps he accuses himself too much, we may find on reflection that he
accuses himself altogether wrongfully. If a man is content to think the
worst of Hamlet, I care to hold no argument with that man.

We must not look for _expressed_ logical sequence in a soliloquy, which
is a vocal mind. The mind is seldom conscious of the links or
transitions of a yet perfectly logical process developed in it. This
remark, however, is more necessary in regard to the famous soliloquy to
follow.

In Hamlet, misery has partly choked even vengeance; and although sure in
his heart that his uncle is guilty, in his brain he is not sure.
Bitterly accusing himself in an access of wretchedness and rage and
credence, he forgets the doubt that has restrained him, with all besides
which he might so well urge in righteous defence, not excuse, of his
delay. But ungenerous criticism has, by all but universal consent,
accepted his own verdict against himself. So in common life there are
thousands on thousands who, upon the sad confession of a man
immeasurably greater than themselves, and showing his greatness in the
humility whose absence makes admission impossible to them, immediately
pounce upon him with vituperation, as if he were one of the vile, and
they infinitely better. Such should be indignant with St. Paul and
say--if he was the chief of sinners, what insolence to lecture _them_!
and certainly the more justified publican would never by them have been
allowed to touch the robe of the less justified Pharisee. Such critics
surely take little or no pains to understand the object of their
contempt: because Hamlet is troubled and blames himself, they without
hesitation condemn him--and there where he is most commendable. It is
the righteous man who is most ready to accuse himself; the unrighteous
is least ready. Who is able when in deep trouble, rightly to analyze his
feelings? Delay in action is not necessarily abandonment of duty; in
Hamlet's case it is a due recognition of duty, which condemns
precipitancy--and action in the face of doubt, so long as it is nowise
compelled, is precipitancy. The first thing is _to be sure_: Hamlet has
never been sure; he spies at length a chance of making himself sure; he
seizes upon it; and while his sudden resolve to make use of the players,
like the equally sudden resolve to shroud himself in pretended madness,
manifests him fertile in expedient, the carrying out of both manifests
him right capable and diligent in execution--_a man of action in every
true sense of the word_.

The self-accusation of Hamlet has its ground in the lapse of weeks
during which nothing has been done towards punishing the king. Suddenly
roused to a keen sense of the fact, he feels as if surely he might have
done something. The first act ends with a burning vow of righteous
vengeance; the second shows him wandering about the palace in
profoundest melancholy--such as makes it more than easy for him to
assume the forms of madness the moment he marks any curious eye bent
upon him. Let him who has never loved and revered a mother, call such
melancholy weakness. He has indeed done nothing towards the fulfilment
of his vow; but the way in which he made the vow, the terms in which he
exacted from his companions their promise of silence, and his scheme for
eluding suspicion, combine to show that from the first he perceived its
fulfilment would be hard, saw the obstacles in his way, and knew it
would require both time and caution. That even in the first rush of his
wrath he should thus be aware of difficulty, indicates moral symmetry;
but the full weight of what lay in his path could appear to him only
upon reflection. Partly in the light of passages yet to come, I will
imagine the further course of his thoughts, which the closing couplet of
the first act shows as having already begun to apale 'the native hue of
resolution.'

'But how shall I take vengeance on my uncle? Shall I publicly accuse
him, or slay him at once? In the one case what answer can I make to his
denial? in the other, what justification can I offer? If I say the
spirit of my father accuses him, what proof can I bring? My companions
only saw the apparition--heard no word from him; and my uncle's party
will assert, with absolute likelihood to the minds of those who do not
know me--and who here knows me but my mother!--that charge is a mere
coinage of jealous disappointment, working upon the melancholy I have
not cared to hide. (174-6.) When I act, it must be to kill him, and to
what misconstruction shall I not expose myself! (272) If the thing must
so be, I must brave all; but I could never present myself thereafter as
successor to the crown of one whom I had first slain and then vilified
on the accusation of an apparition whom no one heard but myself! I must
find _proof_--such proof as will satisfy others as well as myself. My
immediate duty is _evidence_, not vengeance.'

We have seen besides, that, when informed of the haunting presence of
the Ghost, he expected the apparition with not a little doubt as to its
authenticity--a doubt which, even when he saw it, did not immediately
vanish: is it any wonder that when the apparition was gone, the doubt
should return? Return it did, in accordance with the reaction which
waits upon all high-strung experience. If he did not believe in the
person who performed it, would any man long believe in any miracle?
Hamlet soon begins to question whether he can with confidence accept the
appearance for that which it appeared and asserted itself to be. He
steps over to the stand-point of his judges, and doubts the only
testimony he has to produce. Far more:--was he not bound in common
humanity, not to say _filialness_, to doubt it? To doubt the Ghost, was
to doubt a testimony which to accept was to believe his father in
horrible suffering, his uncle a murderer, his mother at least an
adulteress; to kill his uncle was to set his seal to the whole, and,
besides, to bring his mother into frightful suspicion of complicity in
his father's murder. Ought not the faintest shadow of a doubt, assuaging
ever so little the glare of the hell-sun of such crime, to be welcome to
the tortured heart? Wretched wife and woman as his mother had shown
herself, the Ghost would have him think her far worse--perhaps, even
accessory to her husband's murder! For action he _must_ have proof!

At the same time, what every one knew of his mother, coupled now with
the mere idea of the Ghost's accusation, wrought in him such misery,
roused in him so many torturing and unanswerable questions, so blotted
the face of the universe and withered the heart of hope, that he could
not but doubt whether, in such a world of rogues and false women, it was
worth his while to slay one villain out of the swarm.

Ophelia's behaviour to him, in obedience to her father, of which she
gives him no explanation, has added 'the pangs of disprized love,' and
increased his doubts of woman-kind. 120.

But when his imagination, presenting afresh the awful interview, brings
him more immediately under the influence of the apparition and its
behest, he is for the moment delivered both from the stunning effect of
its communication and his doubt of its truth; forgetting then the
considerations that have wrought in him, he accuses himself of
remissness, blames himself grievously for his delay. Soon, however, his
senses resume their influence, and he doubts again. So goes the
mill-round of his thoughts, with the revolving of many wheels.

His whole conscious nature is frightfully shaken: he would be the poor
creature most of his critics would make of him, were it otherwise; it is
because of his greatness that he suffers so terribly, and doubts so
much. A mother's crime is far more paralyzing than a father's murder is
stimulating; and either he has not set himself in thorough earnest to
find the proof he needs, or he has as yet been unable to think of any
serviceable means to the end, when the half real, half simulated emotion
of the Player yet again rouses in him the sense of remissness, leads him
to accuse himself of forgotten obligation and heartlessness, and
simultaneously suggests a device for putting the Ghost and his words to
the test. Instantly he seizes the chance: when a thing has to be done,
and can be done, Hamlet is _never_ wanting--shows himself the very
promptest of men.

In the last passage of this act I do not take it that he is expressing
an idea then first occurring to him: that the whole thing may be a snare
of the devil is a doubt with which during weeks he has been familiar.

The delay through which, in utter failure to comprehend his character,
he has been so miserably misjudged, falls really between the first and
second acts, although it seems in the regard of most readers to underlie
and protract the whole play. Its duration is measured by the journey of
the ambassadors to and from the neighbouring kingdom of Norway.

It is notably odd, by the way, that those who accuse Hamlet of inaction,
are mostly the same who believe his madness a reality! In truth,
however, his affected madness is one of the strongest signs of his
activity, and his delay one of the strongest proofs of his sanity.

This second act, the third act, and a part always given to the fourth,
but which really belongs to the third, occupy in all only one day.

[Footnote 7: Here is one element in the very existence of the preceding
act: doubt as to the facts of the case has been throughout operating to
restrain him; and here first he reveals, perhaps first recognizes its
influence. Subject to change of feeling with the wavering of conviction,
he now for a moment regards his uncertainty as involving unnatural
distrust of a being in whose presence he cannot help _feeling_ him his
father. He was familiar with the lore of the supernatural, and knew the
doubt he expresses to be not without support.--His companions as well
had all been in suspense as to the identity of the apparition with the
late king.]

suggest the queen's going up to Ophelia, to show how we may easily hold
Ophelia ignorant of their plot. Poor creature as she was, I would
believe Shakspere did not mean her to lie to Hamlet. This may be why he
omitted that part of her father's speech in the _1st Q._ given in the
note immediately above, telling her the king is going to hide. Still, it
would be excuse enough for _her_, that she thought his madness justified
the deception.]

associates. How could he even glance at the things he has just
mentioned, as each, a reason for suicide? It were a cowardly country
indeed where the question might be asked, 'Who would not commit suicide
because of any one of these things, except on account of what may follow
after death?'! One might well, however, be tempted to destroy an
oppressor, _and risk his life in that._]

would hardly call turning from _suicide_ cowardice in any sense. 24.]

[Footnote 1: How could _suicide_ be styled _an enterprise of great
pith_? Yet less could it be called _of great pitch_.]

[Footnote 2: I allow this to be a general reflection, but surely it
serves to show that _conscience_ must at least be one of Hamlet's
restraints.]

[Footnote 3: --by way of intercession.]

[Footnote 4: Note the entire change of mood from that of the last
soliloquy. The right understanding of this soliloquy is indispensable to
the right understanding of Hamlet. But we are terribly trammelled and
hindered, as in the understanding of Hamlet throughout, so here in the
understanding of his meditation, by traditional assumption. I was roused
to think in the right direction concerning it, by the honoured friend
and relative to whom I have feebly acknowledged my obligation by
dedicating to him this book. I could not at first see it as he saw it:
'Think about it, and you will,' he said. I did think, and by
degrees--not very quickly--my prejudgments thinned, faded, and almost
vanished. I trust I see it now as a whole, and in its true relations,
internal and external--its relations to itself, to the play, and to the
Hamlet, of Shakspere.

Neither in its first verse, then, nor in it anywhere else, do I find
even an allusion to suicide. What Hamlet is referring to in the said
first verse, it is not possible with certainty to determine, for it is
but the vanishing ripple of a preceding ocean of thought, from which he
is just stepping out upon the shore of the articulate. He may have been
plunged in some profound depth of the metaphysics of existence, or he
may have been occupied with the one practical question, that of the
slaying of his uncle, which has, now in one form, now in another,
haunted his spirit for weeks. Perhaps, from the message he has just
received, he expects to meet the king, and conscience, confronting
temptation, has been urging the necessity of proof; perhaps a righteous
consideration of consequences, which sometimes have share in the primary
duty, has been making him shrink afresh from the shedding of blood, for
every thoughtful mind recoils from the irrevocable, and that is an awful
form of the irrevocable. But whatever thought, general or special, this
first verse may be dismissing, we come at once thereafter into the light
of a definite question: 'Which is nobler--to endure evil fortune, or to
oppose it _à outrance_; to bear in passivity, or to resist where
resistance is hopeless--resist to the last--to the death which is its
unavoidable end?'

Then comes a pause, during which he is thinking--we will not say 'too
precisely on the event,' but taking his account with consequences: the
result appears in the uttered conviction that the extreme possible
consequence, death, is a good and not an evil. Throughout, observe, how
here, as always, he generalizes, himself being to himself but the type
of his race.

Then follows another pause, during which he seems prosecuting the
thought, for he has already commenced further remark in similar strain,
when suddenly a new and awful element introduces itself:

                       ....To die--to sleep.--
    --To _sleep_! perchance to _dream_!

He had been thinking of death only as the passing away of the present
with its troubles; here comes the recollection that death has its own
troubles--its own thoughts, its own consciousness: if it be a sleep, it
has its dreams. '_What dreams may come_' means, 'the sort of dreams that
may come'; the emphasis is on the _what_, not on the _may_; there is no
question whether dreams will come, but there is question of the
character of the dreams. This consideration is what makes calamity so
long-lived! 'For who would bear the multiform ills of life'--he alludes
to his own wrongs, but mingles, in his generalizing way, others of those
most common to humanity, and refers to the special cure for some of his
own which was close to his hand--'who would bear these things if he
could, as I can, make his quietus with a bare bodkin'--that is, by
slaying his enemy--'who would then bear them, but that he fears the
future, and the divine judgment upon his life and actions--that
conscience makes a coward of him!'[14]

To run, not the risk of death, but the risks that attend upon and follow
death, Hamlet must be certain of what he is about; he must be sure it is
a right thing he does, or he will leave it undone. Compare his speech,
250, 'Does it not, &c.':--by the time he speaks this speech, he has had
perfect proof, and asserts the righteousness of taking vengeance in
almost an agony of appeal to Horatio.

The more continuous and the more formally logical a soliloquy, the less
natural it is. The logic should be all there, but latent; the bones of
it should not show: they do not show here.]

[Footnote 5: _One_ 'well' _only in Q._]

[Footnote 6: He does not want to take them back, and so sever even that
weak bond between them. He has not given her up.]

[Footnote 7: The _Q._ reading seems best. The perfume of his gifts was
the sweet words with which they were given; those words having lost
their savour, the mere gifts were worth nothing.]

[Footnote 8: Released from the commands her father had laid upon her,
and emboldened by the queen's approval of more than the old relation
between them, she would timidly draw Hamlet back to the past--to love
and a sound mind.]

[Footnote 9: I do not here suppose a noise or movement of the arras, or
think that the talk from this point bears the mark of the madness he
would have assumed on the least suspicion of espial. His distrust of
Ophelia comes from a far deeper source--suspicion of all women, grown
doubtful to him through his mother. Hopeless for her, he would give his
life to know that Ophelia was not like her. Hence the cruel things he
says to her here and elsewhere; they are the brood of a heart haunted
with horrible, alas! too excusable phantoms of distrust. A man wretched
as Hamlet must be forgiven for being rude; it is love suppressed, love
that can neither breathe nor burn, that makes him rude. His horrid
insinuations are a hungry challenge to indignant rejection. He would
sting Ophelia to defence of herself and her sex. But, either from her
love, or from gentleness to his supposed madness, as afterwards in the
play-scene, or from the poverty and weakness of a nature so fathered and
so brothered, she hears, and says nothing. 139.]

[Footnote 10: Honesty is here figured as a porter,--just after, as a
porter that may be corrupted.]

[Footnote 11: If the _Folio_ reading is right, _commerce_ means
_companionship_; if the _Quarto_ reading, then it means _intercourse_.
Note _then_ constantly for our _than_.]

[Footnote 12: I imagine Ophelia here giving Hamlet a loving look--which
hardens him. But I do not think she lays emphasis on _your_; the word is
here, I take it, used (as so often then) impersonally.]

[Footnote 13: '--proof in you and me: _I_ loved _you_ once, but my
honesty did not translate your beauty into its likeness.']

[Footnote 14: That the Great Judgement was here in Shakspere's thought,
will be plain to those who take light from the corresponding passage in
the _1st Quarto_. As it makes an excellent specimen of that issue in the
character I am most inclined to attribute to it--that of original sketch
and continuous line of notes, with more or less finished passages in
place among the notes--I will here quote it, recommending it to my
student's attention. If it be what I suggest, it is clear that Shakspere
had not at first altogether determined how he would carry the
soliloquy--what line he was going to follow in it: here hope and fear
contend for the place of motive to patience. The changes from it in the
text are well worth noting: the religion is lessened: the hope
disappears: were they too much of pearls to cast before 'barren
spectators'? The manuscript could never have been meant for any eye but
his own, seeing it was possible to print from it such a chaos--over
which yet broods the presence of the formative spirit of the Poet.

part by a feeling, taught by his mother's, of how imperfect it was.]

[Footnote 5: tolerably.]

[Footnote 6: He turns from baiting woman in her to condemn himself. Is
it not the case with every noble nature, that the knowledge of wrong in
another arouses in it the consciousness of its own faults and sins, of
its own evil possibilities? Hurled from the heights of ideal humanity,
Hamlet not only recognizes in himself every evil tendency of his race,
but almost feels himself individually guilty of every transgression.
'God, God, forgive us all!' exclaims the doctor who has just witnessed
the misery of Lady Macbeth, unveiling her guilt.

This whole speech of Hamlet is profoundly sane--looking therefore
altogether insane to the shallow mind, on which the impression of its
insanity is deepened by its coming from him so freely. The common nature
disappointed rails at humanity; Hamlet, his earthly ideal destroyed,
would tear his individual human self to pieces.]

statement for correct, and says this in the hope that Polonius is not

heard without difficulty.]

[Footnote 7: To know a man, there is scarce a readier way than to hear
him talk of his friend--why he loves, admires, chooses him. The Poet
here gives us a wide window into Hamlet. So genuine is his respect for
_being_, so indifferent is he to _having_, that he does not shrink, in
argument for his own truth, from reminding his friend to his face that,
being a poor man, nothing is to be gained from him--nay, from telling
him that it is through his poverty he has learned to admire him, as a
man of courage, temper, contentment, and independence, with nothing but
his good spirits for an income--a man whose manhood is dominant both
over his senses and over his fortune--a true Stoic. He describes an
ideal man, then clasps the ideal to his bosom as his own, in the person
of his friend. Only a great man could so worship another, choosing him
for such qualities; and hereby Shakspere shows us his Hamlet--a brave,
noble, wise, pure man, beset by circumstances the most adverse
conceivable. That Hamlet had not misapprehended Horatio becomes evident
in the last scene of all. 272.]

_Ham._ Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish:

Capons so.[9]

_King._ I haue nothing with this answer _Hamlet_,
these words are not mine.[10]

_Ham._ No, nor mine. Now[11] my Lord, you
plaid once i'th'Vniuersity, you say?

_Polon._ That I did my Lord, and was accounted         [Sidenote: did I]
a good Actor.

[Footnote 1: Here follows in _1st Q._

    Marke thou the King, doe but obserue his lookes,
    For I mine eies will riuet to his face:
    [Sidenote: 112] And if he doe not bleach, and change at that,
    It is a damned ghost that we haue seene.
    _Horatio_, haue a care, obserue him well.

    _Hor_. My lord, mine eies shall still be on his face,
    And not the smallest alteration
    That shall appeare in him, but I shall note it.]

[Footnote 2: I take 'my' to be right: 'watch my uncle with the
comment--the discriminating judgment, that is--of _my_ soul, more intent
than thine.']

[Footnote 3: He has then, ere this, taken Horatio into his
confidence--so far at least as the Ghost's communication concerning the
murder.]

[Footnote 4: a dissyllable: _stithy_, _anvil_; Scotch, _studdy_.

Hamlet's doubt is here very evident: he hopes he may find it a false
ghost: what good man, what good son would not? He has clear cause and
reason--it is his duty to delay. That the cause and reason and duty are
not invariably clear to Hamlet himself--not clear in every mood, is
another thing. Wavering conviction, doubt of evidence, the corollaries
of assurance, the oppression of misery, a sense of the worthlessness of
the world's whole economy--each demanding delay, might yet well, all
together, affect the man's feeling as mere causes of rather than reasons
for hesitation. The conscientiousness of Hamlet stands out the clearer
that, throughout, his dislike to his uncle, predisposing him to believe
any ill of him, is more than evident. By his incompetent or prejudiced
judges, Hamlet's accusations and justifications of himself are equally
placed to the _discredit_ of his account. They seem to think a man could
never accuse himself except he were in the wrong; therefore if ever he
excuses himself, he is the more certainly in the wrong: whatever point
may tell on the other side, it is to be disregarded.]

[Footnote 5: 'bring our two judgments together for comparison.']

[Footnote 6: 'in order to judge of the significance of his looks and
behaviour.']

[Footnote 7: Does he mean _foolish_, that is, _lunatic_? or
_insouciant_, and _unpreoccupied_?]

[Footnote 8: The king asks Hamlet how he _fares_--that is, how he gets
on; Hamlet pretends to think he has asked him about his diet. His talk
has at once become wild; ere the king enters he has donned his cloak of
madness. Here he confesses to ambition--will favour any notion
concerning himself rather than give ground for suspecting the real state
of his mind and feeling.

In the _1st Q._ 'the Camelions dish' almost appears to mean the play,
not the king's promises.]

[Footnote 9: In some places they push food down the throats of the
poultry they want to fatten, which is technically, I believe, called
_cramming_ them.]

[Footnote 10: 'You have not taken me with you; I have not laid hold of
your meaning; I have nothing by your answer.' 'Your words have not
become my property; they have not given themselves to me in their
meaning.']

[Footnote 11: _Point thus_: 'No, nor mine now.--My Lord,' &c. '--not
mine, now I have uttered them, for so I have given them away.' Or does
he mean to disclaim their purport?]

[Page 138]

_Ham._ And[1] what did you enact?

_Pol._ I did enact _Iulius Caesar_, I was kill'd
i'th'Capitol: _Brutus_ kill'd me.

_Ham._ It was a bruite part of him, to kill so
Capitall a Calfe there.[2] Be the Players ready?

_Rosin._ I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience.

_Qu._ Come hither my good _Hamlet_, sit by me.      [Sidenote: my deere]

_Ham._ No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue.[3]

_Pol._ Oh ho, do you marke that?[4]

_Ham._ Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?

_Ophe._ No my Lord.

_Ham._ I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?[5]

_Ophe._ I my Lord.[6]

_Ham._ Do you thinke I meant Country[7] matters?

_Ophe._ I thinke nothing, my Lord.

_Ham._ That's a faire thought to ly between
Maids legs.

_Ophe._ What is my Lord?

_Ham._ Nothing.

_Ophe._ You are merrie, my Lord?

_Ham._ Who I?

_Ophe._ I my Lord.[8]

_Ham._ Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker[9]: what
should a man do, but be merrie. For looke you

[Footnote 1: 'And ' _not in Q._]

[Footnote 2: Emphasis on _there_. 'There' is not in _1st Q._ Hamlet
means it was a desecration of the Capitol.]

[Footnote 3: He cannot be familiar with his mother, so avoids her--will
not sit by her, cannot, indeed, bear to be near her. But he loves and
hopes in Ophelia still.]

[Footnote 4: '--Did I not tell you so?']

[Footnote 5: This speech and the next are not in the _Q._, but are
shadowed in the _1st Q._]

[Footnote 6: _--consenting_.]

[Footnote 7: In _1st Quarto_, 'contrary.'

Hamlet hints, probing her character--hoping her unable to understand. It
is the festering soreness of his feeling concerning his mother, making
him doubt with the haunting agony of a loathed possibility, that
prompts, urges, forces from him his ugly speeches--nowise to be
justified, only to be largely excused in his sickening consciousness of
his mother's presence. Such pain as Hamlet's, the ferment of subverted
love and reverence, may lightly bear the blame of hideous manners,
seeing, they spring from no wantonness, but from the writhing of
tortured and helpless Purity. Good manners may be as impossible as out
of place in the presence of shameless evil.]

[Footnote 8: Ophelia bears with him for his own and his madness' sake,
and is less uneasy because of the presence of his mother. To account
_satisfactorily_ for Hamlet's speeches to her, is not easy. The freer
custom of the age, freer to an extent hardly credible in this, will not
_satisfy_ the lovers of Hamlet, although it must have _some_ weight. The
necessity for talking madly, because he is in the presence of his uncle,
and perhaps, to that end, for uttering whatever comes to him, without
pause for choice, might give us another hair's-weight. Also he may be
supposed confident that Ophelia would not understand him, while his
uncle would naturally set such worse than improprieties down to wildest
madness. But I suspect that here as before (123), Shakepere would show
Hamlet's soul full of bitterest, passionate loathing; his mother has
compelled him to think of horrors and women together, so turning their
preciousness into a disgust; and this feeling, his assumed madhess
allows him to indulge and partly relieve by utterance. Could he have
provoked Ophelia to rebuke him with the severity he courted, such rebuke
would have been joy to him. Perhaps yet a small addition of weight to
the scale of his excuse may be found in his excitement about his play,
and the necessity for keeping down that excitement. Suggestion is easier
than judgment.]

[Footnote 9: 'here's for the jig-maker! he's the right man!' Or perhaps
he is claiming the part as his own: 'I am your only jig-maker!']

[Footnote 10: This needs not be taken for the exact time. The statement
notwithstanding suggests something like two months between the first and
second acts, for in the first, Hamlet says his father has not been dead
two months. 24. We are not bound to take it for more than a rough
approximation; Ophelia would make the best of things for the queen, who

[Footnote 4: Very little blank verse of any kind was written before
Shakspere's; the usual form of dramatic verse was long, irregular, rimed
lines: the Poet here uses the heroic couplet, which gives a resemblance
to the older plays by its rimes, while also by its stately and
monotonous movement the play-play is differenced from the play into
which it is introduced, and caused to _look_ intrinsically like a play
in relation to the rest of the play of which it is part. In other words,
it stands off from the surrounding play, slightly elevated both by form
and formality. 103.]

[Footnote 6: Here Hamlet gives the time his father and mother had been
married, and Shakspere points at Hamlet's age. 234. The Poet takes
pains to show his hero's years.]

[Footnote 7: This line, whose form in the _Quarto_ is very careless,
seems but a careless correction, leaving the sense as well as the
construction obscure: 'Women's fear and love keep the scales level; in
_neither_ is there ought, or in _both_ there is fulness;' or: 'there is
no moderation in their fear and their love; either they have _none_ of
either, or they have _excess_ of both.' Perhaps he tried to express both
ideas at once. But compression is always in danger of confusion.]

Poet had not thought it worth his while to correct this subsidiary
portion of the drama. I do not see how to lay the blame on the
printer.--'Purpose is a mere fruit, which holds on or falls only as it
must. The element of persistency is not in it.']

the king stagger out blindly, madly, shaking them from him? I think
not--but as if he were taken suddenly ill.]

himself, and be regarded as careless-mad, until all are safely gone.]

By _Jove_, he of course intends _his father_. 170. What 'Paiocke' means,
whether _pagan_, or _peacock_, or _bajocco_, matters nothing, since it
is intended for nonsense.]

[Footnote 13: To rime with _was_, Horatio naturally expected _ass_ to
follow as the end of the last line: in the wanton humour of his
excitement, Hamlet disappointed him.]

[Footnote 14: _In Q. after next speech_.]

[Footnote 15: He hears Rosincrance and Guildensterne coming, and changes
his behaviour--calling for music to end the play with. Either he wants,
under its cover, to finish his talk with Horatio in what is for the
moment the safest place, or he would mask himself before his two false
friends. Since the departure of the king--I would suggest--he has borne
himself with evident apprehension, every now and then glancing about
him, as fearful of what may follow his uncle's recognition of the intent
of the play. Three times he has burst out singing.

Or might not his whole carriage, with the call for music, be the outcome
of a grimly merry satisfaction at the success of his scheme?]

some frame,[3] and start not so wildely from my        [Sidenote: stare]
affayre.

_Ham._ I am tame Sir, pronounce.

_Guild._ The Queene your Mother, in most great
affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.

_Ham._ You are welcome.[4]

_Guild._ Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is
not of the right breed. If it shall please you to
make me a wholsome answer, I will doe your
Mothers command'ment: if not, your pardon, and
my returne shall bee the end of my Businesse.    [Sidenote: of busines.]

_Ham._ Sir, I cannot.

_Guild._ What, my Lord?

_Ham._ Make you a wholsome answere: my wits
diseas'd. But sir, such answers as I can make, you   [Sidenote: answere]
shal command: or rather you say, my Mother:    [Sidenote: rather as you]
therfore no more but to the matter. My Mother
you say.

_Rosin._ Then thus she sayes: your behauior
hath stroke her into amazement, and admiration.[1]

_Ham._ Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish     [Sidenote: stonish]
a Mother. But is there no sequell at the heeles
of this Mothers admiration?              [Sidenote: admiration, impart.]

_Rosin._ She desires to speake with you in her
Closset, ere you go to bed.

_Ham._ We shall obey, were she ten times our
Mother. Haue you any further Trade with vs?

_Rosin._ My Lord, you once did loue me.

_Ham._ So I do still, by these pickers and     [Sidenote: And doe still]
stealers.[2]

_Rosin._ Good my Lord, what is your cause of
distemper? You do freely barre the doore of your

owne Libertie, if you deny your greefes to your your

_Ham._ Sir I lacke Aduancement.

_Rosin._ How can that be, when you haue the
[Sidenote: 136] voyce of the King himselfe, for your Succession in
Denmarke?

_Guild._ O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold,
my loue is too vnmannerly.[9]

_Ham._ I do not well vnderstand that.[10] Will you,
play vpon this Pipe?

_Guild._ My Lord, I cannot.

[Footnote 4: The assurance of his uncle's guilt, gained through the
effect of the play upon him, and the corroboration of his mother's guilt
by this partial confirmation of the Ghost's assertion, have once more
stirred in Hamlet the fierceness of vengeance. But here afresh comes
out the balanced nature of the man--say rather, the supremacy in him of
reason and will. His dear soul, having once become mistress of his
choice, remains mistress for ever. He _could_ drink hot blood, he
_could_ do bitter business, but he will carry himself as a son, and the
son of his father, _ought_ to carry himself towards a guilty
mother--_mother_ although guilty.]

[Footnote 5: Thus he girds himself for the harrowing interview. Aware of
the danger he is in of forgetting his duty to his mother, he strengthens
himself in filial righteousness, dreading to what word or deed a burst
of indignation might drive him. One of his troubles now is the way he
feels towards his mother.]

[Footnote 7: Schmidt (_Sh. Lex._) says _of vantage_ means _to boot_. I
do not think he is right. Perhaps Polonius means 'from a position of
advantage.' Or perhaps 'The speech of vantage' is to be understood as
implying that Hamlet, finding himself in a position of vantage, that is,
alone with his mother, will probably utter himself with little
restraint.]

[Footnote 8: This is the first proof positive of his guilt accorded even
to the spectator of the play: here Claudius confesses not merely guilt
(118), but the very deed. Thoughtless critics are so ready to judge
another as if he knew all they know, that it is desirable here to remind
the student that only he, not Hamlet, hears this soliloquy. The
falseness of half the judgments in the world comes from our not taking
care and pains first to know accurately the actions, and then to
understand the mental and moral condition, of those we judge.]

Here is the corresponding passage in the _1st Q._, with the adultery
plainly confessed:--

    When I looke vp to heauen, I see my trespasse,
    The earth doth still crie out vpon my fact,
    Pay me the murder of a brother and a king,
    And the adulterous fault I haue committed:
    O these are sinnes that are vnpardonable:
    Why say thy sinnes were blacker then is ieat,
    Yet may contrition make them as white as snowe:
    I but still to perseuer in a sinne,
    It is an act gainst the vniuersall power,
    Most wretched man, stoope, bend thee to thy prayer,
    Aske grace of heauen to keepe thee from despaire.]

[Footnote 2: both crimes.]

[Footnote 3: He could repent of and pray forgiveness for the murder, if
he could repent of the adultery and incest, and give up the queen. It is
not the sins they have done, but the sins they will not leave, that damn
men. 'This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.'
The murder deeply troubled him; the adultery not so much; the incest and
usurpation mainly as interfering with the forgiveness of the murder.]

[Footnote 4: Even hatred of crime committed is not repentance:
repentance is the turning away from wrong doing: 'Cease to do evil;
learn to do well.']

_Pol_. He will come straight:                         [Sidenote: A will]
Looke you lay home to him

[Footnote 1: In the _1st Q._ this speech commences with, 'I so, come
forth and worke thy last,' evidently addressed to his sword; afterwards,
having changed his purpose, he says, 'no, get thee vp agen.']

[Footnote 2: This indicates doubt of the Ghost still. He is unwilling to
believe in him.]

[Footnote 3: _grasp_. This is the only instance I know of _hent_ as a
noun. The verb _to hent, to lay hold of_, is not so rare. 'Wait till
thou be aware of a grasp with a more horrid purpose in it.']

[Footnote 4: --still addressed to his sword.]

[Footnote 5: Are we to take Hamlet's own presentment of his reasons as
exhaustive? Doubtless to kill him at his prayers, whereupon, after the
notions of the time, he would go to heaven, would be anything but
justice--the murdered man in hell--the murderer in heaven! But it is
easy to suppose Hamlet finding it impossible to slay a man on his
knees--and that from behind: thus in the unseen Presence, he was in
sanctuary, and the avenger might well seek reason or excuse for not
_then_, not _there_ executing the decree.]

[Footnote 6: 'waits for me.']

[Footnote 7: He seems now to have made up his mind, and to await only
fit time and opportunity; but he is yet to receive confirmation strong
as holy writ.

This is the first chance Hamlet has had--within the play--of killing the
king, and any imputation of faulty irresolution therein is simply silly.
It shows the soundness of Hamlet's reason, and the steadiness of his
will, that he refuses to be carried away by passion, or the temptation
of opportunity. The sight of the man on his knees might well start fresh
doubt of his guilt, or even wake the thought of sparing a repentant
sinner. He knows also that in taking vengeance on her husband he could
not avoid compromising his mother. Besides, a man like Hamlet could not
fail to perceive how the killing of his uncle, and in such an attitude,
would look to others.

It may be judged, however, that the reason he gives to himself for not
slaying the king, was only an excuse, that his soul revolted from the
idea of assassination, and was calmed in a measure by the doubt whether
a man could thus pray--in supposed privacy, we must remember--and be a
murderer. Not even yet had he proof _positive_, absolute, conclusive:
the king might well take offence at the play, even were he innocent; and
in any case Hamlet would desire _presentable_ proof: he had positively
none to show the people in justification of vengeance.

As in excitement a man's moods may be opalescent in their changes, and
as the most contrary feelings may coexist in varying degrees, all might
be in a mind, which I have suggested as present in that of Hamlet.

To have been capable of the kind of action most of his critics would
demand of a man, Hamlet must have been the weakling they imagine him.
When at length, after a righteous delay, partly willed, partly
inevitable, he holds documents in the king's handwriting as proofs of
his treachery--_proofs which can be shown_--giving him both right and
power over the life of the traitor, then, and only then, is he in cool
blood absolutely satisfied as to his duty--which conviction, working
with opportunity, and that opportunity plainly the last, brings the end;
the righteous deed is done, and done righteously, the doer blameless in
the doing of it. The Poet is not careful of what is called poetic
justice in his play, though therein is no failure; what he is careful of
is personal rightness in the hero of it.]

[Footnote 8: _1st Q_.

    _King_ My wordes fly vp, my sinnes remaine below.
    No King on earth is safe, if Gods his foe. _Exit King_.

So he goes to make himself safe by more crime! His repentance is mainly
fear.]

[Footnote 10: The apprehension comes from the combined action of her
conscience and the notion of his madness.]

[Footnote 11: There is no precipitancy here--only instant resolve and
execution. It is another outcome and embodiment of Hamlet's rare faculty
for action, showing his delay the more admirable. There is here neither
time nor call for delay. Whoever the man behind the arras might be, he
had, by spying upon him in the privacy of his mother's room, forfeited
to Hamlet his right to live; he had heard what he had said to his
mother, and his death was necessary; for, if he left the room, Hamlet's
last chance of fulfilling his vow to the Ghost was gone: if the play had
not sealed, what he had now spoken must seal his doom. But the decree
had in fact already gone forth against his life. 158.]

_Ham._ Such an Act
That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,[7]
Calls Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose
From the faire forehead of an innocent loue,
And makes a blister there.[8] Makes marriage vowes

As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,
As from the body of Contraction[9] pluckes
The very soule, and sweete Religion makes
A rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow,           [Sidenote: dooes]
Yea this solidity and compound masse,               [Sidenote: Ore this]
With tristfull visage as against the doome,
                                         [Sidenote: with heated visage,]
Is thought-sicke at the act.[10]                [Sidenote: thought sick]

_Qu._ Aye me; what act,[11] that roares so lowd,[12]
and thunders in the Index.[13]

[Footnote 1: _Not in Q._]

[Footnote 2: --_through the arras_.]

[Footnote 3: Hamlet takes him for, hopes it is the king, and thinks here
to conclude: he is not praying now! and there is not a moment to be
lost, for he has betrayed his presence and called for help. As often as
immediate action is demanded of Hamlet, he is immediate with his
response--never hesitates, never blunders. There is no blunder here:
being where he was, the death of Polonius was necessary now to the death
of the king. Hamlet's resolve is instant, and the act simultaneous with
the resolve. The weak man is sure to be found wanting when immediate
action is necessary; Hamlet never is. Doubtless those who blame him as
dilatory, here blame him as precipitate, for they judge according to
appearance and consequence.

All his delay after this is plainly compelled, although I grant he was
not sorry to have to await such _more presentable_ evidence as at last
he procured, so long as he did not lose the final possibility of
vengeance.]

[Footnote 4: This is the sole reference in the interview to the murder.
I take it for tentative, and that Hamlet is satisfied by his mother's
utterance, carriage, and expression, that she is innocent of any
knowledge of that crime. Neither does he allude to the adultery: there
is enough in what she cannot deny, and that only which can be remedied
needs be taken up; while to break with the king would open the door of
repentance for all that had preceded.]

[Footnote 5: He says nothing of the Ghost to his mother.]

[Footnote 6: She still holds up and holds out.]

[Footnote 7: 'makes Modesty itself suspected.']

[Footnote 8: 'makes Innocence ashamed of the love it cherishes.']

[Footnote 9: 'plucks the spirit out of all forms of contracting or
agreeing.' We have lost the social and kept only the physical meaning of
the noun.]

[Footnote 10: I cannot help thinking the _Quarto_ reading of this
passage the more intelligible, as well as much the more powerful. We may
imagine a red aurora, by no means a very unusual phenomenon, over the
expanse of the sky:--

            Heaven's face doth glow (_blush_)
    O'er this solidity and compound mass,

(_the earth, solid, material, composite, a corporeal mass in
confrontment with the spirit-like etherial, simple, uncompounded heaven
leaning over it_)

    With tristful (_or_ heated, _as the reader may choose_)
          visage: as against the doom,

(_as in the presence, or in anticipation of the revealing judgment_)

    Is thought sick at the act.

(_thought is sick at the act of the queen_)

My difficulties as to the _Folio_ reading are--why the earth should be
so described without immediate contrast with the sky; and--how the earth
could be showing a tristful visage, and the sickness of its thought. I
think, if the Poet indeed made the alterations and they are not mere
blunders, he must have made them hurriedly, and without due attention. I
would not forget, however, that there may be something present but too
good for me to find, which would make the passage plain as it stands.

Compare _As you like it_, act i. sc. 3.

    For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
    Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.]

begins here, taking up the queen's word.]

[Footnote 12: She still stands out.]

'the Index' may be intended the influx or table of contents of a book,

the accusation: her consciousness of her own guiit has overwhelmed her.]

[Footnote 9: The _1st Q._ has _Enter the ghost in his night gowne_. It
was then from the first intended that he should not at this point appear
in armour--in which, indeed, the epithet _gracious figure_ could hardly
be applied to him, though it might well enough in one of the costumes in
which Hamlet was accustomed to see him--as this dressing-gown of the
_1st Q._ A ghost would appear in the costume in which he naturally
imagined himself, and in his wife's room would not show himself clothed
as when walking among the fortifications of the castle. But by the words
lower down (174)--

    My Father in his habite, as he liued,

the Poet indicates, not his dressing-gown, but his usual habit, _i.e._
attire.]

[Footnote 10: --almost the same invocation as when first he saw the
apparition.]

[Footnote 11: The queen cannot see the Ghost. Her conduct has built such
a wall between her and her husband that I doubt whether, were she a
ghost also, she could see him. Her heart had left him, so they are no
more together in the sphere of mutual vision. Neither does the Ghost
wish to show himself to her. As his presence is not corporeal, a ghost
may be present to but one of a company.]

[Footnote 12: 1. 'Who, lapsed (_fallen, guilty_), lets action slip in
delay and suffering.' 2. 'Who, lapsed in (_fallen in, overwhelmed by_)
delay and suffering, omits' &c. 3. 'lapsed in respect of time, and
because of passion'--the meaning of the preposition _in_, common to
both, reacted upon by the word it governs. 4. 'faulty both in delaying,
and in yielding to suffering, when action is required.' 5. 'lapsed
through having too much time and great suffering.' 6. 'allowing himself
to be swept along by time and grief.'

Surely there is not another writer whose words would so often admit of
such multiform and varied interpretation--each form good, and true, and
suitable to the context! He seems to see at once all the relations of a
thing, and to try to convey them at once, in an utterance single as the
thing itself. He would condense the infinite soul of the meaning into
the trembling, overtaxed body of the phrase!]

[Footnote 13: In the renewed presence of the Ghost, all its former
influence and all the former conviction of its truth, return upon him.
He knows also how his behaviour must appear to the Ghost, and sees
himself as the Ghost sees him. Confronted with the gracious figure, how
should he think of self-justification! So far from being able to explain
things, he even forgets the doubt that had held him back--it has
vanished from the noble presence! He is now in the world of belief; the
world of doubt is nowhere!--Note the masterly opposition of moods.]

His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capeable.[10] Do not looke vpon me,[11]
Least with this pitteous action you conuert
My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,[12]

[Footnote 1: The Ghost here judges, as alone is possible to him, from
what he knows--from the fact that his brother Claudius has not yet made
his appearance in the ghost-world. Not understanding Hamlet's
difficulties, he mistakes Hamlet himself.]

[Footnote 2: He mistakes also, through his tenderness, the condition of
his wife--imagining, it would seem, that she feels his presence, though
she cannot see him, or recognize the source of the influence which he
supposes to be moving her conscience: she is only perturbed by Hamlet's
behaviour.]

[Footnote 5: His last word ere he vanishes utterly, concerns his queen;
he is tender and gracious still to her who sent him to hell. This
attitude of the Ghost towards his faithless wife, is one of the
profoundest things in the play. All the time she is not thinking of him
any more than seeing him--for 'is he not dead!'--is looking straight at
where he stands, but is all unaware of him.]

[Footnote 6: I understand him to speak this with a kind of lost,
mechanical obedience. The description his mother gives of him makes it
seem as if the Ghost were drawing his ghost out to himself, and turning
his body thereby half dead.]

[Footnote 7: 'as if there were life in excrements.' The nails and hair
were 'excrements'--things _growing out_.]

piteous show convert--change--my stern doing; then what I do will lack
true colour; the result may be tears instead of blood; I shall weep
instead of striking.']

[Footnote 4: --_time_ being a great part of music. Shakspere more than
once or twice employs _music_ as a symbol with reference to corporeal
condition: see, for instance, _As you like it_, act i. sc. 2, 'But is
there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? is there yet
another dotes upon rib-breaking?' where the _broken music_ may be
regarded as the antithesis of the _healthful music_ here.]

[Footnote 5: _swoln, pampered_: an allusion to the _purse_ itself,
whether intended or not, is suggested.]

[Footnote 6: _bend, bow_.]

[Footnote 7: To _assume_ is to take to one: by _assume a virtue_, Hamlet
does not mean _pretend_--but the very opposite: _to pretend_ is _to hold
forth, to show_; what he means is, 'Adopt a virtue'--that of
_abstinence_--'and act upon it, order your behaviour by it, although you
may not _feel_ it. Choose the virtue--take it, make it yours.']

[Footnote 8: This omitted passage is obscure with the special
Shaksperean obscurity that comes of over-condensation. He omitted it, I
think, because of its obscurity. Its general meaning is plain
enough--that custom helps the man who tries to assume a virtue, as well
as renders it more and more difficult for him who indulges in vice to
leave it. I will paraphrase: 'That monster, Custom, who eats away all
sense, the devil of habits, is angel yet in this, that, for the exercise
of fair and good actions, he also provides a habit, a suitable frock or
livery, that is easily put on.' The play with the two senses of the word
_habit_ is more easily seen than set forth. To paraphrase more freely:
'That devil of habits, Custom, who eats away all sense of wrong-doing,
has yet an angel-side to him, in that he gives a man a mental dress, a
habit, helpful to the doing of the right thing.' The idea of hypocrisy
does not come in at all. The advice of Hamlet is: 'Be virtuous in your
actions, even if you cannot in your feelings; do not do the wrong thing
you would like to do, and custom will render the abstinence easy.']

[Footnote 9: I suspect it should be '_Of habits evil_'--the antithesis
to _angel_ being _monster_.]

the custom of the time, have sought her blessing: it would be a farce
now: when she seeks the blessing of God, he will beg hers; now, a plain
_good night_ must serve.]

[Footnote 2: Note the curious inverted use of _pleased_. It is here a
transitive, not an impersonal verb. The construction of the sentence is,
'pleased it so, _in order to_ punish us, that I must' &c.]

[Footnote 10: Hamlet considers his madness the same that he so
deliberately assumed. But his idea of himself goes for nothing where the
experts conclude him mad! His absolute clarity where he has no occasion
to act madness, goes for as little, for 'all madmen have their sane
moments'!]

[Footnote 14: I fancy the story, which so far as I know has not been
traced, goes on to say that the basket was emptied from the house-top to
send the pigeons flying, and so the ape got his neck broken. The phrase
'breake your owne necke _downe_' seems strange: it could hardly have
been written _neck-bone_!]

[Footnote 15: This passage would fall in better with the preceding with
which it is vitally one--for it would more evenly continue its form--if
the preceding _devil_ were, as I propose above, changed to _evil_. But,
precious as is every word in them, both passages are well omitted.]

is no authority for the supplied _master_. I am inclined to propose a
pause and a gesture, with perhaps an _inarticulation_.]

speak; but I would prefer it thus: 'One word more:--good lady--' Here
he pauses so long that she speaks. Or we _might_ read it thus:

[Footnote 5: It may cross him, as he says this, dragging the body out by
one end of it, and toward the end of its history, that he is himself
drawing toward an end along with Polonius.]

[Footnote 6: --_and weeping_. 182. See _note_ 5, 183.]

[Footnote 7: Here, according to the editors, comes 'Act IV.' For this
there is no authority, and the point of division seems to me very
objectionable. The scene remains the same, as noted from Capell in _Cam.
Sh._, and the entrance of the king follows immediately on the exit of
Hamlet. He finds his wife greatly perturbed; she has not had time to
compose herself.

From the beginning of Act II., on to where I would place the end of Act
III., there is continuity.]

[Footnote 8: I would have this speech uttered with pauses and growing
urgency, mingled at length with displeasure.]

[Footnote 9: She is faithful to her son, declaring him mad, and
attributing the death of 'the unseen' Polonius to his madness.]

[Footnote 10: This passage, like the rest, I hold to be omitted by
Shakspere himself. It represents Hamlet as divining the plot with whose
execution his false friends were entrusted. The Poet had at first
intended Hamlet to go on board the vessel with a design formed upon this
for the out-witting of his companions, and to work out that design.
Afterwards, however, he alters his plan, and represents his escape as
more plainly providential: probably he did not see how to manage it by
any scheme of Hamlet so well as by the attack of a pirate; possibly he
wished to write the passage (246) in which Hamlet, so consistently with
his character, attributes his return to the divine shaping of the end
rough-hewn by himself. He had designs--'dear plots'--but they were other
than fell out--a rough-hewing that was shaped to a different end. The
discomfiture of his enemies was not such as he had designed: it was
brought about by no previous plot, but through a discovery. At the same
time his deliverance was not effected by the fingering of the packet,
but by the attack of the pirate: even the re-writing of the commission
did nothing towards his deliverance, resulted only in the punishment of
his traitorous companions. In revising the Quarto, the Poet sees that
the passage before us, in which is expressed the strongest suspicion of
his companions, with a determination to outwit and punish them, is
inconsistent with the representation Hamlet gives afterwards of a
restlessness and suspicion newly come upon him, which he attributes to
the Divinity.

Neither was it likely he would say so much to his mother while so little
sure of her as to warn her, on the ground of danger to herself, against
revealing his sanity to the king. As to this, however, the portion
omitted might, I grant, be regarded as an _aside_.]

[Footnote 4: by his weeping, in the midst of much to give a different
impression.]

[Footnote 5: We have no reason to think the queen inventing here: what
could she gain by it? the point indeed was rather against Hamlet, as
showing it was not Polonius he had thought to kill. He was more than
ever annoyed with the contemptible old man, who had by his
meddlesomeness brought his death to his door; but he was very sorry
nevertheless over Ophelia's father: those rough words in his last speech
are spoken with the tears running down his face. We have seen the
strange, almost discordant mingling in him of horror and humour, after
the first appearance of the Ghost, 58, 60: something of the same may be
supposed when he finds he has killed Polonius: in the highstrung nervous
condition that must have followed such a talk with his mother, it would
be nowise strange that he should weep heartily even in the midst of
contemptuous anger. Or perhaps a sudden breakdown from attempted show of
indifference, would not be amiss in the representation.]

[Footnote 9: Here most modern editors insert, '_so, haply, slander_'.
But, although I think the Poet left out this obscure passage merely from
dissatisfaction with it, I believe it renders a worthy sense as it
stands. The antecedent to _whose_ is _friends_: _cannon_ is nominative
to _transports_; and the only difficulty is the epithet _poysned_
applied to _shot_, which seems transposed from the idea of an
_unfriendly_ whisper. Perhaps Shakspere wrote _poysed shot_. But taking
this as it stands, the passage might be paraphrased thus: 'Whose

world to the other_), as level (_as truly aimed_) as the cannon (of an
evil whisper) transports its poisoned shot to his blank (_the white
centre of the target_), may shoot past our name (so keeping us clear),
and hit only the invulnerable air.' ('_the intrenchant air_': _Macbeth_,
act v. sc. 8). This interpretation rests on the idea of
over-condensation with its tendency to seeming confusion--the only fault
I know in the Poet--a grand fault, peculiarly his own, born of the
beating of his wings against the impossible. It is much as if, able to
think two thoughts at once, he would compel his phrase to utter them at
once.]

[Footnote 10: The original, the _Quarto_ reading--'_my ioyes will nere

as follows.

In the _Quarto_ the next scene stands as in our modern editions, ending
with the rime,

                  ô from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth.   _Exit_.

This was the act-pause, the natural end of act iii.

But when the author struck out all but the commencement of the scene,
leaving only the three little speeches of Fortinbras and his captain,
then plainly the act-pause must fall at the end of the preceding scene.
He therefore altered the end of the last verse to make it rime with the
foregoing, in accordance with his frequent way of using a rime before an
important pause.

It perplexes us to think how on his way to the vessel, Hamlet could fall
in with the Norwegian captain. This may have been one of Shakspere's
reasons for striking the whole scene out--but he had other and more
pregnant reasons.]

that, then the small part left of the all-but-cancelled scene must open
the fourth act.]

far off_, else why should Norway care about it at all? If the word
_frontier_ has the meaning, as the _Shakespeare Lexicon_ says, of 'an
outwork in fortification,' its use two lines back would, taken
figuratively, tend to support this.]

[Footnote 8: The meaning may be as in the following paraphrase: 'This
quarrelling about nothing is (the breaking of) the abscess caused by
wealth and peace--which breaking inward (in general corruption), would
show no outward sore in sign of why death came.' Or it might be _forced_
thus:--

    This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace.
    That (which) inward breaks, and shows no cause without--
    Why, the man dies!

But it may mean:--'The war is an imposthume, which will break within,
and cause much affliction to the people that make the war.' On the other
hand, Hamlet seems to regard it as a process for, almost a sign of
health.]

[Footnote 9: Note his freedom.]

[Footnote 10: _See_ 'examples grosse as earth' _below_.]

[Footnote 11: While every word that Shakspere wrote we may well take
pains to grasp thoroughly, my endeavour to cast light on this passage is
made with the distinct understanding in my own mind that the author
himself disapproved of and omitted it, and that good reason is not
wanting why he should have done so. At the same time, if my student, for
this book is for those who would have help and will take pains to the
true understanding of the play, would yet retain the passage, I protest
against the acceptance of Hamlet's judgment of himself, except as
revealing the simplicity and humility of his nature and character. That
as often as a vivid memory of either interview with the Ghost came back
upon him, he should feel rebuked and ashamed, and vexed with himself,
is, in the morally, intellectually, and emotionally troubled state of
his mind, nowise the less natural that he had the best of reasons for
the delay because of which he _here_ so unmercifully abuses himself. A
man of self-satisfied temperament would never in similar circumstances
have done so. But Hamlet was, by nature and education, far from such
self-satisfaction; and there is in him besides such a strife and turmoil
of opposing passions and feelings and apparent duties, as can but rarely
rise in a human soul. With which he ought to side, his conscience is not
sure--sides therefore now with one, now with another. At the same time
it is by no means the long delay the critics imagine of which he is
accusing himself--it is only that the thing _is not done_.

In certain moods the action a man dislikes will _therefore_ look to him
the more like a duty; and this helps to prevent Hamlet from knowing
always how great a part conscience bears in the omission because of
which he condemns and even contemns himself. The conscience does not
naturally examine itself--is not necessarily self-conscious. In any
soliloquy, a man must speak from his present mood: we who are not
suffering, and who have many of his moods before us, ought to understand
Hamlet better than he understands himself. To himself, sitting in
judgment on himself, it would hardly appear a decent cause of, not to
say reason for, a moment's delay in punishing his uncle, that he was so
weighed down with misery because of his mother and Ophelia, that it
seemed of no use to kill one villain out of the villainous world; it
would seem but 'bestial oblivion'; and, although his reputation as a
prince was deeply concerned, _any_ reflection on the consequences to
himself would at times appear but a 'craven scruple'; while at times
even the whispers of conscience might seem a 'thinking too precisely on
the event.' A conscientious man of changeful mood wilt be very ready in
either mood to condemn the other. The best and rightest men will
sometimes accuse themselves in a manner that seems to those who know
them best, unfounded, unreasonable, almost absurd. We must not, I say,
take the hero's judgment of himself as the author's judgment of him. The
two judgments, that of a man upon himself from within, and that of his
beholder upon him from without, are not congeneric. They are different
in origin and in kind, and cannot be adopted either of them into the
source of the other without most serious and dangerous mistake. So
adopted, each becomes another thing altogether. It is to me probable
that, although it involves other unfitnesses, the Poet omitted the
passage chiefly from coming to see the danger of its giving occasion, or
at least support, to an altogether mistaken and unjust idea of his
Hamlet.]

[Footnote 8: I am in doubt whether this passage from 'What is a man'
down to 'unused,' does not refer to the king, and whether Hamlet is not
persuading himself that it can be no such objectionable thing to kill
one hardly above a beast. At all events it is far more applicable to the
king: it was not one of Hamlet's faults, in any case, to fail of using
his reason. But he may just as well accuse himself of that too! At the
same time the worst neglect of reason lies in not carrying out its
conclusions, and if we cannot justify Hamlet in his delay, the passage
is of good application to him. 'Bestiall oblivion' does seem to connect
himself with the reflection; but how thoroughly is the thing intended by
such a phrase alien from the character of Hamlet!]

[Footnote 9: --the mental faculty of running hither and thither: 'We
look before and after.' _Shelley: To a Skylark_.]

[Footnote 10: --the forgetfulness of such a beast as he has just
mentioned.]

[Footnote 11: --the _consequences_. The scruples that come of thinking
of the event, Hamlet certainly had: that they were _craven_ scruples,
that his thinking was too precise, I deny to the face of the noble
self-accuser. Is that a craven scruple which, seeing no good to result
from the horrid deed, shrinks from its irretrievableness, and demands at
least absolute assurance of guilt? or that 'a thinking too precisely on
the event,' to desire, as the prince of his people, to leave an un
wounded name behind him?]

[Footnote 12: This passage is the strongest there is on the side of the
ordinary misconception of the character of Hamlet. It comes from
himself; and it is as ungenerous as it is common and unfair to use such
a weapon against a man. Does any but St. Paul himself say he was the
chief of sinners? Consider Hamlet's condition, tormented on all sides,
within and without, and think whether this outbreak against himself be
not as unfair as it is natural. Lest it should be accepted against him,
Shakspere did well to leave it out. In bitter disappointment, both
because of what is and what is not, both because of what he has done and
what he has failed to do, having for the time lost all chance, with the
last vision of the Ghost still haunting his eyes, his last reproachful
words yet ringing in his ears, are we bound to take his judgment of
himself because it is against himself? Are we _bound_ to take any man's
judgment because it is against himself? I answer, 'No more than if it
were for himself.' A good man's judgment, where he is at all perplexed,
especially if his motive comes within his own question, is ready to be
against himself, as a bad man's is sure to be for himself. Or because he
is a philosopher, does it follow that throughout he understands himself?
Were such a man in cool, untroubled conditions, we might feel compelled
to take his judgment, but surely not here! A philosopher in such state
as Hamlet's would understand the quality of his spiritual operations
with no more certainty than another man. In his present mood, Hamlet
forgets the cogency of the reasons that swayed him in the other; forgets
that his uppermost feeling then was doubt, as horror, indignation, and
conviction are uppermost now. Things were never so clear to Hamlet as to
us.

But how can he say he has strength and means--in the position in which
he now finds himself? I am glad to be able to believe, let my defence of
Hamlet against himself be right or wrong, that Shakspere intended the
omission of the passage. I lay nothing on the great lack of logic
throughout the speech, for that would not make it unfit for Hamlet in
such mood, while it makes its omission from the play of less consequence
to my general argument.]

[Footnote 13: _threaten_. This supports my argument as to the great
soliloquy--that it was death as the result of his slaying the king, or
attempting to do so, not death by suicide, he was thinking of: he
expected to die himself in the punishing of his uncle.]

[Footnote 19: If, with this speech in his mouth, Hamlet goes coolly on
board the vessel, _not being compelled thereto_ (190, 192, 216), and
possessing means to his vengeance, as here he says, and goes merely in
order to hoist Rosincrance and Guildensterne with their own petard--that
is, if we must keep the omitted passages, then the author exposes his
hero to a more depreciatory judgment than any from which I would justify
him, and a conception of his character entirely inconsistent with the
rest of the play. He did not observe the risk at the time he wrote the
passage, but discovering it afterwards, rectified the oversight--to the
dissatisfaction of his critics, who have agreed in restoring what he
cancelled.]

Hamlet's apparent madness would seem to pass into real madness in
Ophelia. King Lear's growing perturbation becomes insanity the moment he
sees the pretended madman Edgar.

The forms of Ophelia's madness show it was not her father's death that
drove her mad, but his death by the hand of Hamlet, which, with Hamlet's
banishment, destroyed all the hope the queen had been fostering in her
of marrying him some day.]

cookery; but it is so used elsewhere by Shakspere that we cannot regard
it here as a scintillation of Ophelia's insanity.]

[Footnote 7: 'feel much grief for it.']

[Footnote 5: Laertes is a ranter--false everywhere.

Plainly he is introduced as the foil from which Hamlet 'shall stick
fiery off.' In this speech he shows his moral condition directly the
opposite of Hamlet's: he has no principle but revenge. His conduct ought
to be quite satisfactory to Hamlet's critics; there is action enough in
it of the very kind they would have of Hamlet; and doubtless it would be
satisfactory to them but for the treachery that follows. The one, dearly
loving a father who deserves immeasurably better of him than Polonius of
Laertes, will not for the sake of revenge disregard either conscience,
justice, or grace; the other will not delay even to inquire into the
facts of his father's fate, but will act at once on hearsay, rushing to
a blind satisfaction that cannot even be called retaliation, caring for
neither right nor wrong, cursing conscience and the will of God, and
daring damnation. He slights assurance as to the hand by which his
father fell, dismisses all reflection that might interfere with a stupid
revenge. To make up one's mind at once, and act without ground, is
weakness, not strength: this Laertes does--and is therefore just the man
to be the villainous, not the innocent, tool of villainy. He who has
sufficing ground and refuses to act is weak; but the ground that will
satisfy the populace, of which the commonplace critic is the fair type,
will not satisfy either the man of conscience or of wisdom. The mass of
world-bepraised action owes its existence to the pressure of
circumstance, not to the will and conscience of the man. Hamlet waits
for light, even with his heart accusing him; Laertes rushes into the
dark, dagger in hand, like a mad Malay: so he kill, he cares not whom.
Such a man is easily tempted to the vilest treachery, for the light that
is in him is darkness; he is not a true man; he is false in himself.
This is what comes of his father's maxim:

    To thine own self be true;
    And it must follow, _as the night the day_ (!)
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.

Like the aphorism 'Honesty is the best policy,' it reveals the
difference between a fact and a truth. Both sayings are correct as
facts, but as guides of conduct devilishly false, leading to dishonesty
and treachery. To be true to the divine self in us, is indeed to be true
to all; but it is only by being true to all, against the ever present
and urging false self, that at length we shall see the divine self rise
above the chaotic waters of our selfishness, and know it so as to be
true to it.

Of Laertes we must note also that it is not all for love of his father
that he is ready to cast allegiance to hell, and kill the king: he has
the voice of the people to succeed him.]

soul'; then the meaning would be, 'Nature is fine always in love, and
where the soul also is fine, she sends from it' &c. But the _where_ may
be equal, perhaps, to _whereas_. I can hardly think the phrase means
merely '_and where it is in love_.' It might intend--'and where Love is
fine, it sends' &c. The 'precious instance of itself,' that is,
'something that is a part and specimen of itself,' is here the 'young
maid's wits': they are sent after the 'old man's life.'--These three
lines are not in the Quarto. It is not disputed that they are from
Shakspere's hand: if the insertion of these be his, why should the
omission of others not be his also?]

a corruption, whether Ophelia's or the printer's, of the _Quarto_
reading, '_God a mercy_' which, spoken quickly, sounds very near
_gramercy_. The _1st Quarto_ also has 'God a mercy.']

according to form or rule.]

[Footnote 2: 'so that I must call in question'--institute inquiry; or
'--_that_ (these things) I must call in question.']

[Footnote 3: Note such a half line frequently after the not uncommon
closing couplet--as if to take off the formality of the couplet, and
lead back, through the more speech-like, to greater verisimilitude.]

[Footnote 4: Here the servant goes, and the rest of the speech Horatio
speaks _solus_. He had expected to hear from Hamlet.]

[Footnote 5: 'and it please'--_if it please_. _An_ for _if_ is merely
_and_.]

[Footnote 7: _Not in Q_.]

[Footnote 8: This gives an approximate clue to the time between the
second and third acts: it needs not have been a week.]

[Footnote 9: Note once more the unfailing readiness of Hamlet where
there was no question as to the fitness of the action seemingly
required. This is the man who by too much thinking, forsooth, has
rendered himself incapable of action!--so far ahead of the foremost
behind him, that, when the pirate, not liking such close quarters, 'on
the instant got clear,' he is the only one on her deck! There was no
question here as to what ought to be done: the pirate grappled them; he
boarded her. Thereafter, with his prompt faculty for dealing with men,
he soon comes to an understanding with his captors, and they agree, upon
some certain condition, to put him on shore.

He writes in unusual spirits; for he has now gained full, presentable,
and indisputable proof of the treachery which before he scarcely
doubted, but could not demonstrate. The present instance of it has to do
with himself, not his father, but in itself would justify the slaying of
his uncle, whose plausible way had possibly perplexed him so that he
could not thoroughly believe him the villain he was: bad as he must be,
could he actually have killed his own brother, and _such_ a brother? A
better man than Laertes might have acted more promptly than Hamlet, and
so happened to _do_ right; but he would not have _been_ right, for the
proof was _not_ sufficient.]

[Footnote 10: The value Hamlet sets on his discovery, evident in his
joyous urgency to share it with his friend, is explicable only on the
ground of the relief it is to his mind to be now at length quite certain
of his duty.]

[Footnote 1: Note here also Hamlet's feeling of the importance of what
has passed since he parted with his friend. 'The bullet of my words,
though it will strike thee dumb, is much too small for the bore of the
reality (the facts) whence it will issue.']

[Footnote 1: 'would convert his fetters--if I imprisoned him--to graces,
commending him yet more to their regard.']

[Footnote 2: _arm'd_ is certainly the right, and a true Shaksperean
word:--it was no fault in the aim, but in the force of the flight--no
matter of the eye, but of the arm, which could not give momentum enough
to such slightly timbered arrows. The fault in the construction of the
last line, I need not remark upon.

I think there is a hint of this the genuine meaning even in the
blundered and partly unintelligible reading of the _Quarto_. If we leave
out 'for so loued,' we have this: 'So that my arrows, too slightly
timbered, would have reverted armed to my bow again, but not (_would not
have gone_) where I have aimed them,'--implying that his arrows would
have turned their armed heads against himself.

What the king says here is true, but far from _the_ truth: he feared
driving Hamlet, and giving him at the same time opportunity, to speak in
his own defence and render his reasons.]

[Footnote 3: _extremes_? or _conditions_?]

At this point in the _1st Q._ comes a scene between Horatio and the
queen, in which he informs her of a letter he had just received from
Hamlet,

    Whereas he writes how he escap't the danger,
    And subtle treason that the king had plotted,
    Being crossed by the contention of the windes,
    He found the Packet &c.

Horatio does not mention the pirates, but speaks of Hamlet 'being set
ashore,' and of _Gilderstone_ and _Rossencraft_ going on to their fate.
The queen assures Horatio that she is but temporizing with the king, and
shows herself anxious for the success of her son's design against his
life. The Poet's intent was not yet clear to himself.]

Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,
_Hamlet_ return'd, shall know you are come home:

taken as Laertes may please.]

notes in _Johnson and Steevens_.]

_Quarto_ between the _e_ and the comma gives the probability that a
letter has dropt out.]

[Footnote 14: Modern editors seem agreed to substitute the adjective
_spendthrift_: our sole authority has _spendthrifts_, and by it I hold.
The meaning seems this: 'the _would_ changes, the thing is not done, and
then the _should_, the mere acknowledgment of duty, is like the sigh of
a spendthrift, who regrets consequences but does not change his way: it
eases his conscience for a moment, and so injures him.' There would at
the same time be allusion to what was believed concerning sighs: Dr.
Johnson says, 'It is a notion very prevalent, that _sighs_ impair the
strength, and wear out the animal powers.']

for heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe

branches. It is an Act to doe and to performe;

no ancient Gentlemen, but Gardiners, Ditchers and
Graue-makers; they hold vp _Adams_ Profession.

dig'd; could hee digge without Armes?[4] Ile put
another question to thee; if thou answerest me not
to the purpose, confesse thy selfe----

_Other_. Go too.

_Clo_. What is he that builds stronger then either
the Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?

Gallowes does well; but how does it well? it does
well to those that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say
the Gallowes is built stronger then the Church:
Argall, the Gallowes may doe well to thee. Too't
againe, Come.

Shipwright, or a Carpenter?

[Footnote 5: The word is to be found in any dictionary, but is not
generally understood. Lord Byron, a very inaccurate writer, takes it to
mean _heel_:

    Devices quaint, and frolics ever new,
      Tread on each others' kibes:

_Childe Harold, Canto 1. St. 67._

It means a _chilblain_.]

than Hamlet, and may have been older. Hamlet then, in the Quarto
passage, could not by _tender_ mean _young_.]

_How_ may be _how much_, in retort to the _very_; but the intent would
be the same--a request for further information.]

[Footnote 8: Hamlet has asked on what ground or provocation, that is,
from what cause, Hamlet lost his wits; the sexton chooses to take the
word _ground_ materially.]

[Footnote 9: The Poet makes him say how long he had been sexton--but how
naturally and informally--by a stupid joke!--in order a second time, and
more certainly, to tell us Hamlet's age: he must have held it a point
necessary to the understanding of Hamlet.

Note Hamlet's question immediately following. It looks as if he had
first said to himself: 'Yes--I have been thirty years above ground!' and
_then_ said to the sexton, 'How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he
rot?' We might enquire even too curiously as to the connecting links.]

[Footnote 1: This fine speech is yet spoken in the character of madman,
which Hamlet puts on once more the moment he has to appear before the
king. Its poetry and dignity belong to Hamlet's feeling; its
extravagance to his assumed insanity. It must be remembered that death
is a small affair to Hamlet beside his mother's life, and that the death
of Ophelia may even be some consolation to him.

In the _Folio_, a few lines back, Laertes leaps into the grave. There is
no such direction in the _Q_. In neither is Hamlet said to leap into the
grave; only the _1st Q._ so directs. It is a stage-business that must
please the _common_ actor of Hamlet; but there is nothing in the text
any more than in the margin of _Folio_ or _Quarto_ to justify it, and it
would but for the horror of it be ludicrous. The coffin is supposed to
be in the grave: must Laertes jump down upon it, followed by Hamlet, and
the two fight and trample over the body?

Yet I take the '_Leaps in the grave_' to be an action intended for
Laertes by the Poet. His 'Hold off the earth a while,' does not
necessarily imply that the body is already in the grave. He has before
said, 'Lay her i'th' earth': then it was not in the grave. It is just
about to be lowered, when, with that cry of 'Hold off the earth a
while,' he jumps into the grave, and taking the corpse, on a bier at the
side of it, in his arms, calls to the spectators to pile a mountain on
them--in the wild speech that brings out Hamlet. The quiet dignity of
Hamlet's speech does not comport with his jumping into the grave:
Laertes comes out of the grave, and flies at Hamlet's throat. So, at
least, I would have the thing acted.

There is, however, nothing in the text to show that Laertes comes out of
the grave, and if the manager insist on the traditional mode, I would
suggest that the grave be represented much larger. In Mr. Jewitt's book
on Grave-Mounds, I read of a 'female skeleton in a grave six feet deep,
ten feet long, and eight feet wide.' Such a grave would give room for
both beside the body, and dismiss the hideousness of the common
representation.]

[Footnote 2: --_springing out of the grave and flying at Hamlet_.]

[Footnote 3: Note the temper, self-knowledge, self-government, and
self-distrust of Hamlet.]

[Footnote 4: The eyelids last of all become incapable of motion.]

[Footnote 5: That he loved her is the only thing to explain the
harshness of his behaviour to her. Had he not loved her and not been
miserable about her, he would have been as polite to her as well bred
people would have him.]

[Footnote 6: The gallants of Shakspere's day would challenge each other
to do more disagreeable things than any of these in honour of their
mistresses.

Somner's _Saxon Dict._, 1659.--'Eisel (_Saxon), vinegar; verjuice; any

_1st Q_. 'Wilt drinke vp vessels.' The word _up_ very likely implies the
steady emptying of a vessel specified--at a draught, and not by
degrees.]

[Footnote 7: --pretending care over Hamlet.]

[Footnote 8: Emphasis on _Be_, which I take for the _imperative mood_.]

[Footnote 9: The moment it is uttered, he recognizes and confesses to
the rant, ashamed of it even under the cover of his madness. It did not
belong _altogether_ to the madness. Later he expresses to Horatio his
regret in regard to this passage between him and Laertes, and afterwards
apologizes to Laertes. 252, 262.

Perhaps this is the speech in all the play of which it is most difficult
to get into a sympathetic comprehension. The student must call to mind
the elements at war in Hamlet's soul, and generating discords in his
behaviour: to those comes now the shock of Ophelia's death; the last tie
that bound him to life is gone--the one glimmer of hope left him for
this world! The grave upon whose brink he has been bandying words with
the sexton, is for _her_! Into such a consciousness comes the rant of
Laertes. Only the forms of madness are free to him, while no form is too
strong in which to repudiate indifference to Ophelia: for her sake, as
well as to relieve his own heart, he casts the clear confession of his
love into her grave. He is even jealous, over her dead body, of her
brother's profession of love to her--as if any brother could love as he
loved! This is foolish, no doubt, but human, and natural to a certain
childishness in grief. 252.

Add to this, that Hamlet--see later in his speeches to Osricke--had a
lively inclination to answer a fool according to his folly (256), to
outherod Herod if Herod would rave, out-euphuize Euphues himself if he
would be ridiculous:--the digestion of all these things in the retort of
meditation will result, I would fain think, in an understanding and
artistic justification of even this speech of Hamlet: the more I
consider it the truer it seems. If proof be necessary that real feeling
is mingled in the madness of the utterance, it may be found in the fact
that he is immediately ashamed of its extravagance.]

_Hor._ Ist possible?

_Ham._ Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:

[Footnote 1: I would suggest that the one paper, which he has just
shown, is a commission the king gave to himself; the other, which he is
about to show, that given to Rosincrance and Guildensterne. He is
setting forth his proof of the king's treachery.]

[Footnote 2: --of the king's words and behaviour, possibly, in giving
him his papers, Horatio having been present; or it might mean, 'Have you
got the things I have just told you clear in your mind?']

[Footnote 3: '--as if I could forget a single particular of it!']

[Footnote 4: The _Shaping Divinity_ was moving him.]

[Footnote 5: The fetters called _bilboes_ fasten a couple of mutinous
sailors together by the legs.]

[Footnote 6: Does he not here check himself and begin
afresh--remembering that the praise belongs to the Divinity?]

[Footnote 7: _pall_--from the root of _pale_--'come to nothing.' He had
had his plots from which he hoped much; the king's commission had
rendered them futile. But he seems to have grown doubtful of his plans
before, probably through the doubt of his companions which led him to
seek acquaintance with their commission, and he may mean that his 'dear
plots' had begun to pall _upon him_. Anyhow the sudden 'indiscretion' of
searching for and unsealing the ambassadors' commission served him as
nothing else could have served him.]

[Footnote 8: --even by our indiscretion. Emphasis on _shapes_.]

[Footnote 9: Here is another sign of Hamlet's religion. 24, 125, 260.
We start to work out an idea, but the result does not correspond with
the idea: another has been at work along with us. We rough-hew--block
out our marble, say for a Mercury; the result is an Apollo. Hamlet had
rough-hewn his ends--he had begun plans to certain ends, but had he been
allowed to go on shaping them alone, the result, even had he carried out
his plans and shaped his ends to his mind, would have been failure.
Another mallet and chisel were busy shaping them otherwise from the
first, and carrying them out to a true success. For _success_ is not the
success of plans, but the success of ends.]

[Footnote 10: Emphasize _I_ and _them_, as the rhythm requires, and the
phrase becomes picturesque.]

[Footnote 11: 'got my fingers on their papers.']

but in carrying out.]

[Footnote 4: statesmen.]

[Footnote 5: '_Yeomen of the guard of the king's body_ were anciently
two hundred and fifty men, of the best rank under gentry, and of larger
stature than ordinary; every one being required to be six feet
high.'--_E. Chambers' Cyclopaedia_. Hence '_yeoman's_ service' must mean
the very best of service.]

[Footnote 6: Note our common phrase: 'I wrote to this effect.']

[Footnote 7: 'as he would have Peace stand between their friendships
like a comma between two words.' Every point has in it a conjunctive, as
well as a disjunctive element: the former seems the one regarded
here--only that some amities require more than a comma to separate them.
The _comma_ does not make much of a figure--is good enough for its
position, however; if indeed the fact be not, that, instead of standing
for _Peace_, it does not even stand for itself, but for some other word.
I do not for my part think so.]

[Footnote 8: Dr. Johnson says there is a quibble here with _asses_ as
beasts of _charge_ or burden. It is probable enough, seeing, as Malone
tells us, that in Warwickshire, as did Dr. Johnson himself, they
pronounce _as_ hard. In Aberdeenshire the sound of the _s_ varies with
the intent of the word: '_az_ he said'; '_ass_ strong _az_ a horse.']

[Footnote 9: To what purpose is this half-voyage to England made part of
the play? The action--except, as not a few would have it, the very
action be delay--is nowise furthered by it; Hamlet merely goes and
returns.

To answer this question, let us find the real ground for Hamlet's
reflection, 'There's a Divinity that shapes our ends.' Observe, he is
set at liberty without being in the least indebted to the finding of the
commission--by the attack, namely, of the pirate; and this was not the
shaping of his ends of which he was thinking when he made the
reflection, for it had reference to the finding of the commission. What
then was the ground of the reflection? And what justifies the whole
passage in relation to the Poet's object, the character of Hamlet?

This, it seems to me:--

Although Hamlet could not have had much doubt left with regard to his
uncle's guilt, yet a man with a fine, delicate--what most men would
think, because so much more exacting than theirs--fastidious conscience,
might well desire some proof more positive yet, before he did a deed so
repugnant to his nature, and carrying in it such a loud condemnation of
his mother. And more: he might well wish to have something to _show_: a
man's conviction is no proof, though it may work in others inclination
to receive proof. Hamlet is sent to sea just to get such proof as will
not only thoroughly satisfy himself, but be capable of being shown to
others. He holds now in his hand--to lay before the people--the two
contradictory commissions. By his voyage then he has gained both
assurance of his duty, and provision against the consequence he mainly
dreaded, that of leaving a wounded name behind him. 272. This is the
shaping of his ends--so exactly to his needs, so different from his
rough-hewn plans--which is the work of the Divinity. The man who desires
to know his duty that he may _do_ it, who will not shirk it when he does
know it, will have time allowed him and the thing made plain to him; his
perplexity will even strengthen and purify his will. The weak man is he
who, certain of what is required of him, fails to meet it: so never once
fails Hamlet. Note, in all that follows, that a load seems taken off
him: after a gracious tardiness to believe up to the point of action, he
is at length satisfied. Hesitation belongs to the noble nature, to
Hamlet; precipitation to the poor nature, to Laertes, the son of
Polonius. Compare Brutus in _Julius Caesar_--a Hamlet in favourable
circumstances, with Hamlet--a Brutus in the most unfavourable
circumstances conceivable.]

own behaviour;' or, 'they have _crept into_ their fate by their
underhand dealings.' The _Sh. Lex._ explains _insinuation_ as
_meddling_.]

[Footnote 4: With the concern of Horatio for the fate of Rosincrance and
Guildensterne, Hamlet shows no sympathy. It has been objected to his
character that there is nothing in the play to show them privy to the
contents of their commission; to this it would be answer enough, that
Hamlet is satisfied of their worthlessness, and that their whole
behaviour in the play shows them merest parasites; but, at the same
time, we must note that, in changing the commission, he had no
intention, could have had no thought, of letting them go to England
without him: that was a pure shaping of their ends by the Divinity.
Possibly his own 'dear plots' had in them the notion of getting help
against his uncle from the king of England, in which case he would
willingly of course have continued his journey; but whatever they may be
supposed to have been, they were laid in connection with the voyage, not
founded on the chance of its interruption. It is easy to imagine a man
like him, averse to the shedding of blood, intending interference for
their lives: as heir apparent, he would certainly have been listened to.
The tone of his reply to Horatio is that of one who has been made the
unintending cause of a deserved fate: the thing having fallen out so,
the Divinity having so shaped their ends, there was nothing in their
character, any more than in that of Polonius, to make him regret their
death, or the part he had had in it.]

[Footnote 6: Perhaps, as Hamlet talked, he has been parenthetically
glancing at the real commission. Anyhow conviction is growing stronger
in Horatio, whom, for the occasion, we may regard as a type of the
public.]

[Footnote 7: 'thinkst thee,' in the fashion of the Friends, or 'thinke
thee' in the sense of 'bethink thee.']

[Footnote 8: 'Does it not rest now on me?--is it not now my duty?--is it
not _incumbent on me_ (with _lie_ for _stand_)--"is't not perfect
conscience"?']

[Footnote 9: Note '_my king_' not _my father_: he had to avenge a crime
against the state, the country, himself as a subject--not merely a
private wrong.]

For by the image of my Cause, I see
[Sidenote: 262] The Portraiture of his;[11] Ile count his fauours:[12]

[Footnote 1: Here is the charge at length in full against the king--of
quality and proof sufficient now, not merely to justify, but to compel
action against him.]

[Footnote 2: He was such a _fine_ hypocrite that Hamlet, although he
hated and distrusted him, was perplexed as to the possibility of his
guilt. His good acting was almost too much for Hamlet himself. This is
his 'coozenage.'

After 'coozenage' should come a dash, bringing '--is't not perfect
conscience' (_is it not absolutely righteous_) into closest sequence,
almost apposition, with 'Does it not stand me now upon--'.]

[Footnote 3: Here comes in the _Quarto, 'Enter a Courtier_.' All from
this point to 'Peace, who comes heere?' included, is in addition to the
_Quarto_ text--not in the _Q._, that is.]

[Footnote 4: I would here refer my student to the soliloquy--with its
_sea of troubles_, and _the taking of arms against it_. 123, n. 4.]

[Footnote 5: These three questions: 'Does it not stand me now
upon?'--'Is't not perfect conscience?'--'Is't not to be damned?' reveal
the whole relation between the inner and outer, the unseen and the seen,
the thinking and the acting Hamlet. 'Is not the thing right?--Is it not
my duty?--Would not the neglect of it deserve damnation?' He is
satisfied.]

[Footnote 6: 'is it not a thing to be damned--to let &c.?' or, 'would it
not be to be damned, (to be in a state of damnation, or, to bring
damnation on oneself) to let this human cancer, the king, go on to
further evil?']

[Footnote 7: '--so you have not much time.']

[Footnote 8: 'True, it will be short, but till then is mine, and will be
long enough for me.' He is resolved.]

[Footnote 9: Now that he is assured of what is right, the Shadow that
waits him on the path to it, has no terror for him. He ceases to be
anxious as to 'what dreams may come,' as to the 'something after death,'
as to 'the undiscovered country,' the moment his conscience is
satisfied. 120. It cannot now make a coward of him. It was never in
regard to the past that Hamlet dreaded death, but in regard to the
righteousness of the action which was about to occasion his death. Note
that he expects death; at least he has long made up his mind to the
great risk of it--the death referred to in the soliloquy--which, after
all, was not that which did overtake him. There is nothing about suicide
here, nor was there there.]

[Footnote 10: 'a man's life must soon be over anyhow.']

[Footnote 11: The approach of death causes him to think of and regret
even the small wrongs he has done; he laments his late behaviour to
Laertes, and makes excuse for him: the similarity of their condition,
each having lost a father by violence, ought, he says, to have taught
him gentleness with him. The _1st Quarto_ is worth comparing here:--

    _Enter Hamlet and Horatio_

    _Ham_. Beleeue mee, it greeues mee much _Horatio_,
    That to _Leartes_ I forgot my selfe:
    For by my selfe me thinkes I feele his griefe,
    Though there's a difference in each others wrong.]

[Footnote 12: 'I will not forget,' or, 'I will call to mind, what merits
he has,' or 'what favours he has shown me.' But I suspect the word
'_count_' ought to be _court_.--He does court his favour when next they
meet--in lovely fashion. He has no suspicion of his enmity.]

[Sidenote: 242, 262] But sure the brauery[1] of his griefe did put me
Into a Towring passion.[2]

affection, he began at once--in keeping with his assumed character of
madman, but not the less in harmony with his feelings--to outrave him.]

not really go on his head.]

take the place of the passage omitted, and connect the edges of the
gap.]

[Footnote 3: So far from having envied Laertes' reputation for fencing,
as the king asserts, Hamlet seems not even to have known which was
Laertes' weapon.]

[Footnote 4: laid down--staked.]

[Footnote 5: This and the following passages seem omitted for
curtailment, and perhaps in part because they were less amusing when the
fashion of euphuism had passed. The good of holding up the mirror to
folly was gone when it was no more the 'form and pressure' of 'the very
age and body of the time.']

which a ship deviates from the line of her course towards the right or
left in steering.' Falconer's _Marine Dictionary_. The meaning seems to
be that the inventorial description could not overtake his merits,
because it would _yaw_--keep turning out of the direct line of their
quick sail. But Hamlet is set on using far-fetched and absurd forms and
phrases to the non-plussing of Osricke, nor cares much to be _correct_.]

occasion; it uas never surely in _use_ for _substance_.]

says: 'why is this all----you call it --? --?' as if he wanted to use

asks for it, saying '_you call it_' interrogatively.]

contempt;--'as if _you_ knew anything of duty!'--for we see from what
follows that he is playing with the word _duty_. Or we might read it,
'Yours commends yours,' with the same sense as the reading of the _Q._,
which is, 'Yours,' that is, '_Your_ lordship--does well to commend his
duty himself--there is no one else to do it.' This former shape is
simpler; that of the _Folio_ is burdened with ellipsis--loaded with
lack. And surely _turne_ is the true reading!--though we may take the
other to mean, 'there are no tongues else on the side of his tongue.']

[Footnote A: _Here in the Quarto:--_

_Enter a Lord_.[15]

_Lord_. My Lord, his Maiestie commended him to you by young
Ostricke,[16] who brings backe to him that you attend him in the hall,
he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with _Laertes_, or that
you will take longer time?[17]

_Ham_. I am constant to my purposes, they followe the Kings pleasure,
if his fitnes speakes, mine is ready[18]: now or whensoeuer, prouided I
be so able as now.

_Lord_. The King, and Queene, and all are comming downe.

_Ham_. In happy time.[19]

_Lord_. The Queene desires you to vse some gentle
entertainment[20] _Laertes_, before you fall to play.

_Ham_. Shee well instructs me.]

[Footnote 1: 'Well, he _is_ a young one!']

[Footnote 2: '_Com'ply_,' with accent on first syllable: _comply with_
means _pay compliments to, compliment_. See _Q._ reading: 'A did sir
with':--_sir_ here is a verb--_sir with_ means _say sir to_: 'he
_sirred, complied_ with his nurse's breast before &c.' Hamlet speaks in
mockery of the affected court-modes of speech and address, the fashion
of euphuism--a mechanical attempt at the poetic.]

[Footnote 3: _a flock of birds_--suggested by '_This Lapwing_.']

[Footnote 4: 'the mere mode.']

[Footnote 5: 'and external custom of intercourse.' But here too I rather
take the _Q._ to be right: 'They have only got the fashion of the time;
and, out of a habit of wordy conflict, (they have got) a collection of
tricks of speech,--a yesty, frothy mass, with nothing in it, which
carries them in triumph through the most foolish and fastidious (nice,
choice, punctilious, whimsical) judgments.' _Yesty_ I take to be right,
and _prophane_ (vulgar) to have been altered by the Poet to _fond_
(foolish); of _trennowed_ I can make nothing beyond a misprint.]

[Footnote 6: Hamlet had just blown Osricke to his trial in his chosen
kind, and the bubble had burst. The braggart gentleman had no faculty to
generate after the dominant fashion, no invention to support his
ambition--had but a yesty collection, which failing him the moment
something unconventional was wanted, the fool had to look a discovered
fool.]

[Footnote 7: 'I shall win by the odds allowed me; he will not exceed me
three hits.']

[Footnote 8: He has a presentiment of what is coming.]

[Footnote 9: Nothing in this world is of much consequence to him now.
Also, he believes in 'a special Providence.']

[Footnote 10: 'a yielding, a sinking' at the heart? The _Sh. Lex._ says
_misgiving_.]

[Footnote 11: 'obey the warning.']

[Footnote 12: 'go to them before they come here'--'_prevent_ their
coming.']

[Footnote 13: The knowledge, even, of what is to come could never, any
more than ordinary expediency, be the _law_ of a man's conduct. St.
Paul, informed by the prophet Agabus of the troubles that awaited him at
Jerusalem, and entreated by his friends not to go thither, believed the
prophet, and went on to Jerusalem to be delivered into the hands of the
Gentiles.]

later, under the wing of the king.]

Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,

His madnesse is poore _Hamlets_ Enemy.[11]
Sir, in this Audience,[12]

And hurt my Mother.[15]                         [Sidenote: brother.[15]]

[Footnote 1: 'it'--death, the end.]

[Footnote 2: His father had been taken unready. 54.]

[Footnote 3: _Point_: 'all. Since'; 'leaves, what'--'Since no man has
anything of what he has left, those who left it late are in the same
position as those who left it early.' Compare the common saying, 'It
will be all the same in a hundred years.' The _Q._ reading comes much to
the same thing--'knows of ought he leaves'--'has any knowledge of it,
anything to do with it, in any sense possesses it.'

We may find a deeper meaning in the passage, however--surely not too
deep for Shakspere:--'Since nothing can be truly said to be possessed as
his own which a man must at one time or another yield; since that which
is _own_ can never be taken from the owner, but solely that which is
lent him; since the nature of a thing that has to be left is not such
that it _could_ be possessed, why should a man mind parting with it
early?'--There is far more in this than merely that at the end of the
day it will be all the same. The thing that ever was really a man's own,
God has given, and God will not, and man cannot, take away. Note the
unity of religion and philosophy in Hamlet: he takes the one true
position. Note also his courage: he has a strong presentiment of death,
but will not turn a step from his way. If Death be coming, he will
confront him. He does not believe in chance. He is ready--that is
willing. All that is needful is, that he should not go as one who cannot
help it, but as one who is for God's will, who chooses that will as his
own.

There is so much behind in Shakspere's characters--so much that can only
be hinted at! The dramatist has not the _word_-scope of the novelist;
his art gives him little _room_; he must effect in a phrase what the
other may take pages to. He needs good seconding by his actors as sorely
as the composer needs good rendering of his music by the orchestra. It
is a lesson in unity that the greatest art can least work alone; that
the greatest _finder_ most needs the help of others to show his
_findings_. The dramatist has live men and women for the very
instruments of his art--who must not be mere instruments, but
fellow-workers; and upon them he is greatly dependent for final outcome.

Here the actor should show a marked calmness and elevation in Hamlet. He
should have around him as it were a luminous cloud, the cloud of his
coming end. A smile not all of this world should close the speech. He
has given himself up, and is at peace.]

[Footnote 4: Note in this apology the sweetness of Hamlet's nature. How
few are alive enough, that is unselfish and true enough, to be capable
of genuine apology! The low nature always feels, not the wrong, but the
confession of it, degrading.]

[Footnote 5: --the wrong of his rudeness at the funeral.]

[Footnote 6: all present.]

[Footnote 7: --true in a deeper sense than they would understand.]

[Footnote 8: 'that might roughly awake your nature, honour, and
exception,':--consider the phrase--_to take exception at a thing_.]

[Footnote 9: It was by cause of madness, not by cause of evil intent.
For all purpose of excuse it was madness, if only pretended madness; it
was there of another necessity, and excused offence like real madness.
What he said was true, not merely expedient, to the end he meant it to
serve. But all passion may be called madness, because therein the mind
is absorbed with one idea; 'anger is a brief madness,' and he was in a
'towering passion': he proclaims it madness and so abjures it.]

[Footnote 10: 'refuses the wrong altogether--will in his true self have
nothing to do with it.' No evil thing comes of our true selves, and
confession is the casting of it from us, the only true denial. He who
will not confess a wrong, holds to the wrong.]

[Footnote 11: All here depends on the expression in the utterance.]

[Footnote 12: _This line not in Q._]

[Footnote 13: This is Hamlet's summing up of the whole--his explanation
of the speech.]

[Footnote 14: 'so far as this in your generous judgment--that you regard
me as having shot &c.']

[Footnote 15: _Brother_ is much easier to accept, though _Mother_ might
be in the simile.

To do justice to the speech we must remember that Hamlet has no quarrel
whatever with Laertes, that he has expressed admiration of him, and that
he is inclined to love him for Ophelia's sake. His apology has no
reference to the fate of his father or his sister; Hamlet is not aware
that Laertes associates him with either, and plainly the public did not
know Hamlet killed Polonius; while Laertes could have no intention of
alluding to the fact, seeing it would frustrate his scheme of
treachery.]

To keepe my name vngorg'd.[2] But till that time,

Cousen _Hamlet_, you know the wager.

_Ham_. Verie well my Lord,
Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th'weaker side,        [Sidenote: has]

_King._ I do not feare it,
I haue seene you both:[9]
But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes.[10]
                                                  [Sidenote: better, we]

[Footnote 1: 'in my own feelings and person.' Laertes does not refer to
his father or sister. He professes to be satisfied in his heart with
Hamlet's apology for his behaviour at the funeral, but not to be sure
whether in the opinion of others, and by the laws of honour, he can
accept it as amends, and forbear to challenge him. But the words 'Whose
motiue in this case should stirre me most to my Reuenge' may refer to
his father and sister, and, if so taken, should be spoken aside. To
accept apology for them and not for his honour would surely be too
barefaced! The point concerning them has not been started.

But why not receive the apology as quite satisfactory? That he would not
seems to show a lingering regard to _real_ honour. A downright villain,
like the king, would have pretended its _thorough_
acceptance--especially as they were just going to fence like friends;
but he, as regards his honour, will not accept it until justified in
doing so by the opinion of 'some elder masters,' receiving from them 'a
voice and precedent of peace'--counsel to, and justification, or example
of peace. He keeps the door of quarrel open--will not profess to be
_altogether_ friends with him, though he does not hint at his real
ground of offence: that mooted, the match of skill, with its immense
advantages for villainy, would have been impossible. He means treachery
all the time; careful of his honour, he can, like most apes of fashion,
let his honesty go; still, so complex is human nature, he holds his
speech declining thorough reconciliation as a shield to shelter his
treachery from his own contempt: he has taken care not to profess
absolute friendship, and so left room for absolute villainy! He has had
regard to his word! Relieved perhaps by the demoniacal quibble, he
follows it immediately with an utterance of full-blown perfidy.]

[Footnote 2: Perhaps _ungorg'd_ might mean _unthrottled_.]

[Footnote 3: 'Come on' _is not in the Q._--I suspect this _Come on_ but
a misplaced shadow from the '_Come one_' immediately below, and better
omitted. Hamlet could not say '_Come on_' before Laertes was ready, and
'_Come one_' after 'Give us the foils,' would be very awkward. But it
may be said to the attendant courtiers.]

[Footnote 4: He says this while Hamlet is still choosing, in order that
a second bundle of foils, in which is the unbated and poisoned one, may
be brought him. So 'generous and free from all contriving' is Hamlet,
(220) that, even with the presentiment in his heart, he has no fear of
treachery.]

[Footnote 5: As persons of the drama, the Poet means Laertes to be foil
to Hamlet.--With the play upon the word before us, we can hardly help
thinking of the _third_ signification of the word _foil_.]

[Footnote 6: 'My ignorance will be the foil of darkest night to the
burning star of your skill.' This is no flattery; Hamlet believes
Laertes, to whose praises he has listened (218)--though not with the
envy his uncle attributes to him--the better fencer: he expects to win
only 'at the odds.' 260.]

[Footnote 7: --not '_by these pickers and stealers_,' his oath to his
false friends. 154.]

[Footnote 8: Plainly a favourite with the king.--He is _Ostricke_ always
in the _Q_.]

[Footnote 9: 'seen you both play'--though not together.]

[Footnote 10: _Point thus_:

    I do not fear it--I have seen you both!
    But since, he is bettered: we have therefore odds.

'Since'--'_since the time I saw him_.']

is quite like Hamlet to take even Osricke's word for their equal
length.]

[Footnote 4: 'or be quits with Laertes the third bout':--in any case,
whatever the probabilities, even if Hamlet be wounded, the king, who has
not perfect confidence in the 'unction,' will fall back on his second
line of ambush--in which he has more trust: he will drink to Hamlet,
when Hamlet will be bound to drink also.]

showing nor entertaining suspicion, fearing only the effect of the
draught on his play. He is bent on winning the wager--perhaps with
further intent.]

recoils a little.]

[Footnote 7: He has compunctions, but it needs failure to make them
potent.]

[Footnote 8: 'treat me as an effeminate creature.']

[Footnote 9: He makes a sudden attack, without warning of the fourth
bout.]

[Footnote 10: _Not in Q._

The 1st Q. directs:--_They catch one anothers Rapiers, find both are
wounded_, &c.

The thing, as I understand it, goes thus: With the words 'Have at you
now!' Laertes stabs Hamlet; Hamlet, apprised thus of his treachery, lays
hold of his rapier, wrenches it from him, and stabs him with it in
return.]

[Footnote 11: 'they have lost their temper.']

[Footnote 12: --said with indignation and scorn, but without suspicion
of the worst.]

[Footnote 13: --the proverbially foolish bird. The speech must be spoken
with breaks. Its construction is broken.]

[Footnote 14: His conscience starts up, awake and strong, at the
approach of Death. As the show of the world withdraws, the realities
assert themselves. He repents, and makes confession of his sin, seeing
it now in its true nature, and calling it by its own name. It is a
compensation of the weakness of some that they cannot be strong in
wickedness. The king did not so repent, and with his strength was the
more to blame.]

[Footnote 7: _Not in Quarto._

The true moment, now only, has at last come. Hamlet has lived to do his
duty with a clear conscience, and is thereupon permitted to go. The man
who asks whether this be poetic justice or no, is unworthy of an answer.
'The Tragedie of Hamlet' is _The Drama of Moral Perplexity_.]

[Footnote 8: A grim play on the word _Union: 'follow my mother_'. It
suggests a terrible meeting below.]

[Footnote 9: _Not in Quarto._]

[Footnote 10: His better nature triumphs. The moment he was wounded,
knowing he must die, he began to change. Defeat is a mighty aid to
repentance; and processes grow rapid in the presence of Death: he
forgives and desires forgiveness.]

[Footnote 11: _Not in Quarto._]

[Footnote 12: Note how heartily Hamlet pardons the wrong done to
himself--the only wrong of course which a man has to pardon.]

Goodnight sweet Prince,
And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,
Why do's the Drumme come hither?

[Footnote 1: His care over his reputation with the people is princely,
and casts a true light on his delay. No good man can be willing to seem
bad, except the _being good_ necessitates it. A man must be willing to
appear a villain if that is the consequence of being a true man, but he
cannot be indifferent to that appearance. He cannot be indifferent to
wearing the look of the thing he hates. Hamlet, that he may be
understood by the nation, makes, with noble confidence in his
friendship, the large demand on Horatio, to live and suffer for his
sake.]

[Footnote 2: Here first we see plainly the love of Horatio for Hamlet:
here first is Hamlet's judgment of Horatio (134) justified.]

[Footnote 3: --for having killed his uncle:--what, then, if he had slain
him at once?]

[Footnote 4: Horatio must be represented as here giving sign of assent.

    What tongue should tell the story of our deaths,
    If not from thee?]

[Footnote 5: _Not in Q._]

[Footnote 6: The frame is closing round the picture. 9.]

[Footnote 7: Shakspere more than once or twice makes the dying
prophesy.]

[Footnote 8: His last thought is for his country; his last effort at
utterance goes to prevent a disputed succession.]

[Footnote 9: 'greater and less'--as in the psalm,

    'The Lord preserves all, more and less,
      That bear to him a loving heart.']

[Footnote 11: _These interjections are not in the Quarto._]

off the stage of the world on to another.]

[Footnote 6: This line may be taken as a parenthesis; then--'come too

'to tell him':--'the ears that should give us hearing in order that we
might tell him' etc.]

_opportunely--fittingly_.]

[Footnote 12: --addressed to Fortinbras, I should say. The state is
disrupt, the household in disorder; there is no head; Horatio turns
therefore to Fortinbras, who, besides having a claim to the crown, and
being favoured by Hamlet, alone has power at the moment--for his army is
with him.]

[Footnote 13: --those of Claudius.]

[Footnote 14: 'just judgments brought about by accident'--as in the case
of all slain except the king, whose judgment was not accidental, and
Hamlet, whose death was not a judgment.]

Rosincrance, Guildensterne, and Laertes.]

[Footnote 17: --those of the king and Polonius.]

[Footnote 18: 'and in this result'--_pointing to the bodies_--'purposes
which have mistaken their way, and fallen on the inventors' heads.' _I
am mistaken_ or _mistook_, means _I have mistaken_; 'purposes
mistooke'--_purposes in themselves mistaken_:--that of Laertes, which
came back on himself; and that of the king in the matter of the poison,
which, by falling on the queen, also came back on the inventor.]

[Footnote 19: The _Quarto_ is correct here, I think: '_rights of the
past_'--'claims of descent.' Or 'rights of memory' might mean--'_rights
yet remembered_.'

Fortinbras is not one to miss a chance: even in this shadowy 'person,'
character is recognizably maintained.]

[Footnote 2: The _Quarto_ surely is right here.]

[Footnote 3: --Hamlet's mouth. The message he entrusted to Horatio for
Fortinbras, giving his voice, or vote, for him, was sure to 'draw on

and mistakes.']

[Footnote 5: 'had he been put forward'--_had occasion sent him out_.]

[Footnote 6: 'to have proved a most royal soldier:'--A soldier gives
here his testimony to Hamlet's likelihood in the soldier's calling. Note
the kind of regard in which the Poet would show him held.]

[Footnote 7: --the passage of his spirit to its place.]

[Footnote 8: --military mourning or funeral rites.]

[Footnote 9: _imperative mood_: 'let the soldier's music and the rites
of war speak loudly for him.' 'Go, bid the souldiers shoote,' with which
the drama closes, is a more definite initiatory order to the same
effect.]

[Footnote 10: The end is a half-line after a riming couplet--as if there
were more to come--as there must be after every tragedy. Mere poetic
justice will not satisfy Shakspere in a tragedy, for tragedy is _life_;
in a comedy it may do well enough, for that deals but with
life-surfaces--and who then more careful of it! but in tragedy something
far higher ought to be aimed at. The end of this drama is reached when
Hamlet, having attained the possibility of doing so, performs his work
_in righteousness_. The common critical mind would have him left the
fatherless, motherless, loverless, almost friendless king of a
justifiably distrusting nation--with an eternal grief for his father
weighing him down to the abyss; with his mother's sin blackening for him
all womankind, and blasting the face of both heaven and earth; and with
the knowledge in his heart that he had sent the woman he loved, with her
father and her brother, out of the world--maniac, spy, and traitor.
Instead of according him such 'poetic justice,' the Poet gives Hamlet
the only true success of doing his duty to the end--for it was as much
his duty not to act before, as it was his duty to act at last--then
sends him after his Ophelia--into a world where true heart will find
true way of setting right what is wrong, and of atoning for every ill,
wittingly or unwittingly done or occasioned in this.

It seems to me most admirable that Hamlet, being so great, is yet
outwardly so like other people: the Poet never obtrudes his greatness.
And just because he is modest, confessing weakness and perplexity, small
people take him for yet smaller than themselves who never confess
anything, and seldom feel anything amiss with them. Such will adduce
even Hamlet's disparagement of himself to Ophelia when overwhelmed with
a sense of human worthlessness (126), as proof that he was no hero!
They call it weakness that he would not, foolishly and selfishly, make
good his succession against the king, regardless of the law of election,
and careless of the weal of the kingdom for which he shows himself so
anxious even in the throes of death! To my mind he is the grandest hero
in fiction--absolutely human--so troubled, yet so true!]

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689

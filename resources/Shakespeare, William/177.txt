PREFACE.


I. SHAKESPEARE'S KING JOHN was printed for the first time in the Folio
of 1623. The poet adopted most of the characters, the general plot, and
occasional lines, or fragments of lines, from an earlier play, in two
parts, published in 1591, with the following title-page:

The | Troublesome Raigne | of _Iohn_ King of _England_, with the
dis-|_couerie of King_ Richard Cordelions | Base sonne (vulgarly named,
The Ba-|stard Fawconbridge): _also the_ | death of King _Iohn_ at
_Swinstead_ | _Abbey._ | _As it was (sundry times) publikely acted
by the_ | _Queenes Maiesties Players, in the ho-_|_nourable Citie of
London._ | Imprinted at London for _Sampson Clarke_, | _and are to
be solde at his shop, on the backe-_|side of the _Royall Exchange_. |
1591. |

This play was reprinted for a different bookseller in 1611, with the
words 'W. Sh.' added to the title; and a third edition in 1622, again
issued by a different bookseller, has 'W. Shakespeare.'

There can be little doubt that the booksellers attributed the play to
Shakespeare in the hope that so popular a name might help the sale, for
although the earlier play is by no means devoid of merit, the evidence
of its style conclusively proves that Shakespeare had no part in the
authorship. We have therefore not reprinted it, but contented ourselves
with indicating the passages borrowed verbally from it.

2. Of RICHARD II. four editions in Quarto were published before the
appearance of the first Folio:

Q₁. The | Tragedie of King Ri-|chard the se-|cond. | _As it hath
beene publikely acted_ | _by the right Honourable the_ | _Lorde
Chamberlaine his Ser'uants._ | LONDON | Printed by Valentine Simmes
for Andrew Wise, and | are to be sold at his shop in Paules church yard
at | the signe of the Angel. | 1597. |

Q₂. The | Tragedie of King Ri-|chard the second. | As it hath beene
publikely acted by the Right Ho-|nourable the Lord Chamberlaine his |
seruants. | _By William Shake-speare._ | LONDON | Printed by Valentine
Simmes for Andrew Wise, and | are to be sold at his shop in Paules
churchyard at | the signe of the Angel. | 1598. |

Q₃. The | Tragedie of King | Richard the second. | As it hath been
publikely acted by the Right | Honourable the Lord Chamberlaine |
his seruantes. | By _William Shake-speare_. | LONDON, | Printed by
W. W. for _Mathew Law_, and are to be | sold at his shop in Paules
Church-yard, at | the signe of the Foxe. | 1608. |

The same edition was also issued in the same year with the following
title-page:

The | Tragedie of King | Richard the Second: | With new additions of
the Parlia-|ment Sceane, and the deposing | of King Richard, | As it
hath been lately acted by the Kinges | Maiesties seruantes, at the
Globe. | By _William Shake-speare_. | At London, | Printed by W. W. for
_Mathew Law_, and are to | be sold at his shop in Paules Church-yard, |
at the signe of the Foxe. | 1608. |

Q₄. The | Tragedie of King | Richard the Se-|cond: | _With new
additions of the Parliament Sceane_, | _and the deposing of King_ |
_Richard._ | As it hath been lately acted by the Kinges | Maiesties
seruants, at the Globe. | _By_ WILLIAM SHAKE-SPEARE. | At LONDON, |
Printed for _Mathew Law_, and are to be sold | at his shop in Paules
Church-yard, at the | signe of the Foxe. | 1615. |

Each of these Quartos was printed from its immediate predecessor. The
third however contains an important addition, found in all the extant
copies of Q₃, amounting to 165 lines, viz. IV. 1. 154-318. This is what
is meant by 'the new additions of the Parliament scene' mentioned in
the title-pages of some copies of Q₃ and in that of Q₄. These 'new
additions' are found also in the first and following Folios and in Q₅.
The play, as given in the first Folio, was no doubt printed from a copy
of Q₄, corrected with some care and prepared for stage representation.
Several passages have been left out with a view of shortening the
performance. In the 'new additions of the Parliament Scene' it would
appear that the defective text of the Quarto had been corrected from
the author's MS. For this part therefore the first Folio is our highest
authority: for all the rest of the play the first Quarto affords the
best text.

The fifth Quarto (Q₅) was printed from the second Folio (F₂), but its
readings sometimes agree with one or other of the earlier Quartos,
and in a few cases are entirely independent of previous editions. Its
title-page is as follows:

The | Life and | Death of King | Richard the | Second. | With new
Additions of the | _Parliament Scene_, and the | Deposing of King
_Richard_. | As it hath beene acted by the Kings Majesties | Servants,
at the _Globe_. | By _William Shakespeare_. | London, Printed by Iohn
Norton. | 1634. |

3. THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH appeared in six successive
Quarto editions before the publication of the first Folio. The
title-pages of the first five of these editions are given in full
below. The version in the first Folio seems to have been printed
from a partially corrected copy of the fifth Quarto. In many places
the readings coincide with those of the earlier Quartos, which were
probably consulted by the corrector. The title of the play in the Folio
is, 'The First Part of Henry the Fourth, with the Life and Death of
Henry Sirnamed Hotspurre.' As there is no copy of the fourth Quarto
in the Capell collection, our collation has been made from the copy
in the Bodleian, and verified by that in the Devonshire Library. The
deficiencies of Capell's copy of the third Quarto have been supplied by
a collation of the Bodleian copy of that edition.

Q₁. The | History of | Henrie the | Fovrth; | With the battell at
Shrewsburie, | _betweene the King and Lord_ | Henry Percy, surnamed |
Henrie Hotspur of | the North. | _With the humorous conceits of Sir_
| Iohn Falstalffe. | AT LONDON, | Printed by _P. S._ for _Andrew Wise_,
dwelling | in Paules Churchyard, at the signe of | the Angell. 1598. |

Q₂. The | History of | Henrie the | Fovrth; | With the battell at
Shrewsburie, | _betweene the King and Lord_ Henry | Percy, _surnamed_
Henry Hot-|spur of the North. | _With the humorous conceits of Sir_ |
Iohn Falstalffe. | Newly corrected by _W. Shakespeare_. | AT LONDON, |
Printed by _S. S._ for _Andrew Wise_, dwelling | in Paules Churchyard,
at the signe of | the Angell. 1599. |

Q₃. The | History of | Henrie the fourth, | With the battell at
Shrewsburie, | _betweene the King, and Lord_ | Henry Percy, surnamed
Henry Hot-|_spur of the North._ | _With the humorous conceits of Sir_
| Iohn Falstaffe. | Newly corrected by _W. Shakespeare_. | London |
Printed by Valentine Simmes, for _Mathew Law_, and | are to be solde
at his shop in Paules Churchyard, | at the signe of the Fox. | 1604. |

Q₄. The | History of | Henry the fourth, | With the battell at
Shrewseburie, | _betweene the King, and Lord_ | Henry Percy, surnamed
Henry | _Hotspur of the North._ | _With the humorous conceites of
Sir_ | Iohn Falstalffe. | _Newly corrected by W. Shake-speare._ |
London, | Printed for _Mathew Law_, and are to be sold at | his shop in
Paules Church-yard, neere vnto S. | Augustines gate, at the signe of |
the Foxe. 1608. |

Q₅. The | History of | Henrie the fourth, | With the Battell at
Shrewseburie, betweene | the King, and Lord Henrie Percy, sur-| named
_Henrie Hotspur_ of the North. | With the humorous conceites of Sir |
_Iohn Falstaffe_. | Newly corrected by _W. Shakespeare._ | LONDON, |
Printed by W. W. for _Mathew Law_, and are to be sold | at his shop in
Paules Church-yard, neere vnto S. | _Augustines_ Gate, at the signe of
the Foxe. | 1613. |

Subsequent editions in Quarto were printed in 1622 (Q₆) by T. P. for
Mathew Law, in 1632 (Q₇) by John Norton for William Sheares, and in
1639 (Q₈) by John Norton for Hugh Perry. In all these the title-page is
substantially the same. Each Quarto appears to have been printed from
its predecessor.

The 'Dering MS.' quoted in our foot-notes was discovered in the
muniment room at Surrenden by the Rev. Lambert B. Larking in 1844,
and published in the following year for the Shakespeare Society
under the editorship of Mr Halliwell. It contains a large portion of
the First Part of Henry IV. and some scenes of the Second Part. Mr
Halliwell believes it to have been written in the early part of the
17th century, certainly earlier than 1640, for the purpose of private
theatrical performance. Some additions and corrections were made by
the hand of 'Sir Edward Deryng, the first baronet, who died in 1644.'
(_Introduction_, p. xii. ed. 1845.)

We are of opinion that this MS. was copied from the fifth Quarto of the
First Part, and from a complete Quarto of the Second Part. The writer
seems to have been both illiterate and careless. His punctuation is
singularly bad, and his spelling peculiar to himself. We have noticed
such various readings as seemed in any way remarkable.

4. THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH was first published in
Quarto in 1600 with the following title-page:

THE | Second part of Henrie | the fourth, continuing to his death,
| _and coronation of Henrie_ | the fift. | With the humours of sir
Iohn Fal-| _staffe, and swaggering_ | Pistoll. | _As it hath been
sundrie times publikely_ | acted by the right honourable, the Lord |
Chamberlaine his seruants. | _Written by William Shakespeare._ | LONDON
| Printed by V. S. for Andrew Wise, and | William Aspley. | 1600. |

In some copies of the Quarto the first scene of Act III. is left out
altogether. The omission seems to have been discovered after part of
the edition had been struck off and rectified by the insertion of two
new leaves. In order to make this insertion, the type was taken to
pieces in part of the preceding and subsequent leaves, so that there
are two different impressions for the latter part of Act II. and the
beginning of Act III. Sc. 2. Where this difference occurs we have used
the symbols Q₁, and Q₂; where the two are identical we use only Q.

The version in the first Folio was probably printed from a transcript
of the original MS. It contains passages of considerable length which
are not found in the Quarto. Some of these are among the finest in
the play, and are too closely connected with the context to allow of
the supposition that they were later additions inserted by the author
after the publication of the Quarto. In the MS. from which that edition
was printed, these passages had been most likely omitted, or erased,
in order to shorten the play for the stage. The Folio in other places
affords occasional readings which seem preferable to those of the
Quarto, but for the most part the Quarto is to be regarded as having
the higher critical value.

5. KING HENRY THE FIFTH appears in its present form for the first
time in the Folio of 1623. An imperfect edition in quarto was printed
surreptitiously in 1600, with the following title:

(Q₁). The | Cronicle | History of Henry the fift, | With his battell
fought at _Agin Court_ in | France. Togither with _Auntient_ |
_Pistoll._ | _As it hath bene sundry times playd by the Right
honorable_ | _the Lord Chamberlaine his seruants._ | LONDON Printed by
_Thomas Creede_, for Tho. Milling-|ton, and Iohn Busby. And are to be |
sold at his house in Carter Lane, next | the Powle head. 1600. |

The text of this edition is given literatim at the end of the present
volume, with the readings of two reprints which appeared in 1602 and
1608 respectively. The title-pages of these are as follows:

(Q₂). The | Chronicle | History of Henry the fift, | With his battell
fought at _Agin Court_ | in _France_. Together with _Auntient_
| _Pistoll._ | _As it hath bene sundry times playd by the Right
honorable_ | _the Lord Chamberlaine his seruants._ | LONDON | Printed
by Thomas Creede, for Thomas | Pauier, and are to be sold at his
shop in Cornhill, | at the signe of the Cat and Parrets neare | the
Exchange. 1602. |

Q₃. The | Chronicle History | of Henry the fift, with his | battell
fought at _Agin Court_ in | France. Together with _an-_|_cient
Pistoll._ | _As it hath bene sundry times playd by the Right
Honou-_|_rable the Lord Chamberlaine his_ | _Seruants._ | Printed for
T. P. 1608. |

The text of these Quarto editions is so imperfect and varies so much
from the more authentic text of the Folio, that it was impossible to
give the variations in our foot-notes. We are inclined to agree with Mr
Collier and others in the supposition that the Quarto text was 'hastily
made up from notes taken at the theatre during the performance,
subsequently patched together.' The references to these Quartos are
inclosed in brackets in accordance with the rule mentioned in the
Preface to Vol. I. p. xxi.

It is scarcely necessary to add that 'The famous Victories of Henry the
Fift,' published in 1617, has nothing to do with Shakespeare's play.

We have the pleasure of adding several new names to the list of our
benefactors. Miss Thackeray, of Windsor, has been so kind as to lend
us a copy of Nares's Glossary which belonged to her late father, the
Provost of King's College, Cambridge, and is copiously annotated in his
hand.

Mr Henry Wilbraham has obtained for us the loan of some valuable MS.
notes on Shakespeare, compiled by the late Mr Roger Wilbraham, F.R.S.,
formerly Fellow of Trinity College, and now in the possession of Mr
George Fortescue Wilbraham of Delamere House, Cheshire.

Dr C. M. Ingleby and Mr G. R. French have sent us valuable
communications, the former with reference to difficulties in the text,
the latter with reference to points of history and genealogy.

We are also indebted for various acts of kindness and courtesy to the
Marquis Camden, the Rev. T. S. Woollaston, the Rev. Lambert B. Larking,
the Rev. Archibald Clerke of Kilmallie, Mr Stirling of Keir, Mr Pryme,
Mr W. B. Donne, Mr P. S. Worsley, Professor Goldwin Smith, the Rev.
H. O. Coxe, Librarian of the Bodleian, Mr C. Wright, and the late Mr

    _Chat._ Philip of France, in right and true behalf
    Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,[3]
    Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim[4]
    To this fair island and the territories,                             10
    To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,[5]
    Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
    Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
    And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
    Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.                                15

    _K. John._ What follows if we disallow of this?

    _Chat._ The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
    To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.

    _K. John._ Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
    Controlment for controlment: so answer France.[6]                    20

    _Chat._ Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
    The farthest limit of my embassy.

    _K. John._ Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
    Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
    For ere thou canst report I will be there,[7]                        25
    The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:
    So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
    And sullen presage of your own decay.[8]
    An honourable conduct let him have:
    Pembroke, look to't. Farewell, Chatillon.[9]                         30

                                       [_Exeunt Chatillon and Pembroke._

    _Eli._ What now, my son! have I not ever said
    How that ambitious Constance would not cease
    Till she had kindled France and all the world,
    Upon the right and party of her son?
    This might have been prevented and made whole                        35
    With very easy arguments of love,
    Which now the manage of two kingdoms must[10]
    With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.

    _K. John._ Our strong possession and our right for us.

    _Eli._ Your strong possession much more than your right,             40
    Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
    So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
    Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.

                         _Enter a_ Sheriff.[11]

    _Essex._ My liege, here is the strangest controversy
    Come from the country to be judged by you,                           45
    That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?

    _K. John._ Let them approach.
    Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
    This expedition's charge.

 _Enter_ ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE, _and_ PHILIP _his bastard brother_.[12]

                               What men are you?

    _Bast._ Your faithful subject I, a gentleman[13]                     50
    Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
    As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,[14]
    A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
    Of Cœur-de-lion knighted in the field.[15]

    _K. John._ What art thou?[16]                                        55

    _Rob._ The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.

    _K. John._ Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
    You came not of one mother then, it seems.

    _Bast._ Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
    That is well known; and, as I think, one father:                     60
    But for the certain knowledge of that truth
    I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
    Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.

    _Eli._ Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
    And wound her honour with this diffidence.                           65

    _Bast._ I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
    That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
    The which if he can prove, a' pops me out[17]
    At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
    Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!                         70

    _K. John._ A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
    Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?

    _Bast._ I know not why, except to get the land.
    But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
    But whether I be as true begot or no,[18]                            75
    That still I lay upon my mother's head;
    But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
    Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
    Compare our faces and be judge yourself.[19]
    If old Sir Robert did beget us both                                  80
    And were our father and this son like him,[20]
    O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee
    I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

    _K. John._ Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here![21]

    _Eli._ He hath a trick of Cœur-de-lion's face;[22]                   85
    The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
    Do you not read some tokens of my son
    In the large composition of this man?

    _K. John._ Mine eye hath well examined his parts
    And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,                       90
    What doth move you to claim your brother's land?

    _Bast._ Because he hath a half-face, like my father.[23]
    With half that face would he have all my land:[23][24]
    A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year![23]

    _Rob._ My gracious liege, when that my father lived,                 95
    Your brother did employ my father much,--

    _Bast._ Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
    Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.

    _Rob._ And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
    To Germany, there with the emperor                                  100
    To treat of high affairs touching that time.
    The advantage of his absence took the king
    And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
    Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
    But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores[25]            105
    Between my father and my mother lay,
    As I have heard my father speak himself,
    When this same lusty gentleman was got.
    Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
    His lands to me, and took it on his death[26]                       110
    That this my mother's son was none of his;
    And if he were, he came into the world[27]
    Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
    Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
    My father's land, as was my father's will.                          115

    _K. John._ Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
    Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
    And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
    Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands[28]
    That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,                       120
    Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
    Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
    In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
    This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
    In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,                   125
    My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
    Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
    My mother's son did get your father's heir;
    Your father's heir must have your father's land.

    _Rob._ Shall then my father's will be of no force                   130
    To dispossess that child which is not his?

    _Bast._ Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
    Than was his will to get me, as I think.

    _Eli._ Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge[29]
    And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,                            135
    Or the reputed son of Cœur-de-lion,
    Lord of thy presence and no land beside?[30]

    _Bast._ Madam, an if my brother had my shape,[31]
    And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;[32]
    And if my legs were two such riding-rods,[33]                       140
    My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
    That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
    Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
    And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,[34]
    Would I might never stir from off this place,                       145
    I would give it every foot to have this face;[35]
    I would not be sir Nob in any case.[36]

    _Eli._ I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
    Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
    I am a soldier and now bound to France.                             150

    _Bast._ Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
    Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
    Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
    Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.

    _Eli._ Nay, I would have you go before me thither.                  155

    _Bast._ Our country manners give our betters way.

    _K. John._ What is thy name?

    _Bast._ Philip, my liege, so is my name begun;
    Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.

    _K. John._ From henceforth bear his name whose form thou
        bear'st:[37]                                                    160
    Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,[38]
    Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.

    _Bast._ Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
    My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
    Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,                           165
    When I was got, sir Robert was away!

    _Eli._ The very spirit of Plantagenet!
    I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.[39]

    _Bast._ Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?[40]
    Something about, a little from the right,                           170
      In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
    Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
      And have is have, however men do catch:
    Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
    And I am I, howe'er I was begot.                                    175

    _K. John._ Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
    A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
    Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
    For France, for France, for it is more than need.

    _Bast._ Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!                  180
    For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.[41]

                                          [_Exeunt all but Bastard._[42]

    A foot of honour better than I was;
    But many a many foot of land the worse.[43]
    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
    'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--                  185
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable[44]
    For your conversion. Now your traveller,[45]
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,                          190
    And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'[46]
    Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
    'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;[47]                    195
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:[48]
    'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
    At your employment; at your service, sir:'
    'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
    And so, ere answer knows what question would,                       200
    Saving in dialogue of compliment,[49]
    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
    The Pyrenean and the river Po,[50]
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.[51]
    But this is worshipful society                                      205
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself,[52]
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation;[53]
    And so am I, whether I smack or no;[53][54]
    And not alone in habit and device,                                  210
    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    But from the inward motion to deliver
    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,[55]
    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;                              215
    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

             _Enter_ LADY FAULCONBRIDGE _and_ JAMES GURNEY.

    O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady![56]                      220
    What brings you here to court so hastily?

    _Lady F._ Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,[57]
    That holds in chase mine honour up and down?

    _Bast._ My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
    Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?                           225
    Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?

    _Lady F._ Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
    Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?[58]
    He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.

    _Bast._ James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?[59]           230

    _Gur._ Good leave, good Philip.

    _Bast._                          Philip! sparrow: James,[60]
    There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.   [_Exit Gurney._[61]
    Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
    Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
    Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:                          235
    Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,[62]
    Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:[63]
    We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
    To whom am I beholding for these limbs?[64]
    Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.[65]                         240

    _Lady F._ Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,[66]
    That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
    What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?

    _Bast._ Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.[67]
    What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.[68]                    245
    But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
    I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;
    Legitimation, name and all is gone:
    Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
    Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?                        250

    _Lady F._ Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?

    _Bast._ As faithfully as I deny the devil.

    _Lady F._ King Richard Cœur-de-lion was thy father:
    By long and vehement suit I was seduced
    To make room for him in my husband's bed:                           255
    Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge![69]
    Thou art the issue of my dear offence,[70]
    Which was so strongly urged past my defence.

    _Bast._ Now, by this light, were I to get again,
    Madam, I would not wish a better father.                            260
    Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
    And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:[71]
    Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose.
    Subjected tribute to commanding love,
    Against whose fury and unmatched force                              265
    The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
    Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.[72]
    He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
    May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,[73]
    With all my heart I thank thee for my father!                       270
    Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
    When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
    Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;[74]
    And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
    If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:                        275
    Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.                [_Exeunt._

ACT II.


SCENE I. _France. Before Angiers._

    _Enter_ AUSTRIA _and forces, drums, etc. on one side: on the
        other_ KING PHILIP _of France and his Power_; LEWIS, ARTHUR,
        CONSTANCE _and attendants._[75]

    _Lew._ Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.[76]
    Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
    Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
    And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
    By this brave duke came early to his grave:                           5
    And for amends to his posterity,
    At our importance hither is he come,
    To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,
    And to rebuke the usurpation
    Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:                                10
    Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.

    _Arth._ God shall forgive you Cœur-de-lion's death
    The rather that you give his offspring life,
    Shadowing their right under your wings of war:[77]
    I give you welcome with a powerless hand,                            15
    But with a heart full of unstained love:[78]
    Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.

    _Lew._ A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?

    _Aust._ Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
    As seal to this indenture of my love,                                20
    That to my home I will no more return,
    Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
    Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,
    Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
    And coops from other lands her islanders,                            25
    Even till that England, hedged in with the main,
    That water-walled bulwark, still secure
    And confident from foreign purposes,
    Even till that utmost corner of the west[79]
    Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,                       30
    Will I not think of home, but follow arms.

    _Const._ O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
    Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
    To make a more requital to your love!

    _Aust._ The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords[80]     35
    In such a just and charitable war.

    _K. Phi._ Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent[81]
    Against the brows of this resisting town.
    Call for our chiefest men of discipline,
    To cull the plots of best advantages:                                40
    We'll lay before this town our royal bones,
    Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,
    But we will make it subject to this boy.

    _Const._ Stay for an answer to your embassy,
    Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:                     45
    My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
    That right in peace which here we urge in war,
    And then we shall repent each drop of blood
    That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.[82]

                           _Enter_ CHATILLON.

    _K. Phi._ A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,                         50
    Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!
    What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;
    We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.

    _Chat._ Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
    And stir them up against a mightier task.                            55
    England, impatient of your just demands,
    Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
    Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time
    To land his legions all as soon as I;
    His marches are expedient to this town,                              60
    His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
    With him along is come the mother-queen,
    An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;[83]
    With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;
    With them a bastard of the king's deceased;[84]                      65
    And all the unsettled humours of the land,
    Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
    With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,
    Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
    Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,[85]                70
    To make a hazard of new fortunes here:
    In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
    Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
    Did never float upon the swelling tide,
    To do offence and scath in Christendom.          [_Drum beats._[86]  75
    The interruption of their churlish drums
    Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,[87]
    To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.[87]

    _K. Phi._ How much unlook'd for is this expedition!

    _Aust._ By how much unexpected, by so much                           80
    We must awake endeavour for defence;
    For courage mounteth with occasion:
    Let them be welcome then; we are prepared.

     _Enter_ KING JOHN, ELINOR, BLANCH, _the_ Bastard, Lords, _and
                             Forces_.[88]

    _K. John._ Peace be to France, if France in peace permit[89]
    Our just and lineal entrance to our own;                             85
    If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
    Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct[90]
    Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.[91]

    _K. Phi._ Peace be to England, if that war return
    From France to England, there to live in peace.                      90
    England we love; and for that England's sake
    With burden of our armour here we sweat.
    This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
    But thou from loving England art so far,
    That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king,[92]                    95
    Cut off the sequence of posterity,
    Out-faced infant state and done a rape
    Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
    Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;
    These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:                   100
    This little abstract doth contain that large
    Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
    Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.[93]
    That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
    And this his son; England was Geffrey's right                       105
    And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God[94]
    How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
    When living blood doth in these temples beat,
    Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?

    _K. John._ From whom hast thou this great commission, France,       110
    To draw my answer from thy articles?[95]

    _K. Phi._ From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts
    In any breast of strong authority,[96]
    To look into the blots and stains of right:[97]
    That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:                       115
    Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
    And by whose help I mean to chastise it.

    _K. John._ Alack, thou dost usurp authority.[98]

    _K. Phi._ Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.[98][99]

    _Eli._ Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?[98][100]           120

    _Const._ Let me make answer; thy usurping son.[98]

    _Eli._ Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,[98]
    That thou mayst be a queen, and check the world![98]

    _Const._ My bed was ever to thy son as true[98]
    As thine was to thy husband; and this boy[98]                       125
    Liker in feature to his father Geffrey[98]
    Than thou and John in manners; being as like[98][101]
    As rain to water, or devil to his dam.[98]
    My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think[98]
    His father never was so true begot:[98]                             130
    It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.[98][102]

    _Eli._ There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.[98]

    _Const._ There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.[98][103]

    _Aust._ Peace![98]

    _Bast._         Hear the crier.[98]

    _Aust._                          What the devil art thou?[98]

    _Bast._ One that will play the devil, sir, with you,[98]            135
    An a' may catch your hide and you alone:[98][104]
    You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,[98]
    Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard:[98]
    I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;[98][105]
    Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.[98]                  140

    _Blanch._ O, well did he become that lion's robe[98]
    That did disrobe the lion of that robe![98]

    _Bast._ It lies as sightly on the back of him[98]
    As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:[98][106]
    But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,[98]                145
    Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.[98]

    _Aust._ What cracker is this same that deafs our ears[98]
    With this abundance of superfluous breath?[98]

    _K. Phi._ Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.[98][107]

    _Lew._ Women and fools, break off your conference.[98][108]         150
    King John, this is the very sum of all;
    England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,[109]
    In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:[110]
    Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?

    _K. John._ My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.                 155
    Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;[111]
    And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
    Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:
    Submit thee, boy.[112]

    _Eli._        Come to thy grandam, child.[112]

    _Const._ Do, child, go to it grandam, child;[112][113][114]         160
    Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will[112][114]
    Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:[112]
    There's a good grandam.[112]

    _Arth._             Good my mother, peace![112]
    I would that I were low laid in my grave:[112]
    I am not worth this coil that's made for me.[112]                   165

    _Eli._ His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.[112]

    _Const._ Now shame upon you, whether she does or no![112][115]
    His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,[112][116]
    Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,[112][117]
    Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;[112]                    170
    Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed[112][118]
    To do him justice and revenge on you.[112]

    _Eli._ Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth![112]

    _Const._ Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth![112]
    Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp[112][119]               175
    The dominations, royalties and rights[112][120]
    Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,[112][121]
    Infortunate in nothing but in thee:[112]
    Thy sins are visited in this poor child;[112][122]
    The canon of the law is laid on him,[112]                           180
    Being but the second generation[112]
    Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.[112]

    _K. John._ Bedlam, have done.[112][123]

    _Const._                       I have but this to say,[112]
    That he is not only plagued for her sin,[112]
    But God hath made her sin and her the plague[112]                   185
    On this removed issue, plagued for her[112]
    And with her plague; her sin his injury,[112][124]
    Her injury the beadle to her sin,[112][125]
    All punish'd in the person of this child,[112]
    And all for her; a plague upon her![112][126]                       190

    _Eli._ Thou unadvised scold, I can produce[112]
    A will that bars the title of thy son.[112]

    _Const._ Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will;[112]
    A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will![112]

    _K. Phi._ Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate:[112]            195
    It ill beseems this presence to cry aim[112][127]
    To these ill-tuned repetitions.[112]
    Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
    These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak
    Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.                         200

    _Trumpet sounds. Enter certain_ Citizens _upon the walls_.[128]

    _First Cit._ Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?

    _K. Phi._ 'Tis France, for England.

    _K. John._                          England, for itself.
    You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects,--

    _K. Phi._ You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
    Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle,--                      205

    _K. John._ For our advantage; therefore hear us first.[129]
    These flags of France, that are advanced here
    Before the eye and prospect of your town,
    Have hither march'd to your endamagement:
    The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,                        210
    And ready mounted are they to spit forth
    Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
    All preparation for a bloody siege[130]
    And merciless proceeding by these French[131]
    Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;[132]                215
    And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
    That as a waist doth girdle you about,[133]
    By the compulsion of their ordinance[134]
    By this time from their fixed beds of lime
    Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made                            220
    For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
    But on the sight of us your lawful king,
    Who painfully with much expedient march
    Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
    To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,[135]             225
    Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;
    And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,[136]
    To make a shaking fever in your walls,
    They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
    To make a faithless error in your ears:                             230
    Which trust accordingly kind citizens,
    And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,[137]
    Forwearied in this action of swift speed,[138]
    Crave harbourage within your city walls.[139]

    _K. Phi._ When I have said, make answer to us both.                 235
    Lo, in this right hand, whose protection
    Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
    Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
    Son to the elder brother of this man,
    And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:                           240
    For this down-trodden equity, we tread
    In warlike march these greens before your town,
    Being no further enemy to you
    Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
    In the relief of this oppressed child                               245
    Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
    To pay that duty which you truly owe
    To him that owes it, namely this young prince:[140]
    And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
    Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;[141]                    250
    Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
    Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;[142]
    And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
    With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised.
    We will bear home that lusty blood again                            255
    Which here we came to spout against your town,
    And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
    But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,[143]
    'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls[144]
    Can hide you from our messengers of war,                            260
    Though all these English and their discipline
    Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.[145]
    Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
    In that behalf which we have challenged it?[146]
    Or shall we give the signal to our rage                             265
    And stalk in blood to our possession?

    _First Cit._ In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:
    For him, and in his right, we hold this town.[147]

    _K. John._ Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.

    _First Cit._ That can we not; but he that proves the king,          270
    To him will we prove loyal: till that time
    Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.

    _K. John._ Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
    And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
    Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--                 275

    _Bast._ Bastards, and else.[148]

    _K. John._ To verify our title with their lives.

    _K. Phi._ As many and as well-born bloods as those,--

    _Bast._ Some bastards too.[148]

    _K. Phi._ Stand in his face to contradict his claim.                280

    _First Cit._ Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
    We for the worthiest hold the right from both.

    _K. John._ Then God forgive the sin of all those souls[149]
    That to their everlasting residence,
    Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,                        285
    In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!

    _K. Phi._ Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!

    _Bast._ Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since[150]
    Sits on his horse back at mine hostess' door,[150][151]
    Teach us some fence! [_To Aust._] Sirrah, were I at home,[152]      290
    At your den, sirrah, with your lioness,
    I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,[153]
    And make a monster of you.

    _Aust._                    Peace! no more.

    _Bast._ O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar.

    _K. John._ Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth            295
    In best appointment all our regiments.

    _Bast._ Speed then, to take advantage of the field.[154]

    _K. Phi._ It shall be so; and at the other hill[155]
    Command the rest to stand. God and our right!             [_Exeunt._

 _Here after excursions, enter the_ Herald of France, _with trumpets,
                          to the gates_.[156]

    _F. Her._ You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,[157]            300
    And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,[158]
    Who by the hand of France this day hath made
    Much work for tears in many an English mother,
    Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground:[159]
    Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,[160]                        305
    Coldly embracing the discoloured earth;[161]
    And victory, with little loss, doth play[162]
    Upon the dancing banners of the French,
    Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,[163]
    To enter conquerors and to proclaim                                 310
    Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.[158]

              _Enter_ English Herald, _with trumpet_.[164]

    _E. Her._ Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells;
    King John, your king and England's, doth approach,
    Commander of this hot malicious day:
    Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,                 315
    Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;[165]
    There stuck no plume in any English crest
    That is removed by a staff of France;[166]
    Our colours do return in those same hands
    That did display them when we first march'd forth;                  320
    And, like a jolly troop of huntsmen, come
    Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
    Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:[167]
    Open your gates and give the victors way.

    _First Cit._ Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,[168]     325
    From first to last, the onset and retire
    Of both your armies; whose equality
    By our best eyes cannot be censured:
    Blood hath bought blood and blows have answer'd blows;
    Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:         330
    Both are alike; and both alike we like.
    One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,
    We hold our town for neither, yet for both.

     _Re-enter the two_ KINGS, _with their powers, severally_.[169]

    _K. John._ France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?[170]
    Say, shall the current of our right run on?[171]                    335
    Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
    Shall leave his native channel, and o'erswell
    With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
    Unless thou let his silver water keep[172]
    A peaceful progress to the ocean.                                   340

    _K. Phi._ England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
    In this hot trial, more than we of France;
    Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
    That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
    Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,[173]                   345
    We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
    Or add a royal number to the dead,
    Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
    With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.

    _Bast._ Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,                     350
    When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
    O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
    The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
    And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,[174]
    In undetermined differences of kings.                               355
    Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
    Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
    You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits![175]
    Then let confusion of one part confirm
    The other's peace; till then, blows, blood, and death!              360

    _K. John._ Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?

    _K. Phi._ Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?[176]

    _First Cit._ The king of England, when we know the king.

    _K. Phi._ Know him in us, that here hold up his right.

    _K. John._ In us, that are our own great deputy,                    365
    And bear possession of our person here,[177]
    Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.[178]

    _First Cit._ A greater power than we denies all this;[179]
    And till it be undoubted, we do lock
    Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;                      370
    King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,[180][181]
    Be by some certain king purged and deposed.[181]

    _Bast._ By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,[182]
    And stand securely on their battlements,
    As in a theatre, whence they gape and point                         375
    At your industrious scenes and acts of death.[183]
    Your royal presences be ruled by me:[184]
    Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,[185]
    Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend[186]
    Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:                         380
    By east and west let France and England mount
    Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
    Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
    The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
    I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,                             385
    Even till unfenced desolation
    Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
    That done, dissever your united strengths,
    And part your mingled colours once again;
    Turn face to face and bloody point to point;                        390
    Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
    Out of one side her happy minion,
    To whom in favour she shall give the day,
    And kiss him with a glorious victory.
    How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?                      395
    Smacks it not something of the policy?[187]

    _K. John._ Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
    I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers
    And lay this Angiers even with the ground;
    Then after fight who shall be king of it?                           400

    _Bast._ An if them hast the mettle of a king,[188]
    Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town,
    Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
    As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
    And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,                    405
    Why then defy each other, and pell-mell
    Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.

    _K. Phi._ Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?

    _K. John._ We from the west will send destruction
    Into this city's bosom.                                             410

    _Aust._ I from the north.

    _K. Phi._                  Our thunder from the south[189]
    Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.

    _Bast._ O prudent discipline! From north to south:[190]
    Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:[190]
    I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away![190]                        415

    _First Cit._ Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
    And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;
    Win you this city without stroke or wound;
    Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
    That here come sacrifices for the field:                            420
    Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.

    _K. John._ Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.[191]

    _First Cit._ That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
    Is niece to England: look upon the years[192]
    Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:[193]                     425
    If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
    Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
    If zealous love should go in search of virtue,[194]
    Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
    If love ambitious sought a match of birth,                          430
    Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
    Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
    Is the young Dauphin every way complete:[193]
    If not complete of, say he is not she;[195]
    And she again wants nothing, to name want,                          435
    If want it be not that she is not he:[196]
    He is the half part of a blessed man,
    Left to be finished by such as she;[197]
    And she a fair divided excellence,[198]
    Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.                            440
    O, two such silver currents, when they join,
    Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
    And two such shores to two such streams made one,
    Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
    To these two princes, if you marry them.                            445
    This union shall do more than battery can
    To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
    With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,[199]
    The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope.
    And give you entrance: but without this match,                      450
    The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
    Lions more confident, mountains and rocks[200]
    More free from motion, no, not Death himself[200]
    In mortal fury half so peremptory,
    As we to keep this city.

    _Bast._                    Here's a stay[201]                       455
    That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
    Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
    That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
    Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
    As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!                              460
    What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?[202]
    He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;[203]
    He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
    Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
    But buffets better than a fist of France:                           465
    Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
    Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.[204]

    _Eli._ Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;[205][206]
    Give with our niece a dowry large enough:[206]
    For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie[206]                      470
    Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,[206][207]
    That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe[206]
    The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.[206]
    I see a yielding in the looks of France;[206]
    Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls[206]            475
    Are capable of this ambition,[206]
    Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath[206][208]
    Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,[206]
    Cool and congeal again to what it was.[206]

    _First Cit._ Why answer not the double majesties                    480
    This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?

    _K. Phi._ Speak England first, that hath been forward first[209]
    To speak unto this city: what say you?

    _K. John._ If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,[193]
    Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'                           485
    Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:[210]
    For Anjou, and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,[211]
    And all that we upon this side the sea,
    Except this city now by us besieged,
    Find liable to our crown and dignity,                               490
    Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
    In titles, honours and promotions,
    As she in beauty, education, blood,[212]
    Holds hand with any princess of the world.[213]

    _K. Phi._ What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.           495

    _Lew._ I do, my lord; and in her eye I find[214]
    A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
    The shadow of myself form'd in her eye;[215]
    Which, being but the shadow of your son,[215]
    Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:[215][216]                500
    I do protest I never loved myself
    Till now infixed I beheld myself[217]
    Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.[218]

                                                [_Whispers with Blanch._

    _Bast._ Drawn in the flattering table of her eye![219]
      Hang'd in the frowning-wrinkle of her brow!                       505
    And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
      Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
    That, hang'd and drawn and quarter'd, there should be
    In such a love so vile a lout as he.

    _Blanch._ My uncle's will in this respect is mine:[220]             510
    If he see aught in you that makes him like,
    That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,
    I can with ease translate it to my will;[221]
    Or if you will, to speak more properly,
    I will enforce it easily to my love.[222]                           515
    Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
    That all I see in you is worthy love,
    Than this; that nothing do I see in you,
    Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
    That I can find should merit any hate.                              520

    _K. John._ What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?

    _Blanch._ That she is bound in honour still to do
    What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.[223]

    _K. John._ Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?

    _Lew._ Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;                      525
    For I do love her most unfeignedly.

    _K. John._ Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
    Poictiers, and Anjou, these five provinces,[224]
    With her to thee; and this addition more,
    Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.                         530
    Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
    Command thy son and daughter to join hands.

    _K. Phi._ It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.[225]

    _Aust._ And your lips too; for I am well assured[226]
    That I did so when I was first assured.[226]                        535

    _K. Phi._ Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,[227]
    Let in that amity which you have made;
    For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
    The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
    Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?                            540
    I know she is not, for this match made up[228]
    Her presence would have interrupted much:
    Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.[229]

    _Lew._ She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.[230]

    _K. Phil._ And, by my faith, this league that we have made          545
    Will give her sadness very little cure.
    Brother of England, how may we content
    This widow lady? In her right we came;[231]
    Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,
    To our own vantage.

    _K. John._            We will heal up all;                          550
    For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne[232]
    And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
    We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;[233]
    Some speedy messenger bid her repair
    To our solemnity: I trust we shall,                                 555
    If not fill up the measure of her will,
    Yet in some measure satisfy her so
    That we shall stop her exclamation.
    Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
    To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.                              560

                                     [_Exeunt all but the Bastard._[234]

    _Bast._ Mad world! mad kings! mad composition![235]
    John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
    Hath willingly departed with a part,
    And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
    Whom zeal and charity brought to the field                          565
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
    That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
    Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,                    570
    Who, having no external thing to lose[236]
    But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,[237]
    That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
    Commodity, the bias of the world,
    The world, who of itself is peised well,[238]                       575
    Made to run even upon even ground,
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,[239]
    This sway of motion, this Commodity,
    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent:                        580
    And this same bias, this Commodity,
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,[240]
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
    Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,[241]
    From a resolved and honourable war,                                 585
    To a most base and vile-concluded peace.[242]
    And why rail I on this Commodity?[243]
    But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,[244]
    When his fair angels would salute my palm;                          590
    But for my hand, as unattempted yet,[245]
    Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail[246]
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be                             595
    To say there is no vice but beggary.
    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.[247]      [_Exit._

SCENE I. _The French_ KING'S _Pavilion_.[248]

              _Enter_ CONSTANCE, ARTHUR, _and_ SALISBURY.

    _Const._ Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
    False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
    Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
    It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard;
    Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:                            5
    It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:
    I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word[249]
    Is but the vain breath of a common man:
    Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;[250]
    I have a king's oath to the contrary.                                10
    Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
    For I am sick and capable of fears,
    Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears.
    A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
    A woman, naturally born to fears;                                    15
    And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,[251]
    With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,[251][252]
    But they will quake and tremble all this day.
    What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
    Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?                               20
    What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
    Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
    Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
    Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?[253]
    Then speak again; not all thy former tale,                           25
    But this one word, whether thy tale be true.

    _Sal._ As true as I believe you think them false[254]
    That give you cause to prove my saying true.

    _Const._ O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
    Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,                           30
    And let belief and life encounter so
    As doth the fury of two desperate men
    Which in the very meeting fall and die.
    Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?[255]
    France friend with England, what becomes of me?[256]                 35
    Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:
    This news hath made thee a most ugly man.[257]

    _Sal._ What other harm have I, good lady, done,[257]
    But spoke the harm that is by others done?[257]

    _Const._ Which harm within itself so heinous is[257]                 40
    As it makes harmful all that speak of it.[257]

    _Arth._ I do beseech you, madam, be content.[258]

    _Const._ If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
    Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,
    Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,[259]                  45
    Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
    Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
    I would not care, I then would be content,
    For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
    Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.                          50
    But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
    Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
    Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
    And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
    She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;                         55
    She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,[260]
    And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
    To tread down fair respect of sovereignty.
    And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
    France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,[261]                      60
    That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
    Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
    Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
    And leave those woes alone which I alone[262]
    Am bound to under-bear.

    _Sal._                    Pardon me, madam,                          65
    I may not go without you to the kings.

    _Const._ Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:
    I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;[263]
    For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.[264]
    To me and to the state of my great grief                             70
    Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
    That no supporter but the huge firm earth[265]
    Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;[266]
    Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.

                                    [_Seats herself on the ground._[267]

      _Enter_ KING JOHN, KING PHILIP, LEWIS, BLANCH, ELINOR, _the_
                  BASTARD, AUSTRIA, _and_ Attendants.

    _K. Phi._ 'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day
    Ever in France shall be kept festival:[268]                          75
    To solemnize this day the glorious sun
    Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
    Turning with splendour of his precious eye
    The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:                          80
    The yearly course that brings this day about
    Shall never see it but a holiday.[269]

    _Const._ A wicked day, and not a holy day!           [_Rising._[270]
    What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,
    That it in golden letters should be set                              85
    Among the high tides in the calendar?
    Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
    This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
    Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
    Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,                      90
    Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:
    But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;[271]
    No bargains break that are not this day made:
    This day, all things begun come to ill end,
    Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change![272]                   95

    _K. Phi._ By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
    To curse the fair proceedings of this day:
    Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?

    _Const._ You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
    Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,[273]            100
    Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
    You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,[274]
    But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
    The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
    Is cold in amity and painted peace,[275]                            105
    And our oppression hath made up this league.[276]
    Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings![277]
    A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens![278]
    Let not the hours of this ungodly day
    Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,[279]                    110
    Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!
    Hear me, O, hear me!

    _Aust._              Lady Constance, peace!

    _Const._ War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war.
    O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
    That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!            115
    Thou little valiant, great in villany!
    Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
    Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
    But when her humorous ladyship is by
    To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,                        120
    And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou.
    A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear[280]
    Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
    Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
    Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend                            125
    Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
    And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
    Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,
    And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.[281]

    _Aust._ O, that a man should speak those words to me![282]          130

    _Bast._ And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.[283]

    _Aust._ Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.

    _Bast._ And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.[283][284]

    _K. John._ We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.

                         _Enter_ PANDULPH.[285]

    _K. Phi._ Here comes the holy legate of the pope.                   135

    _Pand._ Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
    To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
    I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
    And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
    Do in his name religiously demand                                   140
    Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
    So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
    Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop[286]
    Of Canterbury, from that holy see?[287]
    This, in our foresaid holy father's name,                           145
    Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.

    _K. John._ What earthy name to interrogatories[288]
    Can task the free breath of a sacred king?[289]
    Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
    So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,                                 150
    To charge me to an answer, as the pope.[290]
    Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
    Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
    Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
    But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,[291]                     155
    So under Him that great supremacy,[292]
    Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
    Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
    So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
    To him and his usurp'd authority.                                   160

    _K. Phi._ Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.

    _K. John._ Though you and all the kings of Christendom
    Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
    Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
    And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,                         165
    Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
    Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
    Though you and all the rest so grossly led
    This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
    Yet I alone, alone do me oppose                                     170
    Against the pope and count his friends my foes.

    _Pand._ Then, by the lawful power that I have,
    Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate:
    And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
    From his allegiance to an heretic;                                  175
    And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
    Canonized and worshipp'd as a saint,[293]
    That takes away by any secret course
    Thy hateful life.

    _Const._            O, lawful let it be
    That I have room with Rome to curse awhile![294]                    180
    Good father cardinal, cry thou amen
    To my keen curses; for without my wrong
    There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.

    _Pand._ There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.

    _Const._ And for mine too: when law can do no right,[295]           185
    Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:
    Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
    For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
    Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
    How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?                          190

    _Pand._ Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
    Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;
    And raise the power of France upon his head,
    Unless he do submit himself to Rome.

    _Eli._ Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.           195

    _Const._ Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,[296]
    And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.

    _Aust._ King Philip, listen to the cardinal.

    _Bast._ And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.[297]

    _Aust._ Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,               200
    Because--

    _Bast._    Your breeches best may carry them.

    _K. John._ Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?

    _Const._ What should he say, but as the cardinal?

    _Lew._ Bethink you, father; for the difference
    Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,                             205
    Or the light loss of England for a friend:
    Forego the easier.

    _Blanch._            That's the curse of Rome.[298]

    _Const._ O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here[299]
    In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.[300]

    _Blanch._ The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,[301]        210
    But from her need.[301]

    _Const._             O, if thou grant my need,[301]
    Which only lives but by the death of faith,[301]
    That need must needs infer this principle,[301]
    That faith would live again by death of need.[301]
    O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;[301]               215
    Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down![301]

    _K. John._ The king is moved, and answers not to this.[301][302]

    _Const._ O, be removed from him, and answer well![301]

    _Aust._ Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.[301]

    _Bast._ Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.[301]       220

    _K. Phi._ I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.

    _Pand._ What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
    If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?

    _K. Phi._ Good reverend father, make my person yours,
    And tell me how you would bestow yourself.                          225
    This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
    And the conjunction of our inward souls
    Married in league, coupled and link'd together
    With all religious strength of sacred vows;
    The latest breath that save the sound of words                      230
    Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
    Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
    And even before this truce, but new before,[303]
    No longer than we well could wash our hands
    To clap this royal bargain up of peace,                             235
    Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and overstain'd
    With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
    The fearful difference of incensed kings:
    And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
    So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,                         240
    Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
    Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
    Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
    As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
    Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed                        245
    Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
    And make a riot on the gentle brow
    Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
    My reverend father, let it not be so!
    Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose                           250
    Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest[304]
    To do your pleasure and continue friends.

    _Pand._ All form is formless, order orderless.
    Save what is opposite to England's love.
    Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,                       255
    Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
    A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
    France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
    A chafed lion by the mortal paw,[305]
    A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,                                 260
    Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.

    _K. Phi._ I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.

    _Pand._ So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
    And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,
    Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow                       265
    First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
    That is, to be the champion of our church.
    What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
    And may not be performed by thyself,
    For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss                          270
    Is not amiss when it is truly done,[306]
    And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
    The truth is then most done not doing it:
    The better act of purposes mistook
    Is to mistake again; though indirect,[307]                          275
    Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
    And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
    Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
    It is religion that doth make vows kept;
    But thou hast sworn against religion,                               280
    By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,[308]
    And makest an oath the surety for thy truth[309]
    Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure[309][310][311]
    To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;[311][312]
    Else what a mockery should it be to swear!                          285
    But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
    And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
    Therefore thy later vows against thy first[313]
    Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
    And better conquest never canst thou make                           290
    Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
    Against these giddy loose suggestions:[314]
    Upon which better part our prayers come in,
    If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
    The peril of our curses light on thee[315]                          295
    So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
    But in despair die under their black weight.

    _Aust._ Rebellion, flat rebellion!

    _Bast._                            Will't not be?
    Will not a calf's-skin stop that mouth of thine?

    _Lew._ Father, to arms![316]

    _Blanch._                Upon thy wedding-day?                      300
    Against the blood that thou hast married?
    What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?[317]
    Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
    Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?
    O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new[318]                         305
    Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,
    Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
    Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
    Against mine uncle.

    _Const._              O, upon my knee,[319]
    Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,[319]                    310
    Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom[319]
    Forethought by heaven![319]

    _Blanch._ Now shall I see thy love: what motive may
    Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?

    _Const._ That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,                315
    His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!

    _Lew._ I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,
    When such profound respects do pull you on.

    _Pand._ I will denounce a curse upon his head.

    _K. Phi._ Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from
        thee.[320]                                                      320

    _Const._ O fair return of banish'd majesty!

    _Eli._ O foul revolt of French inconstancy!

    _K. John._ France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.

    _Bast._ Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
    Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue.                      325

    _Blanch._ The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!
    Which is the side that I must go withal?
    I am with both: each army hath a hand;
    And in their rage, I having hold of both,
    They whirl asunder and dismember me.                                330
    Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
    Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
    Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
    Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive:
    Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose;                            335
    Assured loss before the match be play'd.

    _Lew._ Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.[321]

    _Blanch._ There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.

    _K. John._ Cousin, go draw our puissance together.

                                                   [_Exit Bastard._[322]

    France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;                        340
    A rage whose heat hath this condition,
    That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,[323]
    The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.[324]

    _K. Phi._ Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
    To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:                     345
    Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.

    _K. John._ No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie! [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _The same. Plains near Angiers._[325]

   _Alarums, excursions. Enter the_ BASTARD, _with_ AUSTRIA'S _head_.

    _Bast._ Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
    Some airy devil hovers in the sky,[326]
    And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,
    While Philip breathes.

             _Enter_ KING JOHN, ARTHUR, _and_ HUBERT.[327]

    _K. John._ Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:[328]               5
    My mother is assailed in our tent,
    And ta'en, I fear.

    _Bast._            My lord, I rescued her;
    Her highness is in safety, fear you not:
    But on, my liege; for very little pains
    Will bring this labour to an happy end.             [_Exeunt._[329]  10


SCENE III. _The same._[330]

    _Alarums, excursions, retreat. Enter_ KING JOHN, ELINOR, ARTHUR,
                  _the_ BASTARD, HUBERT, _and_ Lords.

    _K. John._ [_To Elinor_] So shall it be; your grace shall stay
        behind[331]
    So strongly guarded. [_To Arthur_] Cousin, look not sad:[332]
    Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will
    As dear be to thee as thy father was.

    _Arth._ O, this will make my mother die with grief!                   5

    _K. John._ [_To the Bastard_] Cousin, away for England! haste
        before:[333]
    And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
    Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels[334]
    Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace[334][335]
    Must by the hungry now be fed upon:[336]                             10
    Use our commission in his utmost force.[337]

    _Bast._ Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,
    When gold and silver becks me to come on.[338]
    I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,
    If ever I remember to be holy,                                       15
    For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.

    _Eli._ Farewell, gentle cousin.

    _K. John._                     Coz, farewell.  [_Exit Bastard._[339]

    _Eli._ Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.[340]

    _K. John._ Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,[341]
    We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh                          20
    There is a soul counts thee her creditor,
    And with advantage means to pay thy love:
    And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
    Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
    Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,                              25
    But I will fit it with some better time.[342]
    By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed[343]
    To say what good respect I have of thee.

    _Hub._ I am much bounden to your majesty.

    _K. John._ Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,[344]       30
    But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
    Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
    I had a thing to say, but let it go:
    The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
    Attended with the pleasures of the world,                            35
    Is all too wanton and too full of gawds[345]
    To give me audience: if the midnight bell
    Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,[346]
    Sound on into the drowsy race of night;[346][347]
    If this same were a churchyard where we stand,                       40
    And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
    Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
    Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,[348]
    Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,[349]
    Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes[350]                    45
    And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
    A passion hateful to my purposes,
    Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
    Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
    Without a tongue, using conceit alone,                               50
    Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
    Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,[351]
    I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
    But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;
    And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.                       55

    _Hub._ So well, that what you bid me undertake,
    Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
    By heaven, I would do it.[352]

    _K. John._                  Do not I know thou wouldst?
    Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
    On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,                    60
    He is a very serpent in my way;
    And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
    He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
    Thou art his keeper.

    _Hub._                 And I'll keep him so,
    That he shall not offend your majesty.[353]

    _K. John._                               Death.[65]                  65

    _Hub._ My lord?[354]

    _K. John._      A grave.

    _Hub._                   He shall not live.

    _K. John._                                  Enough.
    I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;
    Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:
    Remember. Madam, fare you well:[355]
    I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.                         70

    _Eli._ My blessing go with thee!

    _K. John._                       For England, cousin, go:[356]
    Hubert shall be your man, attend on you[357]
    With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!                 [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _The same. The_ FRENCH KING'S _tent_.

      _Enter_ KING PHILIP, LEWIS, PANDULPH, _and_ Attendants.[358]

    _K. Phi._ So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
    A whole armado of convicted sail[359]
    Is scattered and disjoin'd from fellowship.[360]

    _Pand._ Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.

    _K. Phi._ What can go well, when we have run so ill?                  5
    Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
    Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?
    And bloody England into England gone,
    O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?

    _Lew._ What he hath won, that hath he fortified:                     10
    So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
    Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,[361]
    Doth want example: who hath read or heard
    Of any kindred action like to this?

    _K. Phi._ Well could I bear that England had this praise,            15
    So we could find some pattern of our shame.

                           _Enter_ CONSTANCE.

    Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;[362]
    Holding the eternal spirit, against her will,[363]
    In the vile prison of afflicted breath.[364]
    I prithee, lady, go away with me.                                    20

    _Const._ Lo, now! now see the issue of your peace.

    _K. Phi._ Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!

    _Const._ No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
    But that which ends all counsel, true redress,[365]
    Death, death; O amiable lovely death![365]                           25
    Thou odoriferous stench! sound rottenness![366]
    Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,[367]
    Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
    And I will kiss thy detestable bones[368]
    And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows                              30
    And ring these fingers with thy household worms
    And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
    And be a carrion monster like thyself:
    Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest,
    And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,[369]                       35
    O, come to me!

    _K. Phil._     O fair affliction, peace!

    _Const._ No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
    O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
    Then with a passion would I shake the world;[370]
    And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy                               40
    Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,[371]
    Which scorns a modern invocation.[371][372]

    _Pand._ Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.

    _Const._ Thou art not holy to belie me so;[373]
    I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;                              45
    My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
    Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
    I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
    For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:
    O, if I could, what grief should I forget!                           50
    Preach some philosophy to make me mad,[374]
    And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;[374][375]
    For being not mad but sensible of grief,[374]
    My reasonable part produces reason[374]
    How I may be deliver'd of these woes,[374]                           55
    And teaches me to kill or hang myself:[374]
    If I were mad, I should forget my son,[374]
    Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:[374]
    I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
    The different plague of each calamity.                               60

    _K. Phi._ Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note[376]
    In the fair multitude of those her hairs![376]
    Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,[376]
    Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends[376][377]
    Do glue themselves in sociable grief,[376]                           65
    Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,[376][378]
    Sticking together in calamity.[376]

    _Const._ To England, if you will.[376]

    _K. Phi._                         Bind up your hairs.[376]

    _Const._ Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?[376]
    I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud[376]                    70
    'O that these hands could so redeem my son,[376]
    As they have given these hairs their liberty!'[376]
    But now I envy at their liberty,[376]
    And will again commit them to their bonds,[376]
    Because my poor child is a prisoner.[376]                            75
    And, father cardinal, I have heard you say[379]
    That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
    If that be true, I shall see my boy again;[380]
    For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
    To him that did but yesterday suspire,                               80
    There was not such a gracious creature born.
    But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
    And chase the native beauty from his cheek
    And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
    As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,                                  85
    And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
    When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
    I shall not know him: therefore never, never
    Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

    _Pand._ You hold too heinous a respect of grief.                     90

    _Const._ He talks to me that never had a son.

    _K. Phi._ You are as fond of grief as of your child.

    _Const._ Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
    Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
    Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,                         95
    Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
    Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
    Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?[381]
    Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,[382]
    I could give better comfort than you do.                            100
    I will not keep this form upon my head,[383]
    When there is such disorder in my wit.
    O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
    My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!
    My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!              [_Exit._[384]  105

    _K. Phi._ I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.         [_Exit._

    _Lew._ There's nothing in this world can make me joy:[385]
    Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
    Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
    And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste.[386]         110
    That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.[387]

    _Pand._ Before the curing of a strong disease,
    Even in the instant of repair and health,
    The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,[388]
    On their departure most of all show evil:[388]                      115
    What have you lost by losing of this day?

    _Lew._ All days of glory, joy and happiness.

    _Pand._ If you had won it, certainly you had.
    No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
    She looks upon them with a threatening eye.                         120
    'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
    In this which he accounts so clearly won:
    Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?

    _Lew._ As heartily as he is glad he hath him.

    _Pand._ Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.                 125
    Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
    For even the breath of what I mean to speak
    Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
    Out of the path which shall directly lead
    Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.                   130
    John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
    That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,[389]
    The misplaced John should entertain an hour,[390]
    One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.[391]
    A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand                              135
    Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;
    And he that stands upon a slippery place
    Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
    That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;[392]
    So be it, for it cannot be but so.                                  140

    _Lew._ But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?

    _Pand._ You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
    May then make all the claim that Arthur did.

    _Lew._ And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.

    _Pand._ How green you are and fresh in this old world!              145
    John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;[393]
    For he that steeps his safety in true blood
    Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
    This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts[394]
    Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,                         150
    That none so small advantage shall step forth[395]
    To check his reign, but they will cherish it;[396]
    No natural exhalation in the sky,
    No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,[397]
    No common wind, no customed event,                                  155
    But they will pluck away his natural cause[398]
    And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
    Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,[399]
    Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.

    _Lew._ May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,                160
    But hold himself safe in his prisonment.

    _Pand._ O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
    If that young Arthur be not gone already,
    Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts[400]
    Of all his people shall revolt from him                             165
    And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
    And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
    Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
    Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
    And, O, what better matter breeds for you[401]                      170
    Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
    Is now in England, ransacking the church,
    Offending charity: if but a dozen French[402]
    Were there in arms, they would be as a call
    To train ten thousand English to their side,                        175
    Or as a little snow, tumbled about,[403]
    Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,[404]
    Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
    What may be wrought out of their discontent,[405]
    Now that their souls are topful of offence.[405]                    180
    For England go: I will whet on the king.

    _Lew._ Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:[406]
    If you say ay, the king will not say no.                  [_Exeunt._

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _A room in a castle._

                _Enter_ HUBERT _and_ Executioners.[407]

    _Hub._ Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand[408]
    Within the arras: when I strike my foot
    Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
    And bind the boy which you shall find with me
    Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.                      5

    _First Exec._ I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.[409]

    _Hub._ Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.[410]

                                                 [_Exeunt Executioners._

    Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.

                            _Enter_ ARTHUR.

    _Arth._ Good morrow, Hubert.

    _Hub._                       Good morrow, little prince.[411]

    _Arth._ As little prince, having so great a title                    10
    To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.

    _Hub._ Indeed, I have been merrier.

    _Arth._                             Mercy on me!
    Methinks no body should be sad but I:
    Yet, I remember, when I was in France,[412]
    Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,                            15
    Only for wantonness. By my Christendom.
    So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
    I should be as merry as the day is long;[413]
    And so I would be here, but that I doubt
    My uncle practises more harm to me:                                  20
    He is afraid of me and I of him:
    Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
    No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven[414]
    I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.

    _Hub._ [_Aside_] If I talk to him, with his innocent prate[415]      25
    He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
    Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.

    _Arth._ Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:
    In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
    That I might sit all night and watch with you:                       30
    I warrant I love you more than you do me.[416]

    _Hub._ [_Aside_] His words do take possession of my bosom.[417]
    Read here, young Arthur.                         [_Showing a paper._
                             [_Aside_] How now, foolish rheum![418][419]
    Turning dispiteous torture out of door![419][420]
    I must be brief, lest resolution drop                                35
    Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
    Can you not read it? is it not fair writ?[421]

    _Arth._ Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:[422]
    Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?[423]

    _Hub._ Young boy, I must.

    _Arth._                    And will you?

    _Hub._                                 And I will.                   40

    _Arth._ Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
    I knit my handkercher about your brows,[424]
    The best I had, a princess wrought it me,
    And I did never ask it you again;
    And with my hand at midnight held your head,                         45
    And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
    Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
    Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'
    Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
    Many a poor man's son would have lien still[425]                     50
    And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
    But you at your sick service had a prince.[426]
    Nay, you may think my love was crafty love
    And call it cunning: do, an if you will:[427]
    If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,                       55
    Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
    These eyes that never did nor never shall[428]
    So much as frown on you.[429]

    _Hub._ I have sworn to do it;
    And with hot irons must I burn them out.

    _Arth._ Ah, none but in this iron age would do it![430]              60
    The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,[430]
    Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears[430]
    And quench his fiery indignation[430][431]
    Even in the matter of mine innocence;[430][432]
    Nay, after that, consume away in rust,[430]                          65
    But for containing fire to harm mine eye.[430]
    Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?[430][433]
    An if an angel should have come to me[434]
    And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
    I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.[435]         70

    _Hub._ Come forth.                                        [_Stamps._

        _Re-enter_ Executioners, _with a cord, irons, &c._[436]

    Do as I bid you do.

    _Arth._ O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out
    Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.

    _Hub._ Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.[437]              75

    _Arth._ Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?[438]
    I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.[439]
    For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound![440]
    Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
    And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;                                   80
    I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,[441]
    Nor look upon the iron angerly:[442]
    Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,
    Whatever torment you do put me to.

    _Hub._ Go, stand within; let me alone with him.                      85

    _First Exec._ I am best pleased to be from such a deed.[409]

                                            [_Exeunt Executioners._[443]

    _Arth._ Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
    He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:
    Let him come back, that his compassion may
    Give life to yours.

    _Hub._         Come, boy, prepare yourself.                          90

    _Arth._ Is there no remedy?

    _Hub._                 None, but to lose your eyes.

    _Arth._ O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,[444]
    A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
    Any annoyance in that precious sense!
    Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,                 95
    Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.

    _Hub._ Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.

    _Arth._ Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues[445]
    Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:[445]
    Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;                      100
    Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
    So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes,
    Though to no use but still to look on you!
    Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold
    And would not harm me.

    _Hub._             I can heat it, boy.                              105

    _Arth._ No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
    Being create for comfort, to be used
    In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;
    There is no malice in this burning coal;[446]
    The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out[447]                 110
    And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.[447]

    _Hub._ But with my breath I can revive it, boy.

    _Arth._ An if you do, you will but make it blush[448][449]
    And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:[448]
    Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;[448]                   115
    And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,[448]
    Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.[448][450]
    All things that you should use to do me wrong
    Deny their office: only you do lack
    That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,[451]                 120
    Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.[452]

    _Hub._ Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye[453]
    For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:[454]
    Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
    With this same very iron to burn them out.                          125

    _Arth._ O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
    You were disguised.[455]

    _Hub._         Peace; no more. Adieu.
    Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
    I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
    And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,                      130
    That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
    Will not offend thee.

    _Arth._ O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.

    _Hub._ Silence; no more: go closely in with me:
    Much danger do I undergo for thee.                        [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. KING JOHN'S _palace_.

    _Enter_ KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, _and other_ Lords.[456]

    _K. John._ Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,[457]
    And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.

    _Pem._ This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,
    Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
    And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,                          5
    The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
    Fresh expectation troubled not the land
    With any long'd-for change or better state.

    _Sal._ Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
    To guard a title that was rich before,                               10
    To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
    To throw a perfume on the violet,
    To smooth the ice, or add another hue
    Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
    To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,                      15
    Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.

    _Pem._ But that your royal pleasure must be done,
    This act is as an ancient tale new told,
    And in the last repeating troublesome,
    Being urged at a time unseasonable.                                  20

    _Sal._ In this the antique and well noted face
    Of plain old form is much disfigured;
    And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,
    It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
    Startles and frights consideration,                                  25
    Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,[458]
    For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.

    _Pem._ When workmen strive to do better than well,[459]
    They do confound their skill in covetousness;[460]
    And oftentimes excusing of a fault                                   30
    Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
    As patches set upon a little breach
    Discredit more in hiding of the fault[461]
    Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.[461]

    _Sal._ To this effect, before you were new crown'd,                  35
    We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness
    To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,[462]
    Since all and every part of what we would
    Doth make a stand at what your highness will.[463]

    _K. John._ Some reasons of this double coronation                    40
    I have possess'd you with and think them strong;
    And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,[464]
    I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
    What you would have reform'd that is not well,
    And well shall you perceive how willingly                            45
    I will both hear and grant you your requests.

    _Pem._ Then I, as one that am the tongue of these
    To sound the purposes of all their hearts,
    Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,
    Your safety, for the which myself and them[465]                      50
    Bend their best studies, heartily request
    The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
    Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
    To break into this dangerous argument,--[466]
    If what in rest you have in right you hold,[467]                     55
    Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend[468]
    The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up[468]
    Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
    With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
    The rich advantage of good exercise?                                 60
    That the time's enemies may not have this
    To grace occasions, let it be our suit
    That you have bid us ask his liberty;[469]
    Which for our goods we do no further ask[470]
    Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,[471]                      65
    Counts it your weal he have his liberty.[472]

                            _Enter_ HUBERT.

    _K. John._ Let it be so: I do commit his youth
    To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?

                                               [_Taking him apart._[473]

    _Pem._ This is the man should do the bloody deed;
    He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:                           70
    The image of a wicked heinous fault
    Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
    Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;[474]
    And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
    What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.                             75

    _Sal._ The colour of the king doth come and go
    Between his purpose and his conscience,
    Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:[475]
    His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.

    _Pem._ And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence                  80
    The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.

    _K. John._ We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:[476]
    Good lords, although my will to give is living,
    The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
    He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.                             85

    _Sal._ Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.

    _Pem._ Indeed we heard how near his death he was
    Before the child himself felt he was sick:
    This must be answer'd either here or hence.

    _K. John._ Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?                  90
    Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
    Have I commandment on the pulse of life?

    _Sal._ It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame[477]
    That greatness should so grossly offer it:
    So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.                         95

    _Pem._ Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
    And find the inheritance of this poor child,
    His little kingdom of a forced grave.
    That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,[478]
    Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!                    100
    This must not be thus borne: this will break out
    To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.      [_Exeunt Lords._[479]

    _K. John._ They burn in indignation. I repent:[480][481]
    There is no sure foundation set on blood,[481]
    No certain life achieved by others' death.[481]                     105

                       _Enter a_ Messenger.[482]

    A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
    That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
    So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
    Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?

    _Mess._ From France to England. Never such a power[483]             110
    For any foreign preparation
    Was levied in the body of a land.
    The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;
    For when you should be told they do prepare,
    The tidings comes that they are all arrived.[484]                   115

    _K. John._ O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
    Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,[485]
    That such an army could be drawn in France,
    And she not hear of it?

    _Mess._                   My liege, her ear
    Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died                       120
    Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,
    The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
    Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
    I idly heard; if true or false I know not.

    _K. John._ Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!                   125
    O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
    My discontented peers! What! mother dead![486]
    How wildly then walks my estate in France!
    Under whose conduct came those powers of France[487]
    That thou for truth givest out are landed here?                     130

    _Mess._ Under the Dauphin.[488]

    _K. John._                 Thou hast made me giddy
    With these ill tidings.

           _Enter the_ BASTARD _and_ PETER _of Pomfret_.[489]

                             Now, what says the world
    To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
    My head with more ill news, for it is full.

    _Bast._ But if you be afeard to hear the worst,[490]                135
    Then let the worst unheard fall on your head.

    _K. John._ Bear with me, cousin; for I was amazed
    Under the tide: but now I breathe again
    Aloft the flood, and can give audience
    To any tongue, speak it of what it will.                            140

    _Bast._ How I have sped among the clergy-men,[491]
    The sums I have collected shall express.
    But as I travell'd hither through the land,
    I find the people strangely fantasied;
    Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,                        145
    Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
    And here's a prophet, that I brought with me
    From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
    With many hundreds treading on his heels;
    To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,                     150
    That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
    Your highness should deliver up your crown.

    _K. John._ Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?

    _Peter._ Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.

    _K. John._ Hubert, away with him; imprison him;                     155
    And on that day at noon, whereon he says
    I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.
    Deliver him to safety; and return,
    For I must use thee.                 [_Exit Hubert with Peter._[492]

                         O my gentle cousin,
    Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?                      160

    _Bast._ The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
    Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
    With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
    And others more, going to seek the grave
    Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night[493][494]               165
    On your suggestion.[494]

    _K. John._            Gentle kinsman, go,
    And thrust thyself into their companies:[495]
    I have a way to win their loves again;
    Bring them before me.

    _Bast._                 I will seek them out.

    _K. John._ Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.             170
    O, let me have no subject enemies,[496]
    When adverse foreigners affright my towns
    With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
    Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
    And fly like thought from them to me again.                         175

    _Bast._ The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.        [_Exit._

    _K. John._ Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
    Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
    Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
    And be thou he.

    _Mess._           With all my heart, my liege.       [_Exit._[497]  180

    _K. John._ My mother dead!

                        _Re-enter_ HUBERT.[498]

    _Hub._ My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;[499]
    Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
    The other four in wondrous motion.

    _K. John._ Five moons!

    _Hub._            Old men and beldams in the streets                185
    Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
    Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
    And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
    And whisper one another in the ear;
    And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,                   190
    Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
    With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
    I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
    The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
    With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;                         195
    Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
    Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
    Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
    Told of a many thousand warlike French[500]
    That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:                           200
    Another lean unwash'd artificer
    Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.

    _K. John._ Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
    Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
    Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause[501]               205
    To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.

    _Hub._ No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?[502]

    _K. John._ It is the curse of kings to be attended
    By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
    To break within the bloody house of life,[503]                      210
    And on the winking of authority
    To understand a law, to know the meaning
    Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
    More upon humour than advised respect.

    _Hub._ Here is your hand and seal for what I did.                   215

    _K. John._ O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
    Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
    Witness against us to damnation!
    How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
    Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,[504]                   220
    A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
    Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
    This murder had not come into my mind:
    But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
    Finding thee fit for bloody villany,                                225
    Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
    I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
    And thou, to be endeared to a king,
    Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.[505]

    _Hub._ My lord,--                                                   230

    _K. John._ Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
    When I spake darkly what I purposed,
    Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
    As bid me tell my tale in express words,[506]
    Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,                   235
    And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
    But thou didst understand me by my signs
    And didst in signs again parley with sin;[507]
    Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
    And consequently thy rude hand to act                               240
    The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
    Out of my sight, and never see me more!
    My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
    Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
    Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,[508]                         245
    This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
    Hostility and civil tumult reigns[509]
    Between my conscience and my cousin's death.

    _Hub._ Arm you against your other enemies,
    I'll make a peace between your soul and you.                        250
    Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
    Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
    Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
    Within this bosom never enter'd yet
    The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;[510]                    255
    And you have slander'd nature in my form,
    Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
    Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
    Than to be butcher of an innocent child.[511]

    _K. John._ Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,            260
    Throw this report on their incensed rage,
    And make them tame to their obedience!
    Forgive the comment that my passion made
    Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
    And foul imaginary eyes of blood[512]                               265
    Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
    O, answer not, but to my closet bring
    The angry lords with all expedient haste.
    I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.                 [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _Before the castle._

                  _Enter_ ARTHUR, _on the walls_.[513]

    _Arth._ The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:
    Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
    There's few or none do know me: if they did,
    This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
    I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.                                 5
    If I get down, and do not break my limbs,
    I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:
    As good to die and go, as die and stay.          [_Leaps down._[514]
    O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:
    Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!            [_Dies._  10

               _Enter_ PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, _and_ BIGOT.

    _Sal._ Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:[515]
    It is our safety, and we must embrace
    This gentle offer of the perilous time.

    _Pem._ Who brought that letter from the cardinal?

    _Sal._ The Count Melun, a noble lord of France;[516]                 15
    Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love[517]
    Is much more general than these lines import.

    _Big._ To-morrow morning let us meet him then.

    _Sal._ Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
    Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.[518]                  20

                          _Enter the_ BASTARD.

    _Bast._ Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
    The king by me requests your presence straight.

    _Sal._ The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
    We will not line his thin bestained cloak[519]
    With our pure honours, nor attend the foot                           25
    That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
    Return and tell him so: we know the worst.

    _Bast._ Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.

    _Sal._ Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.

    _Bast._ But there is little reason in your grief;                    30
    Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.

    _Pem._ Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.[520]

    _Bast._ 'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.[520][521]

    _Sal._ This is the prison. What is he lies here?

                                                  [_Seeing Arthur._[522]

    _Pem._ O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!            35
    The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.

    _Sal._ Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
    Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.

    _Big._ Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,[523]
    Found it too precious-princely for a grave.[524]                     40

    _Sal._ Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,[525]
    Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
    Or do you almost think, although you see,
    That you do see? could thought, without this object,[526]
    Form such another? This is the very top,[527]                        45
    The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
    Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
    The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
    That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
    Presented to the tears of soft remorse.                              50

    _Pem._ All murders past do stand excused in this:
    And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
    Shall give a holiness, a purity,
    To the yet unbegotten sin of times;[528]
    And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,                             55
    Exampled by this heinous spectacle.

    _Bast._ It is a damned and a bloody work;
    The graceless action of a heavy hand,
    If that it be the work of any-hand.

    _Sal._ If that it be the work of any hand![529]                      60
    We had a kind of light what would ensue:
    It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
    The practice and the purpose of the king:
    From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
    Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,                             65
    And breathing to his breathless excellence[530]
    The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
    Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
    Never to be infected with delight,
    Nor conversant with ease and idleness,                               70
    Till I have set a glory to this hand,[531]
    By giving it the worship of revenge.

    _Pem._  }  Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
    _Big._  }

                            _Enter_ HUBERT.

    _Hub._ Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:[532]
    Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.                        75

    _Sal._ O, he is bold and blushes not at death.
    Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!

    _Hub._ I am no villain.

    _Sal._               Must I rob the law?  [_Drawing his sword._[533]

    _Bast._ Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.

    _Sal._ Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.                   80

    _Hub._ Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
    By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:
    I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
    Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
    Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget[534]                         85
    Your worth, your greatness and nobility.

    _Big._ Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?

    _Hub._ Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
    My innocent life against an emperor.

    _Sal._ Thou art a murderer.

    _Hub._                      Do not prove me so;[535]                 90
    Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
    Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.

    _Pem._ Cut him to pieces.

    _Bast._                   Keep the peace, I say.

    _Sal._ Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.

    _Bast._ Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:                  95
    If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
    Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
    I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;[536]
    Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
    That you shall think the devil is come from hell.                   100

    _Big._ What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?[537]
    Second a villain and a murderer?

    _Hub._ Lord Bigot, I am none.

    _Big._                        Who kill'd this prince?

    _Hub._ 'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
    I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep                          105
    My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.

    _Sal._ Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
    For villany is not without such rheum;[538]
    And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
    Like rivers of remorse and innocency.[539]                          110
    Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
    The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;[540]
    For I am stifled with this smell of sin.[541]

    _Big._ Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!

    _Pem._ There tell the king he may inquire us out.                   115

                                                        [_Exeunt Lords._

    _Bast._ Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?[542]
    Beyond the infinite and boundless reach[543]
    Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,[543]
    Art thou damn'd, Hubert.[543]

    _Hub._          Do but hear me, sir.

    _Bast._ Ha! I'll tell thee what;                                    120
    Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;[544]
    Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
    There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
    As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.

    _Hub._ Upon my soul--[545]

    _Bast._               If thou didst but consent                     125
    To this most cruel act, do but despair;
    And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
    That ever spider twisted from her womb
    Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be a beam[546]
    To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,[547]                130
    Put but a little water in a spoon,
    And it shall be as all the ocean,
    Enough to stifle such a villain up.
    I do suspect thee very grievously.

    _Hub._ If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,                     135
    Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
    Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
    Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
    I left him well.

    _Bast._          Go, bear him in thine arms.[548]
    I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way                              140
    Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
    How easy dost thou take all England up![549]
    From forth this morsel of dead royalty,[549]
    The life, the right and truth of all this realm
    Is fled to heaven; and England now is left                          145
    To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth[550]
    The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.[551]
    Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
    Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
    And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:                           150
    Now powers from home and discontents at home
    Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
    As doth a raven on a sick-fallen beast,[552]
    The imminent decay of wrested pomp.[553]
    Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can[554]                      155
    Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
    And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
    A thousand businesses are brief in hand,[555]
    And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.          [_Exeunt._[556]

SCENE I. KING JOHN'S _palace_.

          _Enter_ KING JOHN, PANDULPH, _and_ Attendants.[557]

    _K. John._ Thus have I yielded up into your hand
    The circle of my glory.                    [_Giving the crown._[558]

    _Pand._                 Take again
    From this my hand, as holding of the pope[559]
    Your sovereign greatness and authority.

    _K. John._ Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,               5
    And from his holiness use all your power
    To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.[560]
    Our discontented counties do revolt;
    Our people quarrel with obedience,
    Swearing allegiance and the love of soul[561]                        10
    To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
    This inundation of mistemper'd humour[562]
    Rests by you only to be qualified:
    Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
    That present medicine must be minister'd,                            15
    Or overthrow incurable ensues.[563]

    _Pand._ It was my breath that blew this tempest up.
    Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
    But since you are a gentle convertite,
    My tongue shall hush again this storm of war                         20
    And make fair weather in your blustering land.
    On this Ascension-day, remember well,
    Upon your oath of service to the pope,
    Go I to make the French lay down their arms.                [_Exit._

    _K. John._ Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet                25
    Say that before Ascension-day at noon
    My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
    I did suppose it should be on constraint;
    But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.

                          _Enter the_ BASTARD.

    _Bast._ All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out               30
    But Dover Castle: London hath received,
    Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:
    Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
    To offer service to your enemy,
    And wild amazement hurries up and down[564]                          35
    The little number of your doubtful friends.[565]

    _K. John._ Would not my lords return to me again,
    After they heard young Arthur was alive?

    _Bast._ They found him dead and cast into the streets.
    An empty casket, where the jewel of life[566]                        40
    By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.

    _K. John._ That villain Hubert told me he did live.

    _Bast._ So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
    But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
    Be great in act, as you have been in thought;                        45
    Let not the world see fear and sad distrust[567]
    Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
    Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;[568]
    Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
    Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,                          50
    That borrow their behaviours from the great,
    Grow great by your example and put on
    The dauntless spirit of resolution.
    Away, and glister like the god of war,
    When he intendeth to become the field:                               55
    Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
    What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
    And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
    O, let it not be said: forage, and run[569]
    To meet displeasure farther from the doors,                          60
    And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.

    _K. John._ The legate of the pope hath been with me,
    And I have made a happy peace with him;
    And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
    Led by the Dauphin.

    _Bast._ O inglorious league!                                         65
    Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
    Send fair-play orders and make compromise,[570]
    Insinuation, parley and base truce
    To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
    A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,                          70
    And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
    Mocking the air with colours idly spread,[571]
    And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms:
    Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;[572]
    Or if he do, let it at least be said                                 75
    They saw we had a purpose of defence.

    _K. John._ Have thou the ordering of this present time.

    _Bast._ Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
    Our party may well meet a prouder foe.                    [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _The_ DAUPHIN'S _Camp at St Edmundsbury_.

      _Enter, in arms_, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT,
                          _and_ Soldiers.[573]

    _Lew._ My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,
    And keep it safe for our remembrance:
    Return the precedent to these lords again;
    That, having our fair order written down,
    Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,                          5
    May know wherefore we took the sacrament
    And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.

    _Sal._ Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
    And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
    A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith[574]                           10
    To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
    I am not glad that such a sore of time
    Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,[575]
    And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
    By making many. O, it grieves my soul,                               15
    That I must draw this metal from my side
    To be a widow-maker! O, and there
    Where honourable rescue and defence
    Cries out upon the name of Salisbury![576]
    But such is the infection of the time,                               20
    That, for the health and physic of our right,
    We cannot deal but with the very hand
    Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
    And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,
    That we, the sons and children of this isle,                         25
    Were born to see so sad an hour as this;[577]
    Wherein we step after a stranger march[578]
    Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
    Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
    Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--[579]                         30
    To grace the gentry of a land remote,
    And follow unacquainted colours here?
    What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
    That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
    Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,[580]                  35
    And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;[581]
    Where these two Christian armies might combine
    The blood of malice in a vein of league,[582]
    And not to spend it so unneighbourly![583]

    _Lew._ A noble temper dost thou show in this;                        40
    And great affections wrestling in thy bosom[584]
    Doth make an earthquake of nobility.[585]
    O, what a noble combat hast thou fought[586]
    Between compulsion and a brave respect![587]
    Let me wipe off this honourable dew,                                 45
    That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
    My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
    Being an ordinary inundation;
    But this effusion of such manly drops,
    This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,                        50
    Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
    Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
    Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
    Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
    And with a great heart heave away this storm:                        55
    Commend these waters to those baby eyes[588]
    That never saw the giant world enraged;
    Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
    Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.[589]
    Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep                   60
    Into the purse of rich prosperity
    As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
    That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
    And even there, methinks, an angel spake:

                         _Enter_ PANDULPH.[590]

    Look, where the holy legate comes apace,                             65
    To give us warrant from the hand of heaven,
    And on our actions set the name of right
    With holy breath.

    _Pand._            Hail, noble prince of France![591]
    The next is this, King John hath reconciled
    Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,                              70
    That so stood out against the holy church,
    The great metropolis and see of Rome:
    Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;
    And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
    That, like a lion foster'd up at hand,                               75
    It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
    And be no further harmful than in show.

    _Lew._ Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
    I am too high-born to be propertied,
    To be a secondary at control,                                        80
    Or useful serving-man and instrument,
    To any sovereign state throughout the world.
    Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars[592]
    Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
    And brought in matter that should feed this fire;                    85
    And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
    With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
    You taught me how to know the face of right,
    Acquainted me with interest to this land,[593]
    Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;                           90
    And come ye now to tell me John hath made
    His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
    I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
    After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
    And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back                           95
    Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
    Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
    What men provided, what munition sent,
    To underprop this action? Is't not I
    That undergo this charge? who else but I,                           100
    And such as to my claim are liable,
    Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
    Have I not heard these islanders shout out
    'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
    Have I not here the best cards for the game,                        105
    To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
    And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
    No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.[594]

    _Pand._ You look but on the outside of this work.

    _Lew._ Outside or inside, I will not return                         110
    Till my attempt so much be glorified
    As to my ample hope was promised
    Before I drew this gallant head of war,
    And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,
    To outlook conquest and to win renown                               115
    Even in the jaws of danger and of death.     [_Trumpet sounds._[595]
    What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?

                 _Enter the_ BASTARD, _attended_.[596]

    _Bast._ According to the fair play of the world,[597]
    Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:[598]
    My holy lord of Milan, from the king[598]                           120
    I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;[598]
    And, as you answer, I do know the scope
    And warrant limited unto my tongue.

    _Pand._ The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,[599]
    And will not temporize with my entreaties;[600]                     125
    He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.

    _Bast._ By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
    The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
    For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
    He is prepared, and reason too he should:[601]                      130
    This apish and unmannerly approach,
    This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
    This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,[602]
    The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
    To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,[603]                   135
    From out the circle of his territories.
    That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
    To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
    To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
    To crouch in litter of your stable planks,                          140
    To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
    To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out[604]
    In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
    Even at the crying of your nation's crow,[605]
    Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;[606]                        145
    Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
    That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
    No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
    And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,[607]
    To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.                        150
    And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,[608]
    You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
    Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
    For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
    Like Amazons come tripping after drums,                             155
    Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,[609]
    Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts[610]
    To fierce and bloody inclination.

    _Lew._ There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
    We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;[611]               160
    We hold our time too precious to be spent
    With such a brabbler.[612]

    _Pand._                 Give me leave to speak.

    _Bast._ No, I will speak.

    _Lew._                    We will attend to neither.
    Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
    Plead for our interest and our being here.                          165

    _Bast._ Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
    And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
    An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
    And even at hand a drum is ready braced
    That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;[613]                   170
    Sound but another, and another shall
    As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
    And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,
    Not trusting to this halting legate here,
    Whom he hath used rather for sport than need,                       175
    Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
    A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day[614]
    To feast upon whole thousands of the French.

    _Lew._ Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.

    _Bast._ And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.              180

                                                              [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _The field of battle._

             _Alarums. Enter_ KING JOHN _and_ HUBERT.[615]

    _K. John._ How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.

    _Hub._ Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?

    _K. John._ This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
    Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Mess._ My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,                 5
    Desires your majesty to leave the field
    And send him word by me which way you go.

    _K. John._ Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.[616]

    _Mess._ Be of good comfort; for the great supply
    That was expected by the Dauphin here,                               10
    Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.[617]
    This news was brought to Richard but even now:
    The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.

    _K. John._ Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,[618]
    And will not let me welcome this good news.                          15
    Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;[616]
    Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.                   [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _Another part of the field._[619]

               _Enter_ SALISBURY, PEMBROKE, _and_ BIGOT.

    _Sal._ I did not think the king so stored with friends.

    _Pem._ Up once again; put spirit in the French:[620]
    If they miscarry, we miscarry too.[620]

    _Sal._ That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
    In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.                             5

    _Pem._ They say King John sore sick hath left the field.

                       _Enter_ MELUN, _wounded_.

    _Mel._ Lead me to the revolts of England here.

    _Sal._ When we were happy we had other names.

    _Pem._ It is the Count Melun.

    _Sal._                        Wounded to death.

    _Mel._ Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;                  10
    Unthread the rude eye of rebellion[621]
    And welcome home again discarded faith.
    Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
    For if the French be lords of this loud day,[622]
    He means to recompense the pains you take                            15
    By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
    And I with him, and many moe with me,[623]
    Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;[624]
    Even on that altar where we swore to you
    Dear amity and everlasting love.                                     20

    _Sal._ May this be possible? may this be true?

    _Mel._ Have I not hideous death within my view,
    Retaining but a quantity of life,
    Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
    Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?[625]                     25
    What in the world should make me now deceive,
    Since I must lose the use of all deceit?[626]
    Why should I then be false, since it is true
    That I must die here and live hence by truth?
    I say again, if Lewis do win the day,[627]                           30
    He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours
    Behold another day break in the east:
    But even this night, whose black contagious breath
    Already smokes about the burning crest[628]
    Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,                              35
    Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
    Paying the fine of rated treachery[629]
    Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
    If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
    Commend me to one Hubert with your king:                             40
    The love of him, and this respect besides,
    For that my grandsire was an Englishman,[630]
    Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
    In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
    From forth the noise and rumour of the field,                        45
    Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
    In peace, and part this body and my soul
    With contemplation and devout desires.

    _Sal._ We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
    But I do love the favour and the form                                50
    Of this most fair occasion, by the which
    We will untread the steps of damned flight,
    And like a bated and retired flood,[631]
    Leaving our rankness and irregular course,[632]
    Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd[633]                55
    And calmly run on in obedience
    Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
    My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
    For I do see the cruel pangs of death[634]
    Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;[635]               60
    And happy newness, that intends old right.[636]

                                           [_Exeunt, leading off Melun._


SCENE V. _The French camp._[637]

                     _Enter_ LEWIS _and his train_.

    _Lew._ The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
    But stay'd, and made the western welkin blush,
    When English measure backward their own ground[638]
    In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
    When with a volley of our needless shot,                              5
    After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
    And wound our tattering colours clearly up,[639]
    Last in the field, and almost lords of it!

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Mess._ Where is my prince, the Dauphin?[640]

    _Lew._                                   Here: what news?

    _Mess._ The Count Melun is slain; the English lords                  10
    By his persuasion are again fall'n off,[641]
    And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,[642]
    Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.

    _Lew._ Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
    I did not think to be so sad to-night[643]                           15
    As this hath made me. Who was he that said
    King John did fly an hour or two before
    The stumbling night did part our weary powers?

    _Mess._ Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.

    _Lew._ Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:               20
    The day shall not be up so soon as I,
    To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.                   [_Exeunt._


SCENE VI. _An open place in the neighbourhood of Swinstead
Abbey._[644]

             _Enter the_ BASTARD _and_ HUBERT, _severally_.

    _Hub._ Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.

    _Bast._ A friend. What art thou?

    _Hub._                           Of the part of England.

    _Bast._ Whither dost thou go?[645][646]

    _Hub._ What's that to thee? why may not I demand[646][647]
    Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?[646][647]                  5

    _Bast._ Hubert, I think?[646][647]

    _Hub._ Thou hast a perfect thought:
    I will upon all hazards well believe
    Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.
    Who art thou?

    _Bast._ Who thou wilt: and if thou please,[648]
    Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think                           10
    I come one way of the Plantagenets.

    _Hub._ Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night[649]
    Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
    That any accent breaking from thy tongue
    Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.                     15

    _Bast._ Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?

    _Hub._ Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
    To find you out.

    _Bast._    Brief, then; and what's the news?

    _Hub._ O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
    Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.                            20

    _Bast._ Show me the very wound of this ill news:
    I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.[650]

    _Hub._ The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:
    I left him almost speechless; and broke out
    To acquaint you with this evil, that you might                       25
    The better arm you to the sudden time,
    Than if you had at leisure known of this.[651]

    _Bast._ How did he take it? who did taste to him?

    _Hub._ A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
    Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king                            30
    Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.

    _Bast._ Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?[652]

    _Hub._ Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,[653]
    And brought Prince Henry in their company;
    At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,                        35
    And they are all about his majesty.

    _Bast._ Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
    And tempt us not to bear above our power!
    I'll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,[654]
    Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;                          40
    These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
    Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.[655]
    Away before: conduct me to the king;
    I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.[656]        [_Exeunt._


SCENE VII. _The orchard in Swinstead Abbey._[657]

             _Enter Prince_ HENRY, SALISBURY, _and_ BIGOT.

    _P. Hen._ It is too late: the life of all his blood
    Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,[658]
    Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
    Doth by the idle comments that it makes
    Foretell the ending of mortality.                                     5

                           _Enter_ PEMBROKE.

    _Pem._ His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
    That, being brought into the open air,
    It would allay the burning quality
    Of that fell poison which assaileth him.

    _P. Hen._ Let him be brought into the orchard here.[659]             10
    Doth he still rage?                                   [_Exit Bigot._

    _Pem._                He is more patient
    Than when you left him; even now he sung.

    _P. Hen._ O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
    In their continuance will not feel themselves.[660]
    Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,[661]                    15
    Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now[662]
    Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds[663]
    With many legions of strange fantasies,
    Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
    Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death should sing.            20
    I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,[664]
    Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
    And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
    His soul and body to their lasting rest.[665]

    _Sal._ Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born                  25
    To set a form upon that indigest
    Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.

      _Enter_ Attendants, _and_ BIGOT, _carrying_ KING JOHN _in a
                             chair_.[666]

    _K. John._ Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
    It would not out at windows nor at doors.
    There is so hot a summer in my bosom,                                30
    That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
    I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
    Upon a parchment, and against this fire[667]
    Do I shrink up.[667]

    _P. Hen._ How fares your majesty?

    _K. John._ Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:[668]        35
    And none of you will bid the winter come
    To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
    Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
    Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
    To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips                         40
    And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,[669]
    I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait[670]
    And so ingrateful, you deny me that.[671]

    _P. Hen._ O that there were some virtue in my tears,
    That might relieve you!

    _K. John._                The salt in them is hot.[672]              45
    Within me is a hell; and there the poison
    Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
    On unreprieveable condemned blood.[673]

                          _Enter the_ BASTARD.

    _Bast._ O, I am scalded with my violent motion,[674]
    And spleen of speed to see your majesty!                             50

    _K. John._ O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:
    The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
    And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
    Are turned to one thread, one little hair:
    My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,                         55
    Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
    And then all this thou seest is but a clod
    And module of confounded royalty.[675]

    _Bast._ The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
    Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;[676]                  60
    For in a night the best part of my power,
    As I upon advantage did remove,
    Were in the Washes all unwarily[677]
    Devoured by the unexpected flood.             [_The king dies._[678]

    _Sal._ You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.                65
    My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.

    _P. Hen._ Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
    What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,[679]
    When this was now a king, and now is clay?[679]

    _Bast._ Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind                       70
    To do the office for thee of revenge,
    And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
    As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
    Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,[680]
    Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,                   75
    And instantly return with me again,
    To push destruction and perpetual shame
    Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
    Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
    The Dauphin rages at our very heels.                                 80

    _Sal._ It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
    The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
    Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
    And brings from him such offers of our peace[681]
    As we with honour and respect may take,                              85
    With purpose presently to leave this war.

    _Bast._ He will the rather do it when he sees
    Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.[682]

    _Sal._ Nay, it is in a manner done already;[683]
    For many carriages he hath dispatch'd                                90
    To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
    To the disposing of the cardinal:
    With whom yourself, myself and other lords,
    If you think meet, this afternoon will post
    To consummate this business happily.                                 95

    _Bast._ Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
    With other princes that may best be spared,[684]
    Shall wait upon your father's funeral.

    _P. Hen._ At Worcester must his body be interr'd;[685]
    For so he will'd it.

    _Bast._                Thither shall it then:                       100
    And happily may your sweet self put on
    The lineal state and glory of the land!
    To whom, with all submission, on my knee
    I do bequeath my faithful services
    And true subjection everlastingly.                                  105

    _Sal._ And the like tender of our love we make,
    To rest without a spot for evermore.[686]

    _P. Hen._ I have a kind soul that would give you thanks[687]
    And knows not how to do it but with tears.

    _Bast._ O, let us pay the time but needful woe,[688]                110
    Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
    This England never did, nor never shall,[689]
    Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
    But when it first did help to wound itself.
    Now these her princes are come home again,[690]                     115
    Come the three corners of the world in arms,
    And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,[691]
    If England to itself do rest but true.                    [_Exeunt._

NOTES.


NOTE I.

DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. In our enumeration of the Dramatis Personæ we have
given no further description of each than might be derived from the
Play itself.

In the stage directions of the Folios _Queen Elinor_ is variously
indicated as _Elinor, Eli., Ele., Elen., Elea., Queen, Qu., Old Qu.,_
and _Qu. Mo.; Philip Faulconbridge_ as _Philip_ or _Phil._ to I.
1. 132, afterwards _Bast_, except in III. 1. 133, 135, where he is
called _Phil.; King Philip_ is termed _King_ or _Kin._, and, in
the scenes where King John is also present, _France_ or _Fra.; King
John_ is designated as _K. John, John_, and once, III. 1. 324, _Eng.;
Lewis_ is called in the 'entrances' _Daulphin_ or _Dolphin_, and in
the dialogue _Lewis_, _Dol._, or _Dolph_. As we do not conceive our
rule of modernizing the spelling to apply to proper names we have
not substituted _Falconbridge_ for _Faulconbridge_, the consistent
spelling of the Folio. In the old play it is spelt as consistently
_Fauconbridge_.


NOTE II.

SCENE. We have not followed Capell and the more recent editors in
attempting to define the precise spot at which each scene took place,
where none is mentioned in the body of the play or in the stage
directions of the Folio. Nothing is gained by an attempt to harmonize
the plot with historical facts gathered from Holinshed and elsewhere,
when it is plain that Shakespeare was either ignorant of them or
indifferent to minute accuracy. For example, the second scene of Act
IV. is supposed to occur at the same place as the first scene of that
act, or, at all events, in the immediate neighbourhood (IV. 2. 85),
and in England (II. 3. 71 and IV. 2. 110). But Holinshed distinctly
states that Arthur was imprisoned first at Falaise and then at Rouen
(pp. 554, 555. ed. 1577).

The whole play is divided into Acts and Scenes in the first Folio, but
arbitrarily. The second act is made to consist of a single scene of 74
lines, and ends in what Theobald has clearly shewn to be the middle of
a scene. He, with 'Gildon and others', once supposed the close of the
second act to be lost, but afterwards changed his mind and adopted the
arrangement we have followed.


NOTE III.

I. 1. 20. This line must probably be scanned as an Alexandrine, reading
the first 'Controlment' in the time of a trisyllable and the second as
a quadrisyllable.


NOTE IV.

I. 1. 43. Here Steevens gives the same stage direction as Capell,
'_Enter the Sheriff of Northamptonshire and whispers Essex_,' changing
merely '_and_' to '_who_,' and, as usual, ignoring Capell, says in a
note that he had taken it from the Old Quarto. He convicts himself of
plagiarism, for the 'Old Quarto' has '_Enter the Shrive and whispers
the Earle of_ Salis. _in the care_.' It was Capell who changed 'Salis.'
to '_Essex_.' All the three editions of the Old Quarto agree in this
stage direction _literatim_, except that the edition of 1591 has
'_Sals._' for 'Salis.' Salisbury introduces the sheriff thus: 'Please
it your Majesty, here is the shrive of Northampton-shire, &c.'


NOTE V.

I. 1. 75. 'Whether.' Here the first three Folios read 'Where.' In
the _Comedy of Errors_, IV. 1. 60, all the Folios agreed in reading
'whe'r.' In both cases we spell 'whether.' The Folios are not
consistent. They have, for instance, 'Whether' in line 134 of the
present scene, 'Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge.' As we
do not contract the words 'either,' 'neither,' 'mother,' 'brother,'
'hither,' 'thither,' &c. when pronounced in the time of a monosyllable,
so we abstain from contracting 'whether', especially as such
contraction might cause ambiguity in the sense.


NOTE VI.

I. 1. 85. In Mr Wilbraham's MS. notes the following occurs:

'Trick' is a term in Heraldry for a 'copy.' In the _Gentleman's
Magazine_ for 1803, Supplement, p. 1207, in an account of various
memorandums of Receipts and Expenditures, &c., by some one at the
latter end of the 17th century, I find the three following ones:

  July 21st, 1691.  Received of Mr Cole for a _trick_ of Consure's arms.
                      2_s._ 6_d._

  -- 25th --        Mr Martyn, the Paynter, for a _trick_ of the Lady Cath.
                      Darnley's arms. 2_s._ 6_d._

  Dec. 18th --      Received of Mr Gentry for a _trick_ of Wyatt's arms.
                      2_s._ 6_d._


NOTE VII.

I. 1. 147. This discrepancy between the readings of the first and
second Folios had escaped Capell's notice. In _Twelfth Night_, II. 4.
88, all the Folios read 'It' for 'I.'


NOTE VIII.

II. 1. 103. 'Large,' which was doubtless a misprint for 'huge' in
Rowe's edition, remained uncorrected by Pope, Theobald, Hanmer,
Warburton, and Johnson, though Grey noticed the mistake (_Notes_, 1. p.
230). Capell restored the true reading. How great his services were in
the restoration of the text may be estimated by the following instances
collected from the present play alone. And the list might have been
very much extended if we had included all his minute corrections:

II. 1. 175, 'call not me;' II. 1. 176, 'dominations;' II. 1. 213,
'preparation;' II. 1. 345, 'lay down;' III. 1. 24, 'signs;' III. 4. 35,
'buss;' III. 4. 137, 'whiles;' III. 4. 139, 'one;' III. 4. 169, 'that;'
IV. 1. 31, 'I warrant;' IV. 3. 66, 'his;' IV. 3. 112, 'savours;' V. 7.
43, 'ingrateful.' In V. 7. 45, however, he omitted to correct 'of them.'


NOTE IX.

II. 1. 149. This line is printed in the Folios as if it were a part
of Austria's speech. The objections are of course, first, that Lewis
was not a king, and secondly, that Austria would rather have appealed
to Lewis's father. Malone once thought that Austria appealed to both
'King,--Lewis, &c.' The objection to the usual emendation is that
throughout the scene King Philip is not designated in the stage
directions as _King_, but as _Fran._ or _Fra._


NOTE X.

II. 1. 187. The whole passage from line 185 to 188, inclusive, is thus
printed in F₁:

    'But God hath made her sinne and her, the plague
    On this remoued issue, plagued for her,
    And with her plague her sinne: his iniury
    Her iniurie the Beadle to her sinne,'

Capell has it as follows:

    'But God hath made her sin and her the plague
    On this removed issue, plagu'd for her;
    And, with her sin, her plague, his injury
    Her injury, the beadle to her sin:'

Mr Roby, whose punctuation we have adopted, says, "I suppose the
sense to be: 'God hath made her sin and herself to be a plague to
this distant child, who is punished for her and with the punishment
belonging to her: God has made her sin to be an injury to Arthur, and
her injurious deeds to be the executioner to punish her sin; all which
(viz. her first sin and her now injurious deeds) are punished in the
person of this child.'"

Mr Lloyd, who, with the same punctuation, would read, 'her sin, her
injury,' interprets thus: 'Elinor's injuries to Arthur are God's agents
to punish him both for the sin of being her grandchild and for the
inherited guilt of these very injuries.'

The word 'sin' is twice printed by mistake for 'son' in Johnson's note
to this passage, Ed. 1765.

Malone supposed that two half lines had been lost after the words, "And
with her."


NOTE XI.

II. 1. 268. This line, with the substitution of 'this' for 'our,' is
taken from a prose passage of the old play, _The troublesome Raigne of
King John_, Sig. C. 3. recto, ed. 1622. The names of the provinces
given in II. 1. 525, 526, came also from the old play (Sig. D. verso).
The line, 'For that my grandsire was an Englishman,' V. 4. 42, is found
in the old play, Sig. K. 4. recto.

In a few other passages, as for instance in II. 1. 65, there is an
almost verbal identity between Shakespeare and his predecessor.


NOTE XII.

II. 1. 289. Capell's copy of the second Folio has _sit's on's_; that
which belonged to Dr Long has _it' son's_.


NOTE XIII.

II. 1. 300. The word '_Heere_,' used in the stage direction, seems
to indicate that the scene was supposed to continue. No new scene is
marked in the Folios. Mr Dyce and Mr Grant White have followed their
authority.


NOTE XIV.

II. 1. 325. Mr Knight alone of modern editors retains _Hubert_,
supposing this citizen of Angiers to be the same person as Arthur's
gaoler. But in the old play the citizen who proposes the league to the
two kings is a distinct person from Hubert de Burgh. It is much more
probable that the name _Hubert_ has crept in here from the fact that
the same actor who was to play Hubert played also the part of 'First
citizen.'


NOTE XV.

III. 1. 69. In Boswell's edition (1821) the reading '_its_ owner stoop'
is derived from a misprint of Johnson, who quotes it as the reading of
the old editions. Mr Collier incorrectly attributes it to Malone.


NOTE XVI.

III. 1. 133. Pope inserts after this line the following passage,
adapted from the old play of _The troublesome Raigne of King John_:

    '_Aust._ Methinks that Richard's pride and Richard's fall
    Should be a precedent to fright you, Sir.

    _Bast._ What words are these? how do my sinews shake!
    My father's foe clad in my father's spoil!
    How doth Alecto whisper in my ears;
    Delay not, Richard, kill the villain strait,
    Disrobe him of the matchless monument,
    Thy father's triumph o'er the savages--
    Now by his soul I swear, my father's soul,
    Twice will I not review the morning's rise,
    Till I have torn that trophy from thy back,
    And split thy heart, for wearing it so long.'


NOTE XVII.

III. 1. 260. Mr Staunton says, in his note on this passage, '_Chafed_
was first suggested by Mr Dyce.' It is found first in Theobald, who
is followed by Hanmer, Warburton, Johnson, and Capell. Steevens, who
mentioned it, returned to the old reading, 'cased.'


NOTE XVIII.

III. 1. 280-286. In the first Folio this passage stands thus:

    'It is religion that doth make vowes kept,
    But thou hast sworne against religion:
    By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
    And mak'st an oath the suretie for thy truth,
    Against an oath the truth, thou art vnsure
    To sweare, sweares onely not be forsworne,
    Else what a mockerie should it be to sweare?'

Mr Staunton suggests the following as 'a probable reading of the
passage in its original form:'

    'It is religion that doth make vows kept,
    But thou hast sworn against religion:
    By that, thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
    And mak'st an oath, the surety for thy truth,
    Against an oath, the proof thou art unsure.
    Who swears swears only not to be forsworn,
    Else what a mockery should it be to swear!'

In line 285 Mr Halliwell appears to adopt _swear'st_ in his note,
though he leaves _swears_ in the text.


NOTE XIX.

III. 2. 4. After this line Pope inserts the following from the old play
before quoted:

    'Thus hath king Richard's son perform'd his vow,
    And offer'd Austria's blood for sacrifice
    Unto his father's ever-living soul.'


NOTE XX.

III. 4. 41, 42. Mr Lloyd writes to us with reference to the speech of
Constance: 'I think the two last lines are a first and second draught,
the latter intended to replace the former, and both printed together by
mistake.'


NOTE XXI.

III. 4. 159. As Pope's correction, however ingenious and plausible,
cannot be pronounced certain, we, in accordance with the general rule
laid down in the Preface to Vol. I., p. xii, retain the reading of
the Folios. 'Scope of Nature' may mean anything which lies within the
limits of Nature's power.


NOTE XXII.

IV. 1. 70. Warburton, after quoting Pope's reading, which he adopts,
remarks: "Thus Mr Pope found the line in the old editions.... Mr
Theobald, by what authority I don't know, reads:

    'I would not have believ'd him: no tongue, but Hubert's,'

which is spoiling the measure without much mending the sense." Johnson
adds, 'I do not see why the old reading may not stand. Mr Theobald's
alteration, as we find, injures the measure, &c.' Neither Warburton nor
Johnson could have consulted the Folios on this passage, or they would
have seen that Pope's reading is not the reading of the old editions,
and that Theobald's 'unauthorized alteration' was merely a return to
the original text.


NOTE XXIII.

IV. 2. 50. Sidney Walker (_Criticisms_, I. 279) questions the
possibility of Shakespeare having written so ungrammatically. The
construction is evidently incorrect, but it may be explained by
supposing that the offending word 'them,' following so closely upon
'my self,' was suggested to the writer by the analogous pronoun
'themselves.'


NOTE XXIV.

IV. 2. 117. It is extremely doubtful whether the reading of the first
Folio in this passage is 'eare' or 'care'. The first letter of the word
is broken, but we are inclined to believe that is a broken 'e' and not
a broken 'c', and in this we are supported by the opinion of Sir F.
Madden and Mr Hamilton. Mr Staunton informs us that in Lord Ellesmere's
Folio, it is more like a defective Italic _e_ than any other letter,
but in the two copies of F₁ before us it is certainly Roman, whether
'c' or 'e'. On the other hand, Mr Charles Wright is in favour of an
italic _c_. Under these circumstances, we have left 'care' in the text.


NOTE XXV.

IV. 3. 33. Mr Collier mentions that the Duke of Devonshire's copy of
the first Folio reads 'man' instead of 'mans,' which is in the ordinary
copies. The error was corrected no doubt while the sheet was passing
through the press, and after some copies had been struck off, in
accordance with the practice which was common in printing-offices at
the beginning of the 17th century.


NOTE XXVI.

V. 2. 64. 'And even there, methinks, an angel spake.' None of
the interpretations of this line hitherto suggested are at all
satisfactory. Surely the close proximity of 'purse,' 'nobles,' and
'angel,' shews that Shakespeare has here yielded to the fascination of
a _jeu de mots_, which he was unable to resist, however unsuitable
the occasion might be. The Dauphin, we may suppose, speaks 'aside,'
with an accent and gesture which mark his contempt for the mercenary
allies whom he intends to get rid of as soon as may be. See V. 4. 30-39.


NOTE XXVII.

V. 3. 8, 17. There can be no doubt, as has been pointed out to us by Mr
Hopkinson of Stamford, that 'Swinstead' is an error for 'Swineshead,'
the place of King John's death. The same fact was communicated to Reed
by Mr Dodd, the then vicar of Swineshead. But as the mistake occurs in
the old Quarto, which Shakespeare follows, we have not felt justified
in removing it from the text.


NOTE XXVIII.

V. 4. 14. Sidney Walker (_Criticisms_, II. 234) suggests as another
solution of the difficulty in this passage that a line may have been
lost after 'loud day.' Mr Keightley has independently made the same
conjecture. In support of the reading which we propose, 'lord' for
'lords,' we would refer to _Hen. V_. IV. 4, where 'the French' is used
in the singular; '_the French_ might have a good prey of us if _he_
knew of it.'


NOTE XXIX.

V. 5. 7. In Capell's copy of his own edition 'clearly' is corrected to
'chearly,' in accordance with the conjecture in his notes. In the same
way he altered 'compulsion' to 'compunction' in V. 2. 44. 'Cleanly' is
equivalent to 'neatly,' and seems to be appropriate as antithetical to
'tottering' or 'tattering.'


NOTE XXX.

V. 7. 2. Mr Grant White says that the Folio reads 'pore' for 'pure,'
and this suggests his own reading, 'poor.' In all the copies known to
us the reading is 'pure.'


NOTE XXXI.

V. 7. 97. Sidney Walker (_Criticisms_, I. p. 293) is of opinion that
the word 'princes' is a corruption, the transcriber's or compositor's
eye having been caught by the word 'prince' in the preceding line. Or
the error may be in the word 'prince,' for which it would be easier
to suggest a substitute than for 'princes.' As an illustration of the
facility with which such mistakes may be made we may mention that
Sidney Walker himself, quoting _King John_, IV. 3. 44, 45:

                'Could thought without this object
    Form such another?'

wrote inadvertently 'such object.' In another place, as Mr Lettsom
remarks, he wrote '_Swings_ on his horse back' for '_Sits_ ...,' the
word 'swinged' of the previous line being in his eye or his mind.


NOTE XXXII.

V. 7. 115. Mr Lloyd suspects that this line is spurious: 'A compliment
to Steenie and Baby Charles, who came back from Madrid in the year
that the first edition of King John was published, and thrust in by
the editors, or perhaps by the actors, in place of a line of similar
purport, but less applicable.'

ACT I.


SCENE I. _London_. KING RICHARD'S _palace_.

     _Enter_ KING RICHARD, JOHN of GAUNT, _with other_ Nobles _and_
                            Attendants.[692]

    _K. Rich._ Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
    Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,[693]
    Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,[694]
    Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
    Which then our leisure would not let us hear,[695]                    5
    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?[696]

    _Gaunt._ I have, my liege.

    _K. Rich._ Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
    If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;[697]
    Or worthily, as a good subject should,                               10
    On some known ground of treachery in him?

    _Gaunt._ As near as I could sift him on that argument,
    On some apparent danger seen in him
    Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.

    _K. Rich._ Then call them to our presence; face to face,[698]        15
    And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
    The accuser and the accused freely speak:[699]
    High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
    In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

                _Enter_ BOLINGBROKE _and_ MOWBRAY.[700]

    _Boling._ Many years of happy days befal[701]                        20
    My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!

    _Mow._ Each day still better other's happiness;
    Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
    Add an immortal title to your crown![702]

    _K. Rich._ We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,               25
    As well appeareth by the cause you come;[703]
    Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.[704]
    Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

    _Boling._ First, heaven be the record to my speech!                  30
    In the devotion of a subject's love,[705]
    Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
    And free from other misbegotten hate,[706]
    Come I appellant to this princely presence.[707]
    Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,                              35
    And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
    My body shall make good upon this earth,
    Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.[708]
    Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
    Too good to be so and too bad to live,[709]                          40
    Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,[709]
    The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.[709]
    Once more, the more to aggravate the note,[709][710]
    With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;[709]
    And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,[709]                   45
    What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.[709]

    _Mow._ Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:[711]
    'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
    The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
    Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;                           50
    The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
    Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
    As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:[712]
    First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
    From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;                       55
    Which else would post until it had return'd[713]
    These terms of treason doubled down his throat.[714]
    Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
    And let him be no kinsman to my liege,[715]
    I do defy him, and I spit at him;[716]                               60
    Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
    Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
    And meet him, were I tied to run afoot[717]
    Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
    Or any other ground inhabitable,[718]                                65
    Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.[719]
    Mean time let this defend my loyalty,[720]
    By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

    _Boling._ Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
    Disclaiming here the kindred of the king;[721]                       70
    And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
    Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
    If guilty dread have left thee so much strength[722]
    As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
    By that and all the rites of knighthood else,[723]                   75
    Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
    What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.[724]

    _Mow._ I take it up; and by that sword I swear,
    Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
    I'll answer thee in any fair degree,                                 80
    Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:[725]
    And when I mount, alive may I not light,[726]
    If I be traitor or unjustly fight!

    _K. Rich._ What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
    It must be great that can inherit us[727]                            85
    So much as of a thought of ill in him.

    _Boling._ Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;[728]
    That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
    In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
    The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,                     90
    Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
    Besides I say and will in battle prove,
    Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
    That ever was survey'd by English eye,
    That all the treasons for these eighteen years[729]                  95
    Complotted and contrived in this land
    Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.[730]
    Further I say and further will maintain
    Upon his bad life to make all this good,[731]
    That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,[732]               100
    Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
    And consequently, like a traitor coward,[733]
    Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
    Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
    Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,                      105
    To me for justice and rough chastisement;
    And, by the glorious worth of my descent,[734]
    This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.

    _K. Rich._ How high a pitch his resolution soars!
    Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?[735]                   110

    _Mow._ O, let my sovereign turn away his face,
    And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
    Till I have told this slander of his blood,[736]
    How God and good men hate so foul a liar.

    _K. Rich._ Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:                115
    Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,[737]
    As he is but my father's brother's son,[738]
    Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,[739]
    Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
    Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize                        120
    The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:[738]
    He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
    Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.

    _Mow._ Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
    Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.                125
    Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais[740]
    Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;[741]
    The other part reserved I by consent,
    For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
    Upon remainder of a dear account,[742]                              130
    Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
    Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,[732]
    I slew him not; but to my own disgrace[743]
    Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
    For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,                                135
    The honourable father to my foe,
    Once did I lay an ambush for your life,[744]
    A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
    But ere I last received the sacrament[745]
    I did confess it, and exactly begg'd                                140
    Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
    This is my fault: as for the rest appeal'd,
    It issues from the rancour of a villain,
    A recreant and most degenerate traitor:
    Which in myself I boldly will defend:                               145
    And interchangeably hurl down my gage[746]
    Upon this overweening traitor's foot,[747]
    To prove myself a loyal gentleman
    Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.[748]
    In haste whereof, most heartily I pray                              150
    Your highness to assign our trial day.

    _K. Rich._ Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;[749]
    Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
    This we prescribe, though no physician;[750][751]
    Deep malice makes too deep incision:[750]                           155
    Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;[750]
    Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.[750][752]
    Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
    We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.

    _Gaunt._ To be a make-peace shall become my age:                    160
    Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.

    _K. Rich._ And, Norfolk, throw down his.

    _Gaunt._                                 When, Harry, when?[753]
    Obedience bids I should not bid again.

    _K. Rich._ Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.

    _Mow._ Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.                165
    My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
    The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
    Despite of death that lives upon my grave,[754]
    To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
    I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here;                         170
    Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
    The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood[755]
    Which breathed this poison.

    _K. Rich._                    Rage must be withstood:
    Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.[756]

    _Mow._ Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame,[757]       175
    And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,[758]
    The purest treasure mortal times afford
    Is spotless reputation: that away,
    Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.[759]
    A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest[760]
    Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.                                 180
    Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;
    Take honour from me, and my life is done:
    Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
    In that I live and for that will I die.                             185

    _K. Rich_. Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.[761]

    _Boling_. O, God defend my soul from such deep sin![762]
    Shall I seem crest-fallen in my father's sight?
    Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height[763]
    Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue[764]                   190
    Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,[765]
    Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear[766]
    The slavish motive of recanting fear,
    And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
    Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.[767]              195

                                                          [_Exit Gaunt._

    _K. Rich._ We were not born to sue, but to command;
    Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
    Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,[768]
    At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:[769]
    There shall your swords and lances arbitrate                        200
    The swelling difference of your settled hate:
    Since we can not atone you, we shall see[770]
    Justice design the victor's chivalry.[771]
    Lord marshal, command our officers at arms[772]
    Be ready to direct these home alarms.              [_Exeunt._[773]  205


SCENE II. _The_ DUKE of LANCASTER'S _palace_.[774]

        _Enter_ JOHN of GAUNT _with the_ DUCHESS of GLOUCESTER.

    _Gaunt._ Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood[775]
    Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
    To stir against the butchers of his life!
    But since correction lieth in those hands
    Which made the fault that we cannot correct,                          5
    Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
    Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,[776]
    Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.[777]

    _Duch._ Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
    Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?                           10
    Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
    Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,[778]
    Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
    Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
    Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;                         15
    But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
    One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
    One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
    Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
    Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,[779]                20
    By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
    Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
    That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee[780]
    Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,[781]
    Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent                         25
    In some large measure to thy father's death,
    In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
    Who was the model of thy father's life.
    Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
    In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd.                     30
    Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,[782]
    Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
    That which in mean men we intitle patience
    Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.[783]
    What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,[784]                  35
    The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.[785]

    _Gaunt._ God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,[786]
    His deputy anointed in His sight,
    Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
    Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift[787]                        40
    An angry arm against His minister.

    _Duch._ Where then, alas, may I complain myself?[788]

    _Gaunt._ To God, the widow's champion and defence.[789]

    _Duch._ Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.[790]
    Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold[791]                         45
    Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:[792]
    O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,[792][793]
    That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast![794]
    Or, if misfortune miss the first career,[795]
    Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,                             50
    That they may break his foaming courser's back,
    And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
    A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford![792][796]
    Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife[797]
    With her companion grief must end her life.                          55

    _Gaunt._ Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
    As much good stay with thee as go with me!

    _Duch._ Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,[798]
    Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:[799]
    I take my leave before I have begun,                                 60
    For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
    Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.[800]
    Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
    Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
    I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--[801]                     65
    With all good speed at Plashy visit me.[802]
    Alack, and what shall good old York there see[803]
    But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?[804]                  70
    Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
    To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.[805]
    Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:[806]
    The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.              [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _The lists at Coventry._

        _Enter the_ Lord Marshal _and the_ DUKE of AUMERLE.[807]

    _Mar._ My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?[808]

    _Aum._ Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.

    _Mar._ The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,[809]
    Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.[810]

    _Aum._ Why, then, the champions are prepared and stay                 5
    For nothing but his majesty's approach.

    _The trumpets sound, and the_ KING _enters with his nobles_,
        GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, _and others. When they are set,
        enter_ MOWBRAY _in arms, defendant, with a_ Herald.[811]

    _K. Rich._ Marshal, demand of yonder champion
    The cause of his arrival here in arms:
    Ask him his name and orderly proceed
    To swear him in the justice of his cause.                            10

    _Mar._ In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
    And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
    Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:[812]
    Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;[813]
    As so defend thee heaven and thy valour![814]                        15

    _Mow._ My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;[815]
    Who hither come engaged by my oath--[816]
    Which God defend a knight should violate!--[817]
    Both to defend my loyalty and truth
    To God, my king and my succeeding issue,[818]                        20
    Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me;[819]
    And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
    To prove him, in defending of myself,
    A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
    And as I truly fight, defend me heaven![820]                         25

    _The trumpets sound. Enter_ BOLINGBROKE, _Appellant, in armour,
                            with a_ Herald.

    _K. Rich._ Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,[821]
    Both who he is and why he cometh hither
    Thus plated in habiliments of war,[822]
    And formally, according to our law,[823]
    Depose him in the justice of his cause.                              30

    _Mar._ What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
    Before King Richard in his royal lists?
    Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?[824]
    Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!

    _Boling._ Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby[825]                35
    Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,[826]
    To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,[827]
    In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,[828]
    That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,[829]
    To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;                            40
    And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

    _Mar._ On pain of death, no person be so bold
    Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,[830]
    Except the marshal and such officers
    Appointed to direct these fair designs.                              45

    _Boling._ Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
    And bow my knee before his majesty:
    For Mowbray and myself are like two men
    That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
    Then let us take a ceremonious leave                                 50
    And loving farewell of our several friends.

    _Mar._ The appellant in all duty greets your highness,[831]
    And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.

    _K. Rich._ We will descend and fold him in our arms.
    Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,[832]                      55
    So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
    Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
    Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.[833]

    _Boling._ O, let no noble eye profane a tear
    For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:[834]                     60
    As confident as is the falcon's flight
    Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
    Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
    Not sick, although I have to do with death,[835]                     65
    But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.[835][836]
    Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet[835]
    The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:[835][837]
    O thou, the earthly author of my blood,[838]
    Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,                             70
    Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up[839]
    To reach at victory above my head,[840]
    Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
    And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
    That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,[841]                         75
    And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,[842]
    Even in the lusty haviour of his son.[843]

    _Gaunt._ God in thy good cause make thee prosperous![844]
    Be swift like lightning in the execution;
    And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,[845]                            80
    Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
    Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:[846]
    Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.[847]

    _Boling._ Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive![848]

    _Mow._ However God or fortune cast my lot,[844]                      85
    There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,[849]
    A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
    Never did captive with a freer heart[850]
    Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
    His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement.                             90
    More than my dancing soul doth celebrate[851]
    This feast of battle with mine adversary.
    Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
    Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:[852]
    As gentle and as jocund as to jest[853]                              95
    Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

    _K. Rich._ Farewell, my lord: securely I espy
    Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
    Order the trial, marshal, and begin.

    _Mar._ Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,                      100
    Receive thy lance; and God defend the right![844][854]

    _Boling._ Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.

    _Mar._ Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.[855]

    _First Her._ Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,[856]
    Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,                     105
    On pain to be found false and recreant,
    To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
    A traitor to his God, his king and him;[857]
    And dares him to set forward to the fight.[858]

    _Sec. Her._ Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,[859]     110
    On pain to be found false and recreant,
    Both to defend himself and to approve[860]
    Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
    To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
    Courageously and with a free desire                                 115
    Attending but the signal to begin.

    _Mar._ Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.

                                               [_A charge sounded._[861]

    Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.[862]

    _K. Rich._ Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
    And both return back to their chairs again:                         120
    Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
    While we return these dukes what we decree.

                                                [_A long flourish._[863]

    Draw near,[864][865]
    And list what with our council we have done.[865]
    For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd                   125
    With that dear blood which it hath fostered;[866]
    And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
    Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;[867]
    And for we think the eagle-winged pride[868]
    Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,[868]                        130
    With rival-hating envy, set on you[868][869]
    To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle[868][870]
    Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;[868][871]
    Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,[872][873][874]
    With harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,[874][875]            135
    And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,[874][876]
    Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace,[873][874][877]
    And make us wade even in our kindred's blood;[874][878]
    Therefore, we banish you our territories:
    You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,[879]                       140
    Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields[880]
    Shall not regreet our fair dominions,[881]
    But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

    _Boling._ Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
    That sun that warms you here shall shine on me;                     145
    And those his golden beams to you here lent[882]
    Shall point on me and gild my banishment.

    _K. Rich._ Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,[883]
    Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
    The sly slow hours shall not determinate[884]                       150
    The dateless limit of thy dear exile;[885]
    The hopeless word of 'never to return'
    Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.[886]

    _Mow._ A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
    And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:                     155
    A dearer merit, not so deep a maim[887]
    As to be cast forth in the common air,
    Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
    The language I have learn'd these forty years,[888]
    My native English, now I must forego:                               160
    And now my tongue's use is to me no more
    Than an unstringed viol or a harp;
    Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
    Or, being open, put into his hands
    That knows no touch to tune the harmony:                            165
    Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,[889][890]
    Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;[889][891]
    And dull unfeeling barren ignorance[889]
    Is made my gaoler to attend on me.[889][892]
    I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,                                  170
    Too far in years to be a pupil now:
    What is thy sentence then but speechless death,[893]
    Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?

    _K. Rich._ It boots thee not to be compassionate:[894]
    After our sentence plaining comes too late.[895]                    175

    _Mow._ Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
    To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.[896]

    _K. Rich._ Return again, and take an oath with thee.[897]
    Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
    Swear by the duty that you owe to God--[898][899]                   180
    Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
    To keep the oath that we administer:
    You never shall, so help you truth and God![899][900]
    Embrace each other's love in banishment;
    Nor never look upon each other's face;[901]                         185
    Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile[901][902]
    This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;[903]
    Nor never by advised purpose meet[901]
    To plot, contrive, or complot any ill[904]
    'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.                   190

    _Boling._ I swear.[905]

    _Mow._ And I, to keep all this.[906]

    _Boling._ Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--[907]
    By this time, had the king permitted us,
    One of our souls had wander'd in the air,                           195
    Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
    As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
    Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;[908]
    Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
    The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.                              200

    _Mow._ No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
    My name be blotted from the book of life,
    And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
    But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;[899]
    And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.                       205
    Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;[909]
    Save back to England, all the world's my way.[909][910]      [_Exit._

    _K. Rich._ Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes[911]
    I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
    Hath from the number of his banish'd years                          210
    Pluck'd four away. [_To Boling._] Six frozen winters spent,[912]
    Return with welcome home from banishment.

    _Boling._ How long a time lies in one little word!
    Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
    End in a word: such is the breath of kings.[913]                    215

    _Gaunt._ I thank my liege, that in regard of me[914]
    He shortens four years of my son's exile:
    But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
    For, ere the six years that he hath to spend[915]
    Can change their moons and bring their times about,[916]            220
    My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
    Shall be extinct with age and endless night;[917]
    My inch of taper will be burnt and done,[918]
    And blindfold death not let me see my son.

    _K. Rich._ Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.                225

    _Gaunt._ But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
    Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,[919]
    And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
    Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
    But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;                              230
    Thy word is current with him for my death,
    But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.

    _K. Rich._ Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,[920]
    Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:[921]
    Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?[922]                  235

    _Gaunt._ Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.[923]
    You urged me as a judge; but I had rather[924]
    You would have bid me argue like a father.
    O, had it been a stranger, not my child,[925][926]
    To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:[925][927]         240
    A partial slander sought I to avoid,[925][928]
    And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.[925]
    Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
    I was too strict to make mine own away;
    But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue                           245
    Against my will to do myself this wrong.

    _K. Rich._ Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
    Six years we banish him, and he shall go.

                        [_Flourish. Exeunt King Richard and train._[929]

    _Aum._ Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,[930]
    From where you do remain let paper show.                            250

    _Mar._ My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
    As far as land will let me, by your side.

    _Gaunt._ O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
    That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?[931]

    _Boling._ I have too few to take my leave of you,                   255
    When the tongue's office should be prodigal
    To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.

    _Gaunt._ Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.

    _Boling._ Joy absent, grief is present for that time.

    _Gaunt._ What is six winters? they are quickly gone.                260

    _Boling._ To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.[932]

    _Gaunt._ Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.

    _Boling._ My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
    Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.

    _Gaunt._ The sullen passage of thy weary steps                      265
    Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set[933]
    The precious jewel of thy home return.

    _Boling._ Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make[934][935]
    Will but remember me what a deal of world[934][935][936]
    I wander from the jewels that I love.[934][935]                     270
    Must I not serve a long apprenticehood[934][935]
    To foreign passages, and in the end,[934][935]
    Having my freedom, boast of nothing else[934][935]
    But that I was a journeyman to grief?[934][935]

    _Gaunt._ All places that the eye of heaven visits[934]              275
    Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.[934][937]
    Teach thy necessity to reason thus;[934]
    There is no virtue like necessity.[934]
    Think not the king did banish thee,[934][938][939]
    But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,[934][938][940]         280
    Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.[934][938]
    Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour[934]
    And not the king exiled thee; or suppose[934]
    Devouring pestilence hangs in our air[934]
    And thou art flying to a fresher clime:[934]                        285
    Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it[934]
    To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:[934]
    Suppose the singing birds musicians,[934]
    The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,[934][941]
    The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more[934]                 290
    Than a delightful measure or a dance;[934]
    For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite[934][942]
    The man that mocks at it and sets it light.[934][942]

    _Boling._ O, who can hold a fire in his hand[943]
    By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?                                 295
    Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
    By bare imagination of a feast?
    Or wallow naked in December snow[944]
    By thinking on fastastic summer's heat?
    O, no! the apprehension of the good                                 300
    Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:[945]
    Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more[946]
    Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.[947]

    _Gaunt._ Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
    Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.                        305

    _Boling._ Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
    My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet![948]
    Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,
    Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.          [_Exeunt._[949]


SCENE IV. _The court._

   _Enter the_ KING, _with_ BAGOT _and_ GREEN _at one door; and the_
                   DUKE of AUMERLE _at another_.[950]

    _K. Rich._ We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,[951]
    How far brought you high Hereford on his way?

    _Aum._ I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
    But to the next highway, and there I left him.

    _K. Rich._ And say, what store of parting tears were shed?            5

    _Aum._ Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,[952]
    Which then blew bitterly against our faces,[953]
    Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance[954]
    Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

    _K. Rich._ What said our cousin when you parted with him?[955]       10

    _Aum._ 'Farewell:'[956]
    And, for my heart disdained that my tongue[956][957]
    Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
    To counterfeit oppression of such grief,
    That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.[958]                  15
    Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours[959]
    And added years to his short banishment,
    He should have had a volume of farewells;
    But since it would not, he had none of me.

    _K. Rich._ He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,[960]            20
    When time shall call him home from banishment,
    Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.[961][962]
    Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green[962]
    Observed his courtship to the common people;
    How he did seem to dive into their hearts                            25
    With humble and familiar courtesy,
    What reverence he did throw away on slaves.[963]
    Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles[964]
    And patient underbearing of his fortune,
    As 'twere to banish their affects with him.[965]                     30
    Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
    A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
    And had the tribute of his supple knee,
    With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
    As were our England in reversion his,                                35
    And he our subjects' next degree in hope.[966]

    _Green._ Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
    Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
    Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
    Ere further leisure yield them further means[967]                    40
    For their advantage and your highness' loss.

    _K. Rich._ We will ourself in person to this war:
    And, for our coffers, with too great a court
    And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
    We are inforced to farm our royal realm;                             45
    The revenue whereof shall furnish us[968]
    For our affairs in hand: if that come short,[968][969]
    Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
    Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
    They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold                     50
    And send them after to supply our wants;
    For we will make for Ireland presently.

                          _Enter_ BUSHY.[970]

    Bushy, what news?[970]

    _Bushy._ Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,[971]
    Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste                             55
    To entreat your majesty to visit him.

    _K. Rich._ Where lies he?[972]

    _Bushy._ At Ely House.[973]

    _K. Rich._ Now put it, God, in the physician's mind[974][975]
    To help him to his grave immediately!                                60
    The lining of his coffers shall make coats
    To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
    Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
    Pray God we may make haste, and come too late![974]

    _All._ Amen.                                        [_Exeunt._[976]  65

    My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.[978]

    As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,[984]
    Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound[985]
    The open ear of youth doth always listen;[986]                       20
    Report of fashions in proud Italy,[987]
    Whose manners still our tardy apish nation[988]
    Limps after in base imitation.[989]
    Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
    So it be new, there's no respect how vile--                          25
    That is not quickly buzz'd into his ears?[990]
    Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,[991]
    Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
    Direct not him whose way himself will choose:[992]
    'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.[992][993]  30

    _Gaunt._ Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
    And thus expiring do foretell of him:
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;[994]
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;                35
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,[995]
    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
    This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,[996]                40
    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,[996]
    This other Eden, demi-paradise;[996][997]
    This fortress built by Nature for herself[996]
    Against infection and the hand of war;[996][998]
    This happy breed of men, this little world,[996][999]                45
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,[996]
    Which serves it in the office of a wall,[996]
    Or as a moat defensive to a house,[996][1000]
    Against the envy of less happier lands;[996][1001]
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,[996][1002]  50
    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,[996]
    Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,[996][1003]
    Renowned for their deeds as far from home,[996][1004][1005]
    For Christian service and true chivalry,[996][1004][1006]
    As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry[996]                           55
    Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;
    This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
    Dear for her reputation through the world,
    Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
    Like to a tenement or pelting farm:[1007]                            60
    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege[1008]
    Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,[1009]
    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:[1010]
    That England, that was wont to conquer others,                       65
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,[1011]
    How happy then were my ensuing death!

        _Enter_ KING RICHARD _and_ QUEEN, AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN,
                  BAGOT, ROSS, _and_ WILLOUGHBY.[1012]

    _York._ The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;[1013]
    For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.[1014]              70

    _Queen._ How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?

    _K. Rich._ What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?

    _Gaunt._ O, how that name befits my composition![1015]
    Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:[1015]
    Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;[1015]                      75
    And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?[1015]
    For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;[1015]
    Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:[1015]
    The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,[1015]
    Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;[1015]                80
    And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:[1015][1016]
    Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,[1015]
    Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.[1015]

    _K. Rich._ Can sick men play so nicely with their names?[1015]

    _Gaunt._ No, misery makes sport to mock itself:[1015]                85
    Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,[1015]
    I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.[1015][1017]

    _K. Rich._ Should dying men flatter with those that live?[1015][1018]

    _Gaunt._ No, no, men living flatter those that die.[1015]

    _K. Rich._ Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.[1015][1019] 90

    _Gaunt._ O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.[1015]

    _K. Rich._ I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.[1015][1020]

    _Gaunt._ Now, He that made me knows I see thee ill;[1015]
    Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.[1021]
    Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land[1022]                       95
    Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
    And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
    Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure[1023]
    Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
    A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,                         100
    Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;[1024]
    And yet, incaged in so small a verge,[1025]
    The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.[1026]
    O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
    Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,                     105
    From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
    Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,
    Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.[1027]
    Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,[1028]
    It were a shame to let this land by lease;[1029]                    110
    But for thy world enjoying but this land,
    Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
    Landlord of England art thou now, not king:[1030]
    Thy state of law is bondslave to the law;[1031]
    And thou--

    _K. Rich._ A lunatic lean-witted fool,[1032]                        115
    Presuming on an ague's privilege,
    Barest with thy frozen admonition
    Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood[1033]
    With fury from his native residence.[1034]
    Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,                              120
    Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
    This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
    Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.[1035]

    _Gaunt._ O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,[1036]
    For that I was his father Edward's son;                             125
    That blood already, like the pelican,
    Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:[1037]
    My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
    Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
    May be a precedent and witness good                                 130
    That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:[1038]
    Join with the present sickness that I have;
    And thy unkindness be like crooked age,[1039][1040]
    To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.[1039]
    Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee![1041]               135
    These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
    Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
    Love they to live that love and honour have.

                             [_Exit, borne off by his Attendants._[1042]

    _K. Rich._ And let them die that age and sullens have;
    For both hast thou, and both become the grave.[1043]                140

    _York._ I do beseech your majesty, impute his words[1044][1045]
    To wayward sickliness and age in him:[1044]
    He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
    As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.

    _K. Rich._ Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;         145
    As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.[1046]

                     _Enter_ NORTHUMBERLAND.[1047]

    _North._ My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.

    _K. Rich._ What says he?

    _North._                 Nay, nothing; all is said:[1048]
    His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
    Words life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.                       150

    _York._ Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
    Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

    _K. Rich._ The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
    His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
    So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:                           155
    We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,[1049]
    Which live like venom where no venom else
    But only they have privilege to live.[1050]
    And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
    Towards our assistance we do seize to us                            160
    The plate, coin, revenues and moveables,[1051]
    Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.

    _York._ How long shall I be patient? ah, how long[1052]
    Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
    Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment,[1053]            165
    Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
    Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
    About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
    Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
    Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.                         170
    I am the last of noble Edward's sons,[1054]
    Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
    In war was never lion raged more fierce,[1055]
    In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
    Than was that young and princely gentleman.                         175
    His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
    Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;[1056]
    But when he frown'd, it was against the French
    And not against his friends; his noble hand
    Did win what he did spend and spent not that                        180
    Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
    His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,[1057]
    But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
    O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
    Or else he never would compare between.[1058]                       185

    _K. Rich._ Why, uncle, what's the matter?[1059]

    _York._                                    O my liege,[1059]
    Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased[1059][1060]
    Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.[1059][1060]
    Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
    The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?                      190
    Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
    Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
    Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
    Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
    Take Hereford's rights away, and take from time[1061]               195
    His charters and his customary rights;
    Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day:
    Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
    But by fair sequence and succession?
    Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--[1062]                      200
    If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,[1063]
    Call in the letters patents that he hath[1064]
    By his attorneys-general to sue
    His livery and deny his offer'd homage,
    You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,                          205
    You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts[1065]
    And prick my tender patience to those thoughts
    Which honour and allegiance cannot think.

    _K. Rich._ Think what you will, we seize into our hands[1066]
    His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.[1067]                210

    _York._ I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
    What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
    But by bad courses may be understood
    That their events can never fall out good.                  [_Exit._

    _K. Rich._ Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:            215
    Bid him repair to us to Ely House
    To see this business. To-morrow next[1068]
    We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
    And we create, in absence of ourself,
    Our uncle York lord governor of England;                            220
    For he is just and always loved us well.
    Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
    Be merry, for our time of stay is short.

             [_Flourish. Exeunt King, Queen, Aumerle, Bushy, Green, and
                                                          Bagot._[1069]

    _North._ Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.[1070]

    _Ross._ And living too; for now his son is duke.                    225

    _Willo._ Barely in title, not in revenue.[1071]

    _North._ Richly in both, if justice had her right.

    _Ross._ My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
    Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.

    _North._ Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more          230
    That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!

    _Willo._ Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?[1072]
    If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
    Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.

    _Ross._ No good at all that I can do for him;                       235
    Unless you call it good to pity him,
    Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.

    _North._ Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne[1073]
    In him a royal prince and many moe[1074]
    Of noble blood in this declining land.                              240
    The king is not himself, but basely led
    By flatterers; and what they will inform.
    Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,[1075]
    That will the king severely prosecute
    'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.[1075][1076]     245

    _Ross._ The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,[1077]
    And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined[1078]
    For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.[1079]

    _Willo._ And daily new exactions are devised,
    As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:[1080]                  250
    But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?[1081]

    _North._ Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,[1082][1083]
    But basely yielded upon compromise[1082]
    That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:[1082][1084]
    More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.[1082]                255

    _Ross._ The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

    _Willo._ The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.[1085]

    _North._ Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.[1086]

    _Ross._ He hath not money for these Irish wars,
    His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,                           260
    But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.

    _North._ His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
    But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
    Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;
    We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,[1087]                      265
    And yet we strike not, but securely perish.

    _Ross._ We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
    And unavoided is the danger now,[1088]
    For suffering so the causes of our wreck.

    _North._ Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death              270
    I spy life peering; but I dare not say[1089]
    How near the tidings of our comfort is.

    _Willo._ Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.

    _Ross._ Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
    We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,                         275
    Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.[1090]

    _North._ Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay[1091][1092]
    In Brittany, received intelligence[1092][1093]
    That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,[1094]
      ................................                                  280
    That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
    His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,[1095]
    Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,[1096]
    Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,[1097]
    All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne                    285
    With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war.
    Are making hither with all due expedience
    And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
    Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
    The first departing of the king for Ireland.                        290
    If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,[1098]
    Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
    Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,[1099]
    Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt[1100]
    And make high majesty look like itself,                             295
    Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;[1101]
    But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
    Stay and be secret, and myself will go.

    _Ross._ To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.

    _Willo._ Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.              300

                                                              [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _The palace._[1102]

                   _Enter_ QUEEN, BUSHY, _and_ BAGOT.

    _Bushy._ Madam, your majesty is too much sad.[1103]
    You promised, when you parted with the king,
    To lay aside life-harming heaviness,[1104]
    And entertain a cheerful disposition.

    _Queen._ To please the king I did; to please myself                   5
    I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
    Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
    Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
    As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
    Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,                          10
    Is coming towards me, and my inward soul[1105]
    With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,[1106]
    More than with parting from my lord the king.

    _Bushy._ Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,[1107]
    Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;[1108]                  15
    For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,[1109]
    Divides one thing entire to many objects;
    Like perspectives, which, rightly gazed upon,[1110]
    Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry,[1110]
    Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,[1111]                       20
    Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
    Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;[1112]
    Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows[1113]
    Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,[1114][1115]
    More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not
        seen;[1115][1116]                                                25
    Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,[1117]
    Which for things true weeps things imaginary.[1118]

    _Queen._ It may be so; but yet my inward soul
    Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,[1119]
    I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad,[1120]                             30
    As, though on thinking on no thought I think,[1121][1122]
    Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.[1121][1123]

    _Bushy._ 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.

    _Queen._ 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived[1124]
    From some forefather grief; mine is not so,                          35
    For nothing hath begot my something grief;[1125][1126]
    Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:[1125][1127]
    'Tis in reversion that I do possess;[1125][1128]
    But what it is, that is not yet known; what[1125][1129]
    I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.[1125][1129]                 40

                          _Enter_ GREEN.[1130]

    _Green._ God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:[1131]
    I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.

    _Queen._ Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
    For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:[1132]
    Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?                     45

    _Green._ That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
    And driven into despair an enemy's hope,[1133]
    Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
    The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
    And with uplifted arms is safe arrived[1134]                         50
    At Ravenspurgh.[1134][1135]

    _Queen._          Now God in heaven forbid!

    _Green._ Ah madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,[1136]
    The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,[1137]
    The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
    With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.                    55

    _Bushy._ Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
    And all the rest revolted faction traitors?[1138]

    _Green._ We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester[1139]
    Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,[1140]
    And all the household servants fled with him[1141]                   60
    To Bolingbroke.[1141][1142]

    _Queen._ So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,[1143]
    And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
    Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
    And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,[1144]                         65
    Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

    _Bushy._ Despair not, madam.

    _Queen._                     Who shall hinder me?
    I will despair, and be at enmity
    With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,[1145]
    A parasite, a keeper back of death,                                  70
    Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
    Which false hope lingers in extremity.

                          _Enter_ YORK.[1146]

    _Green._ Here comes the Duke of York.[1147]

    _Queen._ With signs of war about his aged neck;
    O, full of careful business are his looks![1148]                     75
    Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.[1149]

    _York._ Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:[1150]
    Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
    Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.[1151]
    Your husband, he is gone to save far off,                            80
    Whilst others come to make him lose at home:[1152]
    Here am I left to underprop his land,
    Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
    Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;[1153]
    Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.[1154]               85

                        _Enter a_ Servant.[1155]

    _Serv._ My lord, your son was gone before I came.[1156]

    _York._ He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
    The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,[1157]
    And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
    Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;[1158]           90
    Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:[1159]
    Hold, take my ring.[1160]

    _Serv._ My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,[1156][1161]
    To-day, as I came by, I called there;[1160][1162][1163]
    But I shall grieve you to report the rest.[1163]                     95

    _York._ What is't, knave?[1164]

    _Serv._ An hour before I came, the duchess died.[1156]

    _York._ God for his mercy! what a tide of woes[1165]
    Comes rushing on this woeful land at once![1166]
    I know not what to do: I would to God,[1165]                        100
    So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
    The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
    What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?[1167]
    How shall we do for money for these wars?
    Come, sister,--cousin, I would say,--pray, pardon me.               105
    Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts[1168]
    And bring away the armour that is there.      [_Exit Servant._[1169]
    Gentlemen, will you go muster men?[1170]
    If I know how or which way to order these affairs[1171]
    Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,[1172]                         110
    Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:[1173]
    The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath[1174]
    And duty bids defend; the other again[1175]
    Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,[1176]
    Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.                       115
    Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll[1177]
    Dispose of you.[1177]
    Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,[1177][1178]
    And meet me presently at Berkeley.[1179]
    I should to Plashy too;[1180]                                       120
    But time will not permit: all is uneven,[1180]
    And every thing is left at six and seven.[1180]

                                         [_Exeunt York and Queen._[1181]

    _Bushy._ The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,[1182]
    But none returns. For us to levy power
    Proportionable to the enemy[1183]                                   125
    Is all unpossible.[1183][1184]

    _Green._ Besides, our nearness to the king in love
    Is near the hate of those love not the king.

    _Bagot._ And that's the wavering commons: for their love[1185]
    Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them[1186]                  130
    By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.

    _Bushy._ Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.[1187]

    _Bagot._ If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
    Because we ever have been near the king.[1188]

    _Green._ Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol
        castle:[1189][1190]                                             135
    The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.

    _Bushy._ Thither will I with you; for little office[1191]
    The hateful commons will perform for us,[1192]
    Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.[1193]
    Will you go along with us?[1194]                                    140

    _Bagot._ No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.[1189][1195]
    Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
    We three here part that ne'er shall meet again.[1196]

    _Bushy._ That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.

    _Green._ Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes[1197]              145
    Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
    Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
    Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.[1198]

    _Bushy._ Well, we may meet again.[1198]

    _Bagot._                           I fear me, never.[1198]

                                                        [_Exeunt._[1199]


SCENE III. _Wilds in Gloucestershire._

     _Enter_ BOLINGBROKE _and_ NORTHUMBERLAND, _with Forces_.[1200]

    _Boling._ How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?

    _North._ Believe me, noble lord,[1201]
    I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:[1202]
    These high wild hills and rough uneven ways[1203]
    Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome;[1204]                  5
    And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,[1205]
    Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
    But I bethink me what a weary way
    From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found[1206]
    In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,[1207]                  10
    Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
    The tediousness and process of my travel:
    But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
    The present benefit which I possess;[1208]
    And hope to joy is little less in joy[1209]                          15
    Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
    Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done[1210]
    By sight of what I have, your noble company.[1211]

    _Boling._ Of much less value is my company
    Than your good words. But who comes here?[1212][1213]                20

                       _Enter_ HENRY PERCY.[1214]

    _North._ It is my son, young Harry Percy,[1214][1215]
    Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.[1216]
    Harry, how fares your uncle?[1217]

    _Percy._ I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of
        you.[1217][1218]

    _North._ Why, is he not with the queen?[1217][1219]                  25

    _Percy._ No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
    Broken his staff of office and dispersed
    The household of the king.

    _North._                     What was his reason?[1220]
    He was not so resolved when last we spake together.[1220][1221]

    _Percy._ Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.               30
    But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
    To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
    And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover[1222]
    What power the Duke of York had levied there;
    Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.[1223]                 35

    _North._ Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?[1224]

    _Percy._ No, my good Lord, for that is not forgot
    Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
    I never in my life did look on him.

    _North._ Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.               40

    _Percy._ My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
    Such as it is, being tender, raw and young;
    Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
    To more approved service and desert.

    _Boling._ I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure                    45
    I count myself in nothing else so happy
    As in a soul remembering my good friends;
    And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,[1225]
    It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
    My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.                 50

    _North._ How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
    Keeps good old York there with his men of war?

    _Percy._ There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,[1226]
    Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;[1227]
    And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;[1228]        55
    None else of name and noble estimate.

                  _Enter_ ROSS _and_ WILLOUGHBY.[1229]

    _North._ Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,[1230]
    Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.

    _Boling._ Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
    A banish'd traitor: all my treasury                                  60
    Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
    Shall be your love and labour's recompense.

    _Ross._ Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.

    _Willo._ And far surmounts our labour to attain it.

    _Boling._ Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;[1231]          65
    Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
    Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?[1232]

                           _Enter_ BERKELEY.

    _North._ It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.

    _Berk._ My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.[1233]

    _Boling._ My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;[1234]                 70
    And I am come to seek that name in England;[1235]
    And I must find that title in your tongue,[1236]
    Before I make reply to aught you say.

    _Berk._ Mistake me not, my Lord; 'tis not my meaning
    To raze one title of your honour out:[1237]                          75
    To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
    From the most gracious regent of this land,[1238]
    The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
    To take advantage of the absent time[1239]
    And fright our native peace with self-born arms.                     80

                     _Enter_ YORK _attended_.[1240]

    _Boling._ I shall not need transport my words by you;[1241]
    Here comes his grace in person.
                                    My noble uncle!     [_Kneels._[1242]

    _York._ Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
    Whose duty is deceiveable and false.

    _Boling._ My gracious uncle--                                        85

    _York._ Tut, tut![1243]
    Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:[1243][1244]
    I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace'[1245]
    In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
    Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs[1246]                     90
    Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?[1247]
    But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march[1248]
    So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
    Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
    And ostentation of despised arms?[1249]                              95
    Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
    Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
    And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
    Were I but now the lord of such hot youth[1250]
    As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself[1251]                   100
    Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
    From forth the ranks of many thousand French,[1252]
    O, then how quickly should this arm of mine,
    Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee[1253]
    And minister correction to thy fault!                               105

    _Boling._ My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
    On what condition stands it and wherein?[1254]

    _York._ Even in condition of the worst degree,
    In gross rebellion and detested treason:
    Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come                          110
    Before the expiration of thy time,
    In braving arms against thy sovereign.[1255]

    _Boling._ As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford:
    But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
    And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace                              115
    Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
    You are my father, for methinks in you[1256]
    I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,[1257]
    Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
    A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties                       120
    Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
    To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
    If that my cousin king be King of England,[1258]
    It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
    You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;[1259]                     125
    Had you first died, and he been thus trod down.
    He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
    To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.[1260]
    I am denied to sue my livery here,
    And yet my letters-patents give me leave:[1261]                     130
    My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold;
    And these and all are all amiss employ'd.[1262]
    What would you have me do? I am a subject,
    And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;[1263]
    And therefore personally I lay my claim                             135
    To my inheritance of free descent.[1264]

    _North._ The noble duke hath been too much abused.

    _Ross._ It stands your grace upon to do him right.

    _Willo._ Base men by his endowments are made great.

    _York._ My lords of England, let me tell you this:                  140
    I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
    And laboured all I could to do him right;
    But in this kind to come, in braving arms,[1265]
    Be his own carver and cut out his way,
    To find out right with wrong, it may not be;[1266]                  145
    And you that do abet him in this kind
    Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

    _North._ The noble duke hath sworn his coming is[1267]
    But for his own; and for the right of that
    We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;                         150
    And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath![1268]

    _York._ Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
    I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
    Because my power is weak and all ill left:
    But if I could, by Him that gave me life,                           155
    I would attach you all and make you stoop
    Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
    But since I cannot, be it known to you
    I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;[1269]
    Unless you please to enter in the castle                            160
    And there repose you for this night.[1270]

    _Boling._ An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
    But we must win your grace to go with us
    To Bristol castle, which they say is held[1271]
    By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,[1272]                          165
    The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
    Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

    _York._ It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;[1273]
    For I am loath to break our country's laws.
    Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:[1274]                  170
    Things past redress are now with me past care.      [_Exeunt._[1275]


SCENE IV. _A camp in Wales._

             _Enter_ SALISBURY _and a_ Welsh Captain.[1276]

    _Cap._ My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,[1277]
    And hardly kept our countrymen together,[1278]
    And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
    Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.[1279]

    _Sal._ Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:                    5
    The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.[1280]

    _Cap._ 'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
    The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd[1281]
    And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;[1282]
    The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth                        10
    And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
    Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,[1283]
    The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
    The other to enjoy by rage and war:[1284]
    These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.[1285]                15
    Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
    As well assured Richard their king is dead.           [_Exit._[1286]

    _Sal._ Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind[1287][1288]
    I see thy glory like a shooting star[1288]
    Fall to the base earth from the firmament.                           20
    Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,[1289]
    Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
    Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
    And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.             [_Exit._[1286]

SCENE I. _Bristol. Before the Castle._

        _Enter_ BOLINGBROKE, YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, ROSS, PERCY,
        WILLOUGHBY, _with_ BUSHY _and_ GREEN, _prisoners_.[1290]

    _Boling._ Bring forth these men.
    Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
    Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
    With too much urging your pernicious lives,[1291]
    For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood                        5
    From off my hands, here in the view of men
    I will unfold some causes of your deaths.[1292]
    You have misled a prince, a royal king,
    A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
    By you unhappied and disfigured clean:                               10
    You have in manner with your sinful hours
    Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
    Broke the possession of a royal bed[1293]
    And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
    With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.[1294]            15
    Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
    Near to the king in blood, and near in love
    Till you did make him misinterpret me,[1295]
    Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
    And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,[1296]                20
    Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
    Whilst you have fed upon my signories,[1297]
    Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
    From my own windows torn my household coat,[1298]
    Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,[1299]                      25
    Save men's opinions and my living blood,
    To show the world I am a gentleman.
    This and much more, much more than twice all this,
    Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over[1300]
    To execution and the hand of death.                                  30

    _Bushy._ More welcome is the stroke of death to me
    Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.[1301]

    _Green._ My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
    And plague injustice with the pains of hell.

    _Boling._ My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.               35

          [_Exeunt Northumberland and others, with the prisoners._[1302]

    Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
    For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:[1303]
    Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
    Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.[1304]

    _York._ A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd                        40
    With letters of your love to her at large.

    _Boling._ Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,[1305]
    To fight with Glendower and his complices:[1306]
    Awhile to work, and after holiday.                        [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _The coast of Wales. A castle in view._

    _Drums: flourish and colours. Enter_ KING RICHARD, _the_ BISHOP
              of CARLISLE, AUMERLE, _and Soldiers_.[1307]

    _K. Rich._ Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?[1308]

    _Aum._ Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,[1309]
    After your late tossing on the breaking seas?[1310]

    _K. Rich._ Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
    To stand upon my kingdom once again.                                  5
    Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
    Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
    As a long-parted mother with her child[1311]
    Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,[1312]
    So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,[1313]                  10
    And do thee favours with my royal hands.[1314]
    Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
    Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
    But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
    And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,                             15
    Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
    Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
    Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
    And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower.[1315]
    Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder[1316]                    20
    Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
    Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
    Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
    This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
    Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king                            25
    Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.[1317]

    _Car._ Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
    Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
    The means that heaven yields must be embraced,[1318][1319]
    And not neglected; else, if heaven would,[1318][1320]                30
    And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,[1318][1321]
    The proffer'd means of succour and redress.[1318][1322]

    _Aum._ He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
    Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,[1323]
    Grows strong and great in substance and in power.[1324]              35

    _K. Rich._ Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not[1325]
    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,[1326]
    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,[1326][1327]
    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    In murders and in outrage, boldly here;[1328]                        40
    But when from under this terrestrial ball[1329]
    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    And darts his light through every guilty hole,[1330]
    Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,               45
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
    Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,[1331]
    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,                         50
    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,[1332]
    Not able to endure the sight of day,
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.[1333]
    Not all the water in the rough rude sea[1334]
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;[1335]                   55
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose[1336]
    The deputy elected by the Lord:
    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd[1337]
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,[1338]
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay[1339]                       60
    A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
    Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.

                           _Enter_ SALISBURY.

    Welcome, my lord: how far off lies your power?[1340]

    _Sal._ Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
    Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue                      65
    And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
    One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,[1341]
    Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:[1342]
    O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
    And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men![1343]              70
    To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
    O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:[1344]
    For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,
    Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.[1345]

    _Aum._ Comfort, my liege: why looks your grace so pale?              75

    _K. Rich._ But now the blood of twenty thousand men[1346]
    Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
    And, till so much blood thither come again,[1347]
    Have I not reason to look pale and dead?[1347]
    All souls that will be safe fly from my side,                        80
    For time hath set a blot upon my pride.

    _Aum._ Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.

    _K. Rich._ I had forgot myself: am I not king?
    Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.[1348]
    Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?[1349]                  85
    Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
    At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
    Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
    High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
    Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?[1350]       90

                            _Enter_ SCROOP.

    _Scroop._ More health and happiness betide my liege[1351]
    Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!

    _K. Rich._ Mine ear is open and my heart prepared:
    The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
    Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care;                         95
    And what loss is it to be rid of care?
    Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
    Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
    We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
    Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;                           100
    They break their faith to God as well as us:
    Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay;[1352]
    The worst is death, and death will have his day.

    _Scroop._ Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
    To bear the tidings of calamity.                                    105
    Like an unseasonable stormy day,
    Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,[1353]
    As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
    So high above his limits swells the rage[1354]
    Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land                          110
    With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.[1355]
    White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps[1356]
    Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,[1357]
    Strive to speak big and clap their female joints[1358]
    In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:[1359]                     115
    Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows[1360]
    Of double-fatal yew against thy state;[1361]
    Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills[1362]
    Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,[1362]
    And all goes worse than I have power to tell.                       120

    _K. Rich._ Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
    Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?[1363]
    What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
    That they have let the dangerous enemy
    Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?                      125
    If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:[1364]
    I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.[1365]

    _Scroop._ Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.[1366]

    _K. Rich._ O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
    Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man![1367]                          130
    Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
    Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
    Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
    Upon their spotted souls for this offence![1368]

    _Scroop._ Sweet love, I see, changing his property,[1369]           135
    Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
    Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
    With heads, and not with hands: those whom you curse[1370]
    Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound[1371]
    And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.[1372]                140

    _Aum._ Is Bushy, Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?

    _Scroop._ Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.[1373]

    _Aum._ Where is the duke my father with his power?

    _K. Rich._ No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
    Let's talk of graves, of worms and epitaphs;                        145
    Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
    Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.[1374]
    Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
    And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
    Save our deposed bodies to the ground?                              150
    Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
    And nothing can we call our own but death
    And that small model of the barren earth[1375]
    Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
    For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground[1376]                    155
    And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
    How some have been deposed; some slain in war;
    Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;[1377]
    Some poison'd by their wives; some sleeping kill'd;
    All murder'd: for within the hollow crown                           160
    That rounds the mortal temples of a king
    Keeps Death his court and there the antique sits,
    Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
    Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
    To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,                       165
    Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
    As if this flesh which walls about our life
    Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
    Comes at the last and with a little pin[1378]
    Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king![1379]             170
    Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood[1380]
    With solemn reverence: throw away respect,[1380]
    Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,[1381]
    For you have but mistook me all this while:
    I live with bread like you, feel want,[1382]                        175
    Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,[1382][1383][1384]
    How can you say to me, I am a king?[1382][1384][1385]

    _Car._ My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,[1386]
    But presently prevent the ways to wail.
    To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,                    180
    Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
    And so your follies fight against yourself.[1387]
    Fear, and be slain; no worse can come to fight:[1388][1389]
    And fight and die is death destroying death;[1388][1390]
    Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.[1388]                185

    _Aum._ My father hath a power; inquire of him,[1388]
    And learn to make a body of a limb.[1388]

    _K. Rich._ Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
    To change blows with thee for our day of doom.[1391]
    This ague fit of fear is over-blown;[1391]                          190
    An easy task it is to win our own.[1391]
    Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
    Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.[1392]

    _Scroop._ Men judge by the complexion of the sky[1392]
      The state and inclination of the day:[1392]                       195
    So may you by my dull and heavy eye,[1392]
      My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.[1392]
    I play the torturer, by small and small
    To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
    Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,[1393]                   200
    And all your northern castles yielded up
    And all your southern gentlemen in arms
    Upon his party.

    _K. Rich._   Thou hast said enough.[1394]
    Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth [_To Aumerle._[1395]
    Of that sweet way I was in to despair!                              205
    What say you now? what comfort have we now?
    By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
    That bids me be of comfort any more.
    Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
    A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.                         210
    That power I have, discharge; and let them go[1396]
    To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,[1397]
    For I have none: let no man speak again
    To alter this, for counsel is but vain.

    _Aum._ My liege, one word.

    _K. Rich._                  He does me double wrong                 215
    That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
    Discharge my followers: let them hence away,[1398]
    From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.[1399]      [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _Wales. Before Flint castle._

           _Enter, with drum and colours_, BOLINGBROKE, YORK,
            NORTHUMBERLAND, Attendants, _and forces_.[1400]

    _Boling._ So that by this intelligence we learn
    The Welshmen are dispersed; and Salisbury
    Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
    With some few private friends upon this coast.

    _North._ The news is very fair and good, my lord:                     5
    Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.

    _York._ It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
    To say 'King Richard': alack the heavy day[1401]
    When such a sacred king should hide his head.

    _North._ Your grace mistakes; only to be brief,[1402]                10
    Left I his title out.[1403]

    _York._                 The time hath been,[1404]
    Would you have been so brief with him, he would[1404][1405]
    Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,[1406][1407]
    For taking so the head, your whole head's length.[1406][1408]

    _Boling._ Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.[1409]         15

    _York._ Take not, good cousin, further than you should,[1409]
    Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.[1410]

    _Boling._ I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself[1411]
    Against their will. But who comes here?[1412]

                             _Enter_ PERCY.

    Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?[1413]              20

    _Percy._ The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,[1414]
    Against thy entrance.[1415]

    _Boling._ Royally![1416]
    Why, it contains no king?[1416]

    _Percy._                    Yes, my good lord,
    It doth contain a king; King Richard lies[1417]                      25
    Within the limits of yon lime and stone:[1418]
    And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,[1419]
    Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
    Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.

    _North._ O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.[1420][1421]         30

    _Boling._ Noble lords,[1421][1422]
    Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley[1423]
    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:[1424]
    Henry Bolingbroke[1424][1425][1426]                                  35
    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand[1426][1427]
    And sends allegiance and true faith of heart[1428]
    To his most royal person; hither come[1429]
    Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,[1430]
    Provided that my banishment repeal'd                                 40
    And lands restored again be freely granted:
    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:[1431]
    The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke[1432]            45
    It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench[1433]
    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
    Go, signify as much, while here we march
    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.                                50
    Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,[1434]
    That from this castle's tatter'd battlements[1435]
    Our fair appointments may be well perused.
    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
    With no less terror than the elements                                55
    Of fire and water, when their thundering shock[1436]
    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:[1437]
    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain[1437][1438]
    My waters; on the earth, and not on him.[1437][1439]                 60
    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.

    _Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish. Enter on the
        walls_, KING RICHARD, _the_ BISHOP of CARLISLE, AUMERLE,
        SCROOP, _and_ SALISBURY.[1440]

    See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,[1441]
    As doth the blushing discontented sun
    From out the fiery portal of the east,
    When he perceives the envious clouds are bent                        65
    To dim his glory and to stain the track[1442]
    Of his bright passage to the occident.

    _York._ Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
    As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
    Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,[1443]                    70
    That any harm should stain so fair a show![1444]

    _K. Rich._ We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
    To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,         [_To North._[1445]
    Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:[1446]
    And if we be, how dare thy joints forget[1447]                       75
    To pay their awful duty to our presence?[1448]
    If we be not, show us the hand of God
    That hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship;
    For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
    Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,                          80
    Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
    And though you think that all, as you have done,
    Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
    And we are barren and bereft of friends;
    Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,[1449]                           85
    Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
    Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
    Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
    That lift your vassal hands against my head
    And threat the glory of my precious crown.                           90
    Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--[1450]
    That every stride he makes upon my land[1451]
    Is dangerous treason: he is come to open[1452]
    The purple testament of bleeding war;
    But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,[1453]                  95
    Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
    Shall ill become the flower of England's face,[1454][1455]
    Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace[1455][1456]
    To scarlet indignation and bedew
    Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.[1457]              100

    _North._ The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
    Should so with civil and uncivil arms
    Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin[1458]
    Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;[1459]
    And by the honourable tomb he swears,                               105
    That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
    And by the royalties of both your bloods,
    Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
    And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,[1460]
    And by the worth and honour of himself,                             110
    Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
    His coming hither hath no further scope
    Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
    Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
    Which on thy royal party granted once,                              115
    His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
    His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
    To faithful service of your majesty.
    This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;[1461]
    And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.[1462]                       120

    _K. Rich._ Northumberland, say thus the king returns:[1463]
    His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
    And all the number of his fair demands
    Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:[1464]
    With all the gracious utterance thou hast[1464][1465]               125
    Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.[1466]
    We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,      [_To Aumerle._[1467]
    To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
    Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
    Defiance to the traitor, and so die?                                130

    _Aum._ No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words[1468]
    Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.[1469]

    _K. Rich._ O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
    That laid the sentence of dread banishment
    On yon proud man, should take it off again[1470]                    135
    With words of sooth! O that I were as great
    As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
    Or that I could forget what I have been,
    Or not remember what I must be now!
    Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,           140
    Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.

    _Aum._ Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.

    _K. Rich._ What must the king do now? must he submit?
    The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
    The king shall be contented: must he lose                           145
    The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:[1471]
    I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
    My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
    My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,[1472]
    My figured goblets for a dish of wood,                              150
    My sceptre for a palmer's walking-staff,
    My subjects for a pair of carved saints
    And my large kingdom for a little grave,
    A little little grave, an obscure grave;
    Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,                            155
    Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet[1473]
    May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
    For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;[1474]
    And buried once, why not upon my head?[1474]
    Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin![1475]              160
    We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
    Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
    And make a dearth in this revolting land.
    Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
    And make some pretty match with shedding tears?[1476]               165
    As thus, to drop them still upon one place,[1477]
    Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
    Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies[1478][1479]
    Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.[1478]
    Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see[1478]                 170
    I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.[1478][1480]
    Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
    What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
    Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
    You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.                            175

    _North._ My lord, in the base court he doth attend
    To speak with you; may it please you to come down.[1481]

    _K. Rich._ Down, down I come; like glistering Phaeton,
    Wanting the manage of unruly jades.[1482]
    In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,[1483][1484]   180
    To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.[1483]
    In the base court? Come down? Down, court! down, king![1483][1485]
    For night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.[1483]

                                             [_Exeunt from above._[1486]

    _Boling._ What says his majesty?

    _North._                         Sorrow and grief of heart[1487]
    Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man:                         185
    Yet he is come.[1488]

      _Enter_ KING RICHARD _and his attendants below_.[1488][1489]

    _Boling._ Stand all apart,[1488]
    And show fair duty to his majesty.[1488]      [_He kneels down._[1490]
    My gracious lord,--[1488]

    _K. Rich._ Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee[1491]         190
    To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
    Me rather had my heart might feel your love
    Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
    Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,[1492][1493]
    Thus high at least, although your knee be low.[1492][1494]          195

    _Boling._ My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.

    _K. Rich._ Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.

    _Boling._ So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
    As my true service shall deserve your love.

    _K. Rich._ Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,[1495]       200
    That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
    Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;[1496]
    Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
    Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
    Though you are old enough to be my heir.[1497]                      205
    What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
    For do we must what force will have us do.
    Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?[1498]

    _Boling._ Yea, my good lord.

    _K. Rich._                   Then I must not say no.

                                              [_Flourish. Exeunt._[1499]


SCENE IV. _Langley. The_ DUKE of YORK'S _garden_.

               _Enter the_ QUEEN _and two_ Ladies.[1500]

    _Queen._ What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
    To drive away the heavy thought of care?

    _Lady._ Madam, we'll play at bowls.[1501]

    _Queen._ 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
    And that my fortune runs against the bias.                            5

    _Lady._ Madam, we'll dance.

    _Queen._ My legs can keep no measure in delight,
    When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
    Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.

    _Lady._ Madam, we'll tell tales.[1502]                               10

    _Queen._ Of sorrow or of joy?[1502][1503]

    _Lady._                       Of either, madam.

    _Queen._ Of neither, girl:[1504]
    For if of joy, being altogether wanting,
    It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
    Or if of grief, being altogether had,[1505]                          15
    It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
    For what I have I need not to repeat;
    And what I want it boots not to complain.[1506]

    _Lady._ Madam, I'll sing.

    _Queen._                  'Tis well that thou hast cause;
    But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.               20

    _Lady._ I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

    _Queen._ And I could sing, would weeping do me good,[1507][1508]
    And never borrow any tear of thee.[1507][1509]

                _Enter a_ Gardener, _and two_ Servants.

    But stay, here come the gardeners:[1510]
    Let's step into the shadow of these trees.                           25
    My wretchedness unto a row of pins,[1511]
    They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
    Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.

                                       [_Queen and Ladies retire._[1512]

    _Gard._ Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,[1513]
    Which, like unruly children, make their sire                         30
    Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
    Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
    Go thou, and like an executioner,
    Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,[1514]
    That look too lofty in our commonwealth:                             35
    All must be even in our government.
    You thus employ'd, I will go root away
    The noisome weeds, which without profit suck[1515]
    The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.

    _Serv._ Why should we in the compass of a pale[1516]                 40
    Keep law and form and due proportion,
    Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,[1517]
    When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
    Is full of weeds; her fairest flowers choked up,
    Her fruit-trees all unpruned, her hedges ruin'd,                     45
    Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs[1518]
    Swarming with caterpillars?

    _Gard._                     Hold thy peace:
    He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring[1518][1519]
    Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
    The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,[1520]        50
    That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
    Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,[1521]
    I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

    _Serv._ What, are they dead?

    _Gard._                      They are; and Bolingbroke[1522]
    Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it[1522][1523]        55
    That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land[1522][1524]
    As we this garden! We at time of year[1522][1525]
    Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,[1525]
    Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
    With too much riches it confound itself:                             60
    Had he done so to great and growing men,
    They might have lived to bear and he to taste
    Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches[1526]
    We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:[1527]
    Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,                         65
    Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.[1528]

    _Serv._ What, think you then the king shall be deposed?[1529]

    _Gard._ Depress'd he is already, and deposed
    'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night[1530][1531]
    To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,[1530][1532]             70
    That tell black tidings.[1533]

    _Queen._ O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking![1533][1534]

                                                      [_Coming forward._

    Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,[1533][1535]
    How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?[1533][1536]
    What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee                          75
    To make a second fall of cursed man?
    Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
    Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
    Divine his downfal? Say, where, when, and how,
    Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.[1537]           80

    _Gard._ Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
    To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.[1538]
    King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
    Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
    In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,[1539]                   85
    And some few vanities that make him light;
    But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
    Besides himself, are all the English peers,
    And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
    Post you to London, and you will find it so;[1540]                   90
    I speak no more than every one doth know.

    _Queen._ Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
    Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
    And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st[1541]
    To serve me last, that I may longest keep                            95
    Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,[1542]
    To meet at London London's king in woe.
    What, was I born to this, that my sad look
    Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
    Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,[1543]                   100
    Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

                                       [_Exeunt Queen and Ladies._[1544]

    _Gard._ Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
    I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
    Here did she fall a tear; here in this place[1545]
    I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:[1546]                   105
    Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
    In the remembrance of a weeping queen.              [_Exeunt._[1547]

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _Westminster Hall._

    _Enter as to the Parliament_, BOLINGBROKE, AUMERLE,
        NORTHUMBERLAND, PERCY, FITZWATER, SURREY, _the_ BISHOP of
        CARLISLE, _the_ ABBOT of WESTMINSTER, _and another_ Lord,
        Herald, Officers, _and_ BAGOT.[1548]

    _Boling._ Call forth Bagot.[1549]
    Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;[1550]
    What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death;
    Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
    The bloody office of his timeless end.                                5

    _Bagot._ Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.

    _Boling._ Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.

    _Bagot._ My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
    Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.[1551]
    In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,               10
    I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
    That reacheth from the restful English court
    As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'[1552]
    Amongst much other talk, that very time,
    I heard you say that you had rather refuse[1553]                     15
    The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
    Than Bolingbroke's return to England;[1554][1555]
    Adding withal, how blest this land would be[1555][1556]
    In this your cousin's death.[1555]

    _Aum._                       Princes and noble lords,[1557]
    What answer shall I make to this base man?                           20
    Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,[1558]
    On equal terms to give him chastisement?[1559]
    Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd[1560]
    With the attainder of his slanderous lips.[1561]
    There is my gage, the manual seal of death,                          25
    That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,[1562]
    And will maintain what thou hast said is false[1563]
    In thy heart-blood, though being all too base[1564]
    To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

    _Boling._ Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.                 30

    _Aum._ Excepting one, I would he were the best
    In all this presence that hath moved me so.

    _Fitz._ If that thy valour stand on sympathy,[1565]
    There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
    By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,[1566]           35
    I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it,
    That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
    If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;[1567]
    And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
    Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.                         40

    _Aum._ Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.[1568]

    _Fitz._ Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.

    _Aum._ Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.[1569]

    _Percy._ Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
    In this appeal as thou art all unjust;                               45
    And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
    To prove it on thee to the extremest point
    Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.

    _Aum._ An if I do not, may my hands rot off[1570]
    And never brandish more revengeful steel                             50
    Over the glittering helmet of my foe!

    _Another Lord._ I task the earth to the like, forsworn
        Aumerle;[1571][1572]
    And spur thee on with full as many lies[1571]
    As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear[1571][1573]
    From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;[1571][1574]              55
    Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.[1571]

    _Aum._ Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:[1571]
    I have a thousand spirits in one breast,[1571]
    To answer twenty thousand such as you.[1571]

    _Surrey._ My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well[1575][1576]          60
    The very time Aumerle and you did talk.[1575][1577]

    _Fitz._ 'Tis very true: you were in presence then;[1578]
    And you can witness with me this is true.

    _Surrey._ As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.[1579]

    _Fitz._ Surrey, thou liest.[1580]

    _Surrey._                    Dishonourable boy![1581]                65
    That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,[1581]
    That it shall render vengeance and revenge
    Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie[1582]
    In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
    In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;[1583]                   70
    Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

    _Fitz._ How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
    If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,[1584]
    I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
    And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,                             75
    And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,[1585]
    To tie thee to my strong correction.
    As I intend to thrive in this new world,[1586]
    Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
    Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say,[1587]                     80
    That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
    To execute the noble duke at Calais.

    _Aum._ Some honest Christian trust me with a gage,
    That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
    If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.[1588]                      85

    _Boling._ These differences shall all rest under gage
    Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
    And, though mine enemy, restored again
    To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,[1589]
    Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.                           90

    _Car._ That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.[1590]
    Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
    For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,[1591]
    Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
    Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens;                           95
    And toil'd with works of war, retired himself[1592]
    To Italy; and there at Venice gave
    His body to that pleasant country's earth,[1593]
    And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
    Under whose colours he had fought so long.                          100

    _Boling._ Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?[1594]

    _Car._ As surely as I live, my lord.[1595]

    _Boling._ Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom[1596][1597]
    Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,[1597][1598]
    Your differences shall all rest under gage[1597]                    105
    Till we assign you to your days of trial.

                    _Enter_ YORK, _attended_.[1599]

    _York._ Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee[1600]
    From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
    Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields[1601]
    To the possession of thy royal hand:                                110
    Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
    And long live Henry, fourth of that name![1602]

    _Boling._ In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.

    _Car._ Marry, God forbid![1603][1604]
    Worst in this royal presence may I speak,[1605]                     115
    Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.[1606]
    Would God that any in this noble presence[1607]
    Were enough noble to be upright judge
    Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would[1608]
    Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.                         120
    What subject can give sentence on his king?
    And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?[1609]
    Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
    Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
    And shall the figure of God's majesty,                              125
    His captain, steward, deputy, elect,[1610]
    Anointed, crowned, planted many years,[1611]
    Be judged by subject and inferior breath,[1612]
    And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,[1613]
    That in a Christian climate souls refined                           130
    Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
    I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
    Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king.[1604]
    My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
    Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:                         135
    And if you crown him, let me prophesy;
    The blood of English shall manure the ground,
    And future ages groan for this foul act;[1614]
    Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
    And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars                           140
    Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
    Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
    Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
    The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
    O, if you raise this house against this house,[1615]                145
    It will the woefullest division prove
    That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
    Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,[1616]
    Lest child, child's children, cry against you 'woe!'[1617]

    _North._ Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,            150
    Of capital treason we arrest you here.
    My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
    To keep him safely till his day of trial.
    May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.[1618][1619]

    _Boling._ Fetch hither Richard, that in common view[1618][1620]     155
    He may surrender; so we shall proceed[1618][1620]
    Without suspicion.[1618][1620]

    _York._              I will be his conduct.[1618][1621]      [_Exit._

    _Boling._ Lords, you that here are under our arrest,[1618][1622]
    Procure your sureties for your days of answer.[1618]
    Little are we beholding to your love,[1618][1623]                   160
    And little look'd for at your helping hands.[1618][1624]

     _Re-enter_ YORK, _with_ RICHARD, _and_ Officers _bearing the
                         regalia_.[1618][1625]

    _K. Rich._ Alack, why am I sent for to a king,[1618][1626]
    Before I have shook off the regal thoughts[1618]
    Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd[1618]
    To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:[1618][1627]          165
    Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me[1618][1628][1629]
    To this submission. Yet I well remember[1618][1628][1630]
    The favours of these men: were they not mine?[1618][1628]
    Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?[1618][1628][1631]
    So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,[1618][1628]              170
    Found truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand, none.[1618]
    God save the king! Will no man say amen?[1618][1632]
    Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.[1618][1632]
    God save the king! although I be not he;[1618][1632]
    And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.[1618][1632]               175
    To do what service am I sent for hither?[1618]

    _York._ To do that office of thine own good will[1618]
    Which tired majesty did make thee offer,[1618]
    The resignation of thy state and crown[1618]
    To Henry Bolingbroke.[1618][1633]                                   180

    _K. Rich._ Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the
        crown;[1618][1634]
    Here cousin;[1618][1635][1636]
    On this side my hand, and on that side yours.[1618][1635][1637]
    Now is this golden crown like a deep well[1618][1638]
    That owes two buckets, filling one another,[1618][1638]             185
    The emptier ever dancing in the air,[1618][1638]
    The other down, unseen and full of water:[1618][1638]
    That bucket down and full of tears am I,[1618][1638]
    Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.[1618][1638][1639]

    _Boling._ I thought you had been willing to resign.[1618][1638]     190

    _K. Rich._ My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:[1618][1638]
    You may my glories and my state depose,[1618][1638]
    But not my griefs; still am I king of those.[1618][1638]

    _Boling._ Part of your cares you give me with your crown.[1618][1638]

    _K. Rich._ Your cares set up do not pluck my cares
        down.[1618][1638]                                               195
    My care is loss of care, by old care done;[1618][1638]
    Your care is gain of care, by new care won:[1618][1638]
    The cares I give, I have, though given away;[1618][1638]
    They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.[1618][1638][1640]

    _Boling._ Are you contented to resign the crown?[1618][1638]        200

    _K. Rich._ Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;[1618][1638][1641]
    Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.[1618][1638][1642]
    Now mark me, how I will undo myself:[1618]
    I give this heavy weight from off my head[1618]
    And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,[1618]                       205
    The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;[1618]
    With mine own tears I wash away my balm,[1618][1643]
    With mine own hands I give away my crown,[1618]
    With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,[1618]
    With mine own breath release all duty's rites:[1618][1644]          210
    All pomp and majesty I do forswear;[1618]
    My manors, rents, revenues I forego;[1618][1645]
    My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:[1618]
    God pardon all oaths that are broke to me![1618]
    God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee![1618][1646]           215
    Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,[1618]
    And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved![1618]
    Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,[1618][1647]
    And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit![1618][1647][1648]
    God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,[1618][1647][1649]       220
    And send him many years of sunshine days![1618][1647][1650]
    What more remains?[1618]

    _North._             No more, but that you read[1618][1651]
    These accusations and these grievous crimes[1618]
    Committed by your person and your followers[1618]
    Against the state and profit of this land;[1618]                    225
    That, by confessing them, the souls of men[1618]
    May deem that you are worthily deposed.[1618]

    _K. Rich._ Must I do so? and must I ravel out[1618]
    My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,[1618][1652]
    If thy offences were upon record,[1618]                             230
    Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop[1618]
    To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,[1618][1653]
    There shouldst thou find one heinous article,[1618]
    Containing the deposing of a king[1618]
    And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,[1618]                   235
    Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:[1618]
    Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,[1618][1654]
    Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,[1618][1655]
    Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands[1618]
    Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates[1618][1656]                240
    Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,[1618][1657]
    And water cannot wash away your sin.[1618]

    _North._ My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.[1618]

    _K. Rich._ Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:[1618]
    And yet salt water blinds them not so much[1618]                    245
    But they can see a sort of traitors here.[1618]
    Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,[1618]
    I find myself a traitor with the rest;[1618]
    For I have given here my soul's consent[1618]
    To undeck the pompous body of a king;[1618][1658]                   250
    Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,[1618][1659]
    Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.[1618]

    _North._ My lord,--[1618]

    _K. Rich._ No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,[1618][1660]
    Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,[1618][1661]            255
    No, not that name was given me at the font,[1618]
    But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,[1618]
    That I have worn so many winters out,[1618]
    And know not now what name to call myself![1618]
    O that I were a mockery king of snow,[1618][1662]                   260
    Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,[1618]
    To melt myself away in water-drops![1618]
    Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,[1618][1663]
    An if my word be sterling yet in England,[1618][1664]
    Let it command a mirror hither straight,[1618][1665]                265
    That it may show me what a face I have,[1618]
    Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.[1618][1666]

    _Boling._ Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.[1618]

                                       [_Exit an attendant._[1618][1667]

    _North._ Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.[1618]

    _K. Rich._ Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to
        hell![1618][1668]                                               270

    _Boling._ Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.[1618]

    _North._ The commons will not then be satisfied.[1618]

    _K. Rich._ They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,[1618]
    When I do see the very book indeed[1618]
    Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.[1618]                275

           _Re-enter_ Attendant, _with a glass_.[1618][1669]

    Give me the glass, and therein will I read.[1618][1670][1671]
    No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck[1618][1670]
    So many blows upon this face of mine,[1618][1670]
    And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,[1618][1670]
    Like to my followers in prosperity,[1618][1670]                     280
    Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face[1618][1672][1673][1674]
    That every day under his household roof[1618][1673]
    Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face[1618][1673][1675][1676]
    That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?[1618][1673][1676]
    Was this the face that faced so many
        follies,[1618][1673][1677][1678]                                285
    And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?[1618][1678][1679]
    A brittle glory shineth in this face:[1618][1678]
    As brittle as the glory is the face;[1618][1678]

               [_Dashes the glass against the ground._[1618][1678][1680]

    For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.[1618][1678][1681]
    Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,[1618][1678][1682]       290
    How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.[1618]

    _Boling._ The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd[1618]
    The shadow of your face.[1618]

    _K. Rich._               Say that again.[1618][1683]
    The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:[1618][1683]
    'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;[1618][1683]               295
    And these external manners of laments[1618][1683][1684]
    Are merely shadows to the unseen grief,[1618][1683]
    That swells with silence in the tortured soul;[1618][1683]
    There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,[1618][1685]
    For thy great bounty, that not only givest[1618][1686]              300
    Me cause to wail but teachest me the way[1618]
    How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,[1618]
    And then be gone and trouble you no more.[1618]
    Shall I obtain it?[1618]

    _Boling._ Name it, fair cousin.[1618][1687]

    _K. Rich._ 'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:[1618][1688]     305
    For when I was a king, my flatterers[1618][1689]
    Were then but subjects; being now a subject,[1618][1689]
    I have a king here to my flatterer.[1618][1689]
    Being so great, I have no need to beg.[1618][1689]

    _Boling._ Yet ask.[1618]                                            310

    _K. Rich._ And shall I have?[1618][1690]

    _Boling._ You shall.[1618][1691]

    _K. Rich._ Then give me leave to go.[1618][1692]

    _Boling._ Whither?[1618]

    _K. Rich._ Whither you will, so I were from your
        sights.[1618][1693]                                             315

    _Boling._ Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.[1618]

    _K. Rich._ O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,[1618][1694][1695]
    That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.[1694][1696]

                        [_Exeunt King Richard, some Lords, and a Guard._

    _Boling._ On Wednesday next we solemnly set down[1697]
    Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.[1697]                    320

                        [_Exeunt all except the Bishop of Carlisle, the
                              Abbot of Westminster, and Aumerle._[1698]

    _Abbot._ A woeful pageant have we here beheld.[1699]

    _Car._ The woe's to come; the children yet unborn[1700]
    Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.

    _Aum._ You holy clergymen, is there no plot
    To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?                           325

    _Abbot._ My lord,[1701]
    Before I freely speak my mind herein,
    You shall not only take the sacrament
    To bury mine intents, but also to effect[1702]
    Whatever I shall happen to devise.                                  330
    I see your brows are full of discontent,
    Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:[1703]
    Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay[1704]
    A plot shall show us all a merry day.[1704]      [_Exeunt._

ACT V.


SCENE I. _London. A street leading to the Tower._

                   _Enter_ QUEEN _and_ Ladies.[1705]

    _Queen._ This way the king will come; this is the way
    To Julius Cæsar's ill-erected tower,
    To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
    Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
    Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth                            5
    Have any resting for her true king's queen.

                   _Enter_ RICHARD _and_ Guard.[1706]

    But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
    My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
    That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
    And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.                       10
    Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,[1707]
    Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
    And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
    Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,
    When triumph is become an alehouse guest?                            15

    _K. Rich._ Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
    To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
    To think our former state a happy dream;
    From which awaked, the truth of what we are
    Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,[1708]                  20
    To grim Necessity, and he and I
    Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France[1709]
    And cloister thee in some religious house:
    Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
    Which our profane hours here have stricken down.[1710]               25

    _Queen._ What, is my Richard both in shape and mind[1711]
    Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed[1712]
    Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
    The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
    And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage                     30
    To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
    Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,[1713]
    And fawn on rage with base humility,
    Which art a lion and a king of beasts?[1714]

    _K. Rich._ A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts.[1715]      35
    I had been still a happy king of men.
    Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:[1716]
    Think I am dead, and that even here thou takest,
    As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.[1717]
    In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire                           40
    With good old folks and let them tell thee tales[1718]
    Of woeful ages long ago betid;[1719]
    And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,[1720]
    Tell thou the lamentable tale of me[1721]
    And send the hearers weeping to their beds:                          45
    For why, the senseless brands will sympathize[1722][1723]
    The heavy accent of thy moving tongue[1722][1724]
    And in compassion weep the fire out;[1722]
    And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,[1722]
    For the deposing of a rightful king.[1722]                           50

               _Enter_ NORTHUMBERLAND _and_ others.[1725]

    _North._ My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed;[1726]
    You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
    And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
    With all swift speed you must away to France.

    _K. Rich._ Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal                   55
    The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
    The time shall not be many hours of age
    More than it is, ere foul sin gathering head
    Shall break into corruption: thou shalt think,[1727]
    Though he divide the realm, and give thee half,                      60
    It is too little, helping him to all;
    And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way[1728]
    To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,[1729]
    Being ne'er so little urged, another way[1730]
    To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.                       65
    The love of wicked men converts to fear;[1731]
    That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
    To worthy danger and deserved death.

    _North._ My guilt be on my head, and there an end.[1732]
    Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.                    70

    _K. Rich._ Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate[1733]
    A twofold marriage; 'twixt my crown and me,[1734]
    And then betwixt me and my married wife.
    Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;[1735]
    And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.                          75
    Part us, Northumberland; I towards the north,
    Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
    My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,[1736]
    She came adorned hither like sweet May,
    Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.[1737]                   80

    _Queen._ And must we be divided? must we part?

    _K. Rich._ Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.[1738]

    _Queen._ Banish us both and send the king with me.

    _North._ That were some love but little policy.[1739]

    _Queen._ Then whither he goes, thither let me go.[1740]              85

    _K. Rich._ So two, together weeping, make one woe.[1740]
    Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;[1740][1741]
    Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.[1740][1742]
    Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.[1740]

    _Queen._ So longest way shall have the longest moans.[1740]          90

    _K. Rich._ Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,[1740]
    And piece the way out with a heavy heart.[1740]
    Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,[1740]
    Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief:[1740]
    One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;[1740][1743]         95
    Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.[1744]

    _Queen._ Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part[1745]
    To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.[1746]
    So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
    That I may strive to kill it with a groan.                          100

    _K. Rich._ We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
    Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.                [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _The_ DUKE of YORK'S _palace_.

                 _Enter_ YORK _and his_ DUCHESS.[1747]

    _Duch._ My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
    When weeping made you break the story off[1748]
    Of our two cousins coming into London.

    _York._ Where did I leave?

    _Duch._                    At that sad stop, my lord,
    Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops[1749]                 5
    Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

    _York._ Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
    Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
    Which his aspiring rider scem'd to know,
    With slow but stately pace kept on his course,                       10
    Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee, Bolingbroke!'[1750]
    You would have thought the very windows spake,
    So many greedy looks of young and old
    Through casements darted their desiring eyes
    Upon his visage, and that all the walls                              15
    With painted imagery had said at once
    'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'[1751]
    Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,[1752]
    Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
    Bespake them thus; 'I thank you, countrymen:'[1753]                  20
    And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.

    _Duch._ Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?[1754]

    _York._ As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
    After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
    Are idly bent on him that enters next,                               25
    Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
    Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
    Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'[1755]
    No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
    But dust was thrown upon his sacred head;                            30
    Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
    His face still combating with tears and smiles,
    The badges of his grief and patience,
    That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
    The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted                    35
    And barbarism itself have pitied him.
    But heaven hath a hand in these events,
    To whose high will we bound our calm contents.[1756]
    To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,[1757]
    Whose state and honour I for aye allow.[1758]                        40

    _Duch._ Here comes my son Aumerle.[1759]

    _York._                            Aumerle that was;
    But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
    And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
    I am in parliament pledge for his truth
    And lasting fealty to the new made king.                             45

                         _Enter_ AUMERLE.[1760]

    _Duch._ Welcome, my son: who are the violets now[1761]
    That strew the green lap of the new come spring?[1762]

    _Aum._ Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:[1763]
    God knows I had as lief be none as one.

    _York._ Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,              50
    Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
    What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?[1764]

    _Aum._ For aught I know, my lord, they do.[1765]

    _York._ You will be there, I know.[1766]

    _Aum._ If God prevent not, I purpose so.[1767]                       55

    _York._ What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
    Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.[1768]

    _Aum._ My lord, 'tis nothing.

    _York._                       No matter, then, who see it:[1769]
    I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.

    _Aum._ I do beseech your grace to pardon me:                         60
    It is a matter of small consequence,
    Which for some reasons I would not have seen.

    _York._ Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
    I fear, I fear,--

    _Duch._            What should you fear?[1770]
    'Tis nothing but some band, that he is enter'd into[1771]            65
    For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.[1772]

    _York._ Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
    That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.[1773]
    Boy, let me see the writing.

    _Aum._ I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.[1774]         70

    _York._ I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.[1775]

                          [_He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it._

    Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

    _Duch._ What is the matter, my lord?[1776]

    _York._ Ho! who is within there?

                           _Enter a_ Servant.

                                   Saddle my horse.[1777]
    God for his mercy, what treachery is here![1778]                     75

    _Duch._ Why, what is it, my lord?[1779]

    _York._ Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.

                                                  [_Exit Servant._[1780]

    Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,[1781]
    I will appeach the villain.

    _Duch._                       What is the matter?[1782]

    _York._ Peace, foolish woman.[1783]                                  80

    _Duch._ I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle?[1784]

    _Aum._ Good mother, be content; it is no more
    Than my poor life must answer.

    _Duch._                          Thy life answer!

    _York._ Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.

                 _Re-enter_ Servant _with boots_.[1785]

    _Duch._ Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.              85
    Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.[1786]

    _York._ Give me my boots, I say.[1787]

    _Duch._ Why, York, what wilt thou do?
    Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?[1788]
    Have we more sons? or are we like to have?                           90
    Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
    And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
    And rob me of a happy mother's name?
    Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?

    _York._ Thou fond mad woman,[1789]                                   95
    Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
    A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
    And interchangeably set down their hands,[1790]
    To kill the king at Oxford.

    _Duch._                       He shall be none;[1791]
    We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?[1791]                100

    _York._ Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,[1792][1793]
    I would appeach him.[1792]

    _Duch._                Hadst thou groan'd for him[1794]
    As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.[1794][1795]
    But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
    That I have been disloyal to thy bed,                               105
    And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
    Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
    He is as like thee as a man may be,
    Not like to me, or any of my kin,[1796]
    And yet I love him.

    _York._               Make way, unruly woman!             [_Exit._  110

    _Duch._ After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
    Spur post, and get before him to the king,[1797]
    And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
    I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
    I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:                            115
    And never will I rise up from the ground
    Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone![1798]

                                                              [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _A royal Palace._

          _Enter_ BOLINGBROKE, PERCY, _and other_ Lords.[1799]

    _Boling._ Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?[1800]
    'Tis full three months since I did see him last:
    If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
    I would to God, my lords, he might be found:[1801]
    Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,                         5
    For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
    With unrestrained loose companions,
    Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
    And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;[1802]
    Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,[1803]                     10
    Takes on the point of honour to support[1804]
    So dissolute a crew.[1804][1805]

    _Percy._ My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
    And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.[1806]

    _Boling._ And what said the gallant?                                 15

    _Percy._ His answer was, he would unto the stews,[1807]
    And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,[1808]
    And wear it as a favour; and with that
    He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.

    _Boling._ As dissolute as desperate; yet through both[1809]          20
    I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years[1809][1810]
    May happily bring forth. But who comes here?[1809][22]

                         _Enter_ AUMERLE.[1811]

    _Aum._ Where is the king?

    _Boling._ What means our cousin, that he stares and looks[1812][1813]
    So wildly?[1812]                                                     25

    _Aum._ God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
    To have some conference with your grace alone.

    _Boling._ Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.

                                        [_Exeunt Percy and Lords._[1814]

    What is the matter with our cousin now?

    _Aum._ For ever may my knees grow to the earth,[1815]                30
    My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth,
    Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.

    _Boling._ Intended or committed was this fault?
    If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,[1816]
    To win thy after-love I pardon thee.                                 35

    _Aum._ Then give me leave that I may turn the key,[1817]
    That no man enter till my tale be done.[1818]

    _Boling._ Have thy desire.[1819]

    _York._ [_Within_] My liege, beware; look to thyself;[1820]
    Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.[1821]                     40

    _Boling._ Villain, I'll make thee safe.[1822]            [_Drawing._

    _Aum._ Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to
        fear.[1822][1823]

    _York._ [_Within_] Open the door, secure, foolhardy king:[1824]
    Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?
    Open the door, or I will break it open.                              45

                             _Enter_ YORK.

    _Boling._ What is the matter, uncle? speak;[1825][1826][1827]
    Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,[1826]
    That we may arm us to encounter it.

    _York._ Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
    The treason that my haste forbids me show.[1828]                     50

    _Aum._ Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
    I do repent me; read not my name there;
    My heart is not confederate with my hand.

    _York._ It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.[1829]
    I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;[1830]                      55
    Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:[1831]
    Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
    A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.[1832]

    _Boling._ O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
    O loyal father of a treacherous son!                                 60
    Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,[1833]
    From whence this stream through muddy passages
    Hath held his current and denied himself![1834]
    Thy overflow of good converts to bad,[1835]
    And thy abundant goodness shall excuse[1836]                         65
    This deadly blot in thy digressing son.[1837]

    _York._ So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
    And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
    As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
    Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,                           70
    Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
    Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
    The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.

    _Duch._ [_Within_] What ho, my liege! for God's sake, let me in.[1838]

    _Boling._ What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry.[1839]   75

    _Duch._ A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.[1840]
    Speak with me, pity me, open the door:
    A beggar begs that never begg'd before.

    _Boling._ Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,[1841][1842]
    And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'[1841][1842]            80
    My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
    I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.[1843]

    _York._ If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
    More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.[1844]
    This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;[1845]              85
    This let alone will all the rest confound.

                            _Enter_ DUCHESS.

    _Duch._ O king, believe not this hard-hearted man![1846]
    Love loving not itself none other can.

    _York._ Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?[1847]
    Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?                         90

    _Duch._ Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.    [_Kneels._

    _Boling._ Rise up, good aunt.

    _Duch._                       Not yet, I thee beseech:
    For ever will I walk upon my knees,[1848]
    And never see day that the happy sees,
    Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,[1849]                     95
    By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.

    _Aum._ Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.

    _York._ Against them both my true joints bended be.
    Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace![1850]

    _Duch._ Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;                   100
    His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;[1851]
    His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:[1852]
    He prays but faintly and would be denied;
    We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
    His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;                         105
    Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:[1853]
    His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
    Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
    Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have[1854]
    That mercy which true prayer ought to have.[1855]                   110

    _Boling._ Good aunt, stand up.[1856]

    _Duch._                        Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
    Say 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'[1857]
    An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,[1858]
    'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
    I never long'd to hear a word till now;                             115
    Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:[1859]
    The word is short, but not so short as sweet;[1860]
    No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.[1860][1861]

    _York._ Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'[1860][1862]

    _Duch._ Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?[1860][1863]       120
    Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,[1860]
    That set'st the word itself against the word![1860][1864]
    Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;[1860]
    The chopping French we do not understand.[1860]
    Thine eye begins to speak, set thy tongue there:[1860]              125
    Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;[1860]
    That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,[1860]
    Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.[1860][1865]

    _Boling._ Good aunt, stand up.

    _Duch._                        I do not sue to stand;
    Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.                              130

    _Boling._ I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.[1866]

    _Duch._ O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
    Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
    Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
    But makes one pardon strong.

    _Boling._                    With all my heart[1867]                135
    I pardon him.[1867]

    _Duch._       A god on earth thou art.

    _Boling._ But for our trusty brother-in-law, and the abbot,[1868]
    With all the rest of that consorted crew,
    Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
    Good uncle, help to order several powers                            140
    To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:[1869]
    They shall not live within this world, I swear,[1870]
    But I will have them, if I once know where.[1870][1871]
    Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:[1870][1872]
    Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.[1870]             145

    _Duch._ Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.[1866][1870]

                                                        [_Exeunt._[1873]


SCENE IV. _The same._

                   _Enter_ EXTON _and_ Servant.[1874]

    _Exton._ Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,[1875]
    'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
    Was it not so?

    _Ser._         These were his very words.[1876][1877]

    _Exton._ 'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice.[1878]
    And urged it twice together, did he not?                              5

    _Ser._ He did.[1876]

    _Exton._ And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me;[1879]
    As who should say, 'I would thou wert the man[1880]
    That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
    Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:                         10
    I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.       [_Exeunt._[1881]


SCENE V. _Pomfret castle._

                      _Enter_ KING RICHARD.[1882]

    _K. Rich._ I have been studying how I may compare[1883]
    This prison where I live unto the world:
    And for because the world is populous
    And here is not a creature but myself,
    I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.[1884]                         5
    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,[1885]
    My soul the father; and these two beget
    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
    And these same thoughts people this little world,
    In humours like the people of this world,                            10
    For no thought is contented. The better sort,[1886]
    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
    With scruples and do set the word itself[1887]
    Against the word:[1887][1888][1889]
    As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,[1888]                  15
    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'[1890]
    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
    Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs[1891]                     20
    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars[1892]                  25
    Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,[1893]
    That many have and others must sit there;[1894]
    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back[1895]
    Of such as have before endured the like.                             30
    Thus play I in one person many people,[1896]
    And none contented: sometimes am I king;[1897]
    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,[1898]
    And so I am: then crushing penury
    Persuades me I was better when a king;                               35
    Then am I king'd again: and by and by[1899]
    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
    And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,[1900]
    Nor I nor any man that but man is
    With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased[1901]                40
    With being nothing. Music do I hear?                 [_Music._[1902]
    Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
    So is it in the music of men's lives.
    And here have I the daintiness of ear[1903]                          45
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;[1904]
    But for the concord of my state and time
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
    For now hath time made me his numbering clock:[1905]                 50
    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar[1906]
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,[1907]
    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is[1908]                  55
    Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,[1909]
    Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans[1910]
    Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time[1911]
    Runs, posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
    While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.[1912]             60
    This music mads me; let it sound no more;[1913]
    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.[1914]
    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard                         65
    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

                  _Enter a_ Groom of the Stable.[1915]

    _Groom._ Hail, royal prince![1916]

    _K. Rich._                   Thanks, noble peer;[1917]
    The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.[1917][1918]
    What art thou? and how comest thou hither,[1919]
    Where no man never comes, but that sad dog[1920]                     70
    That brings me food to make misfortune live?

    _Groom._ I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
    When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
    With much ado at length have gotten leave
    To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.[1921]                 75
    O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld[1922]
    In London streets, that coronation-day,
    When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
    That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,[1923]
    That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!                         80

    _K. Rich._ Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
    How went he under him?

    _Groom._ So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.[1924]

    _K. Rich._ So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
    That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;                         85
    This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
    Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
    Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
    Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
    Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,                           90
    Since thou, created to be awed by man,
    Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
    And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
    Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jauncing Bolingbroke.

                  _Enter_ Keeper, _with a dish_.[1925]

    _Keep._ Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.[1926]            95

    _K. Rich._ If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.

    _Groom._ What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.

                                                          [_Exit._[1927]

    _Keep._ My lord, will't please you to fall to?[1928]

    _K. Rich._ Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.[1929]

    _Keep._ My lord, I dare not: sir Pierce of Exton, who[1930][1931]   100
    lately came from the king, commands the contrary.[1930][1932]

    _K. Rich._ The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee![1933]
    Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.  [_Beats the Keeper._[1934]

    _Keep._ Help, help, help!

              _Enter_ EXTON _and_ Servants, _armed_.[1935]

    _K. Rich._ How now! what means death in this rude assault?[1936]    105
    Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.

               [_Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him._[1937]

    Go thou, and fill another room in hell.

                 [_He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down._[1938]

    That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
    That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand[1939]
    Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.             110
    Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
    Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.    [_Dies._[1940]

    _Exton._ As full of valour as of royal blood:
    Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good![1941]
    For now the devil, that told me I did well,                         115
    Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
    This dead king to the living king I'll bear:
    Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.     [_Exeunt._[1942]


SCENE VI. _Windsor castle._

     _Flourish. Enter_ BOLINGBROKE, YORK, _with other_ Lords, _and_
                           Attendants.[1943]

    _Boling._ Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear[1944]
    Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
    Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;[1945]
    But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.

                     _Enter_ NORTHUMBERLAND.[1946]

    Welcome, my lord: what is the news?[1947][1948]                       5

    _North._ First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.[1947]
    The next news is, I have to London sent
    The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:[1949]
    The manner of their taking may appear
    At large discoursed in this paper here.                              10

    _Boling._ We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
    And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

                        _Enter_ FITZWATER.[1950]

    _Fitz._ My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
    The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,[1951]
    Two of the dangerous consorted traitors                              15
    That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.

    _Boling._ Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;[1952]
    Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.[1953]

               _Enter_ PERCY, and the BISHOP of CARLISLE.

    _Percy._ The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
    With clog of conscience and sour melancholy                          20
    Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
    But here is Carlisle living, to abide[1954]
    Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.

    _Boling._ Carlisle, this is your doom:[1955]
    Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,[1956]              25
    More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;[1957]
    So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
    For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
    High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.

         _Enter_ EXTON, _with persons bearing a coffin_.[1958]

    _Exton._ Great king, within this coffin I present                    30
    Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
    The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,[1959]
    Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.[1960]

    _Boling._ Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
    A deed of slander, with thy fatal hand,[1961]                        35
    Upon my head and all this famous land.

    _Exton._ From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.[1962]

    _Boling._ They love not poison that do poison need,
    Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
    I hate the murderer, love him murdered.                              40
    The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
    But neither my good word nor princely favour:
    With Cain go wander thorough shades of night,[1963]
    And never show thy head by day nor light.[1964]
    Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,                            45
    That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:[1965]
    Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,[1966]
    And put on sullen black incontinent:[1967]
    I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,[1968]
    To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:                          50
    March sadly after; grace my mournings here;[1969]
    In weeping after this untimely bier.                [_Exeunt._[1970]

NOTES.


NOTE I.

DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. We have made some slight changes in the titles and
order of the _dramatis personæ_ in accordance with the suggestion of Mr
George Russell French, who writes to us: "Why should Edmund Langley be
placed before his elder brother John of Gaunt? The title of 'Berkely'
should be simply 'Lord,' as that family were not made Earls till the
time of Charles II. Shakespeare only calls him 'Lorde Barkley.' I
would recommend that the name of 'Sir Pierce Exton' should be placed
after that of 'Sir Stephen Scroop,' as the latter was actually a baron
of Parliament. The 'Duchess of York' should have precedence over the
'Duchess of Gloucester,' whose husband was the youngest son of Edward
III."


NOTE II.

I. 1. 2. _Band_ is given by Minsheu with the sense of 'obligation'
(_Guide into Tongues_, 1617). Both words _band_ and _bond_ were
concurrently in use with the same sense. In this play, V. 2. 65, the
first four Quartos read _band_, the Folios and the fifth Quarto _bond_,
while in the 67th line both Quartos and Folios agree in _bond_.


NOTE III.

I. 1. 149. In this place and in several others Capell in his _Various
Readings_ has attributed the reading of the fourth Quarto to the
third. The same error is found 34. 5, _Brittaine_; 46. 22, _two_; 46.
31, _profession_; 47. 11, _impresse_; 48. 21, _from my_; 49. 26, _can
cannot_; 78. 17, _night_; 88. 30, _the how_; 92. 18, _have holp_.


NOTE IV.

SCENE II. As usual, there is no division into Acts and Scenes in the
Quartos. We follow generally the Folios in their arrangement, carefully
noting the exceptions.


NOTE V.

I. 2. 1. We retain here the reading of the Quartos which is doubtless
what Shakespeare wrote. Probably it was altered for the stage, because
'Thomas of Woodstock' was better known to the audience by his title
'Duke of Gloucester.'


NOTE VI.

I. 2. 70. Notwithstanding the paramount authority of the first Quarto
we conceive that the antithesis between _there see_, line 67, and _hear
there_, is too marked to admit of a doubt that the reading of the
second is to be preferred in this place.


NOTE VII.

I. 3. 7. The stage direction in the text is made up of those given in
the Quartos and Folios. The first Quarto has: _The trumpets sound and
the King enters with his nobles; when they are set, enter the Duke of
Norfolke in armes defendant_.

The first Folio has: _Flourish. Enter King, Gaunt, Bushy, Bagot,
Greene, and others: Then Mowbray in Armor, and Harrold._

At I. 3. 25, the first Quarto gives as the stage direction, _The
trumpets sound. Enter Duke of Hereford appellant in armour_. The
first Folio has simply, _Tucket. Enter Hereford, and Harold._


NOTE VIII.

I. 3. 20. Notwithstanding that the emendation of the Folios yields
an easier sense, we follow the reading of the Quartos, which may be
explained, inasmuch as the Duke of Norfolk's 'succeeding issue' would
be involved in the forfeiture incurred by disloyalty to his king. It
may also be noted that King Richard had never any issue.


NOTE IX.

I. 3. 127. Capell's copy of the first Quarto has _cruell_. Another copy
is said, in the Variorum edition of 1821, to have the reading _civil_
(or _civill_), but we have been unable to trace it. Mr George Daniel,
who possesses the only known copy besides Capell's, informs us that it
has _cruell_.


NOTE X.

I. 3. 129-133. Pope first restored to the text the five lines omitted
in the Folios and the fifth Quarto. He found them in the Quarto of
1598, which he took to be 'the first edition.' Warburton 'put them,' as
he says, 'into hooks, not as spurious, but as rejected on the author's
revise.' Capell omitted the five lines next following. ''Tis probable,'
he says, 'that the lines now omitted were left negligently in the MS.
from which the Quarto was printed; that a mark was set on them when the
Folio came out, but mistook by the printer of it, who changed the sound
for the unsound.'


NOTE XI.

I. 3. 150. Some commentators have quoted the second Folio as reading
'slye slow.' In Capell's copy and in Long's it is certainly 'flye
slow.' Mr Collier in a letter to _Notes and Queries_ mentions that he
has found 'flye slow' in other copies.


NOTE XII.

I. 3. 239-242. Pope introduced the two last of the lines he omitted
in this place at the end of Gaunt's speech after line 245. Theobald
restored lines 239, 240 to their original place, but left lines 241,
242 as he found them in Pope.


NOTE XIII.

II. 1. 40-55. _This royal throne ... stubborn Jewry._ This passage,
with the exception of line 50, is quoted in _England's Parnassus_, p.
348 (1600), and is there attributed to _M. Dr._, i.e. Michael Drayton,
whose _England's Heroical Epistles_ had been published two years
before. The three lines I. 1. 177-179 are also quoted at p. 113 of the
same collection.


NOTE XIV.

II. 1. 254. The Folios omitted _noble_, in order to correct the
redundant line. But Alexandrines occur too frequently in this play
to admit of the supposition that they are all due to printers' or
transcribers' errors. The author probably found the occasional
recurrence of a six foot line no stumbling-block in the even road of
his blank verse.


NOTE XV.

II. 1. 277, 278. Pope makes a bold emendation here:

    'Then thus, my friends. I have from Port le Blanc,
    A bay in Bretagne, had intelligence, &c.'

The first Quarto reads thus:

    'Then thus, I have from le Port Blan
    A Bay in Brittaine receiude intelligence, &c.'

And, excepting that Q₃ reads '_Brittanie_,' the rest are substantially
the same.

The first Folio has 'Port _le Blan_' and '_Britaine_.'

The arrangement of the lines in the text agrees with Capell's.


NOTE XVI.

II. 1. 279 sqq. This passage stands thus in the first Quarto:

    'That Harry duke of Herford, Rainold L. Cobham
    That late broke from the Duke of Exeter
    His brother, archbishop late of Canterburie,
    Sir Thomas Erpingham, sir John Ramston
    Sir Iohn Norbery, sir Robert Waterton and Francis Coines:'

and the three following are almost the same to a letter.

For 'Ramston' and 'Coines' the first Folio has 'Rainston' and 'Quoint.'

According to Holinshed it was not Lord Cobham but 'Thomas Arundell' who
escaped from the Duke of Exeter's house, where he was kept.

In order to make Shakespeare and the Chronicler agree, Capell reads:

    'That _Harry Hereford, Reignold_ lord _Cobham_;
    The archbishop late of _Canterbury_; his nephew
    That late broke from the duke of Exeter; &c.'

Malone introduces within brackets the following line:

                '[The son of Richard earl of Arundel].'

His view that a line is lost seems to us more probable than Capell's
transpositions, omission, and insertion. And as Shakespeare evidently
wrote with Holinshed before him, it is not probable that he would have
made such an error as we find in the printed text.

Ritson proposed to fill up the gap with

           '[The son and heir of the late earl of Arundel],'

which is taken almost verbatim from Holinshed.


NOTE XVII.

II. 2. 109. The Quarto of 1597 reads the lines thus:

    'Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
    If I know how or which way to order these affayres
    Thus, &c.'

The other editions have the same arrangement (the Folios omitting 'go'
in the first line).

Pope reads:

    'Gentlemen, will you go and muster men?
    If I know how to order these affairs,
    Disorderly thrust, &c.'

Capell reads:

    'Gentlemen, will you muster men? if I know
    How, or which way, to order these affairs
    Thus most disorderly thrust, &c.'

Mr Dyce has:

    'Gentlemen, will you go muster men? if I know
    How, or which way, &c.'

Mr Staunton says in a note: The redundant _or which way_ I have always
suspected to be an interlineation of the poet's, who had not decided
whether to read '_how_ to order these affairs,' or '_which way_ to
order.'

Perhaps the author in expressing York's agitation and perplexity,
instinctively broke into irregular rhythm, and the rest of the speech
might be printed as prose.


NOTE XVIII.

II. 3. 5. The fact that _Drawes_ (not _Draws_) is the reading of the
first Quarto tends to show that the singular is not a misprint for
the plural. The construction is not unfrequent in Shakespeare nor in
colloquial language even at the present time. It is as if the author
had said, 'Travelling over these high wild hills, &c. Draws....'


NOTE XIX.

III. 2. 70. Theobald in a letter to Warburton, Nichols'
_Illustrations_, Vol. II. p. 398, suggests that in lines 70, 76, 85,
we should read 'forty thousand,' because Holinshed says that Lord
Salisbury raised forty thousand men in Wales for the King.

But the proposed reading would not suit the metre in line 70; and it is
difficult to see how the mistake should have arisen in two places if
the poet had written 'forty' originally in all three.


NOTE XX.

III. 3. 52. Capell seems to have printed '_the_ castle's' by mistake
for '_this_ castle's'--the reading of all the old copies. The mistake
was copied in several subsequent editions.


NOTE XXI.

    III. 4. 22. 'And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
                 And never borrow any tear of thee.'

Although most editors have acquiesced in Pope's conjecture '_weep_' for
'_sing_,' we retain '_sing_,' which all the Quartos and Folios agree
in. The mistake is not one which a transcriber or printer would be
likely to make, and the original reading yields a very good sense. The
Queen speaks with an emphasis on 'sing:' 'And I could even sing for joy
if my troubles were only such as weeping could alleviate, and then I
would not ask you to weep for me.'


NOTE XXII.

IV. 1. 52. Pope added to Aumerle's speech three lines he found in the
Quarto, beginning 'Who sets me else ...?' without intimating that it
contained other five lines, 'I task thee ... thou dar'st,' which he
omitted. The omission escaped the notice of Theobald and Warburton.
Johnson was the first to supply it. He added in a note: 'This speech
I have restored from the first edition in humble imitation of former
editors, though, I believe, against the mind of the authour. For _the
earth_ I suppose we ought to read, _thy oath_.'


NOTE XXIII.

IV. 1. 280 sqq. The third and fourth Quartos (the earliest editions
which contain this scene) read here:

                            '... prosperitie.
    Was this the face that euery day vnder his
    Houshold roofe did keepe ten thousand men?
    Was this the face that faast so many follies,
    And was ...'

The first Folio has:

                            '... prosperitie,
    Thou do'st beguile me. Was this Face, the Face
    That every day, vnder his House-hold Roofe,
    Did keepe ten thousand men? Was this the Face,
    That like the Sunne, did make beholders winke?
    Is this the Face, which fac'd so many follyes,
    That was ...'


NOTE XXIV.

V. 1. 88. Sidney Walker (_Criticisms_, Vol. I. p. 189-193) has
collected instances of 'near' and 'far' used in the sense of 'nearer'
and 'farther.' For an instance of the latter, see _Winter's Tale_, IV.
4. 420, 'Far than Deucalion off.'


NOTE XXV.

V. 2. 28. Possibly 'God save him' should be printed in a line by itself.


NOTE XXVI.

V. 2. 57. Malone says of this passage: 'Perhaps like many other
speeches in this scene it was not intended for verse.'


NOTE XXVII.

V. 3. 12. Mr Staunton thinks that the words 'So dissolute a crew' were
part of a line which was intended to be cancelled, or to supply the
place of 'even such they say,' line 8.


NOTE XXVIII.

V. 3. 21-24. Capell's arrangement is as follows:

    'As dissolute as desperate: yet through both,
    I see some _sparkles of_ a better hope,
    Which elder years may happily bring forth.
    But who comes here?'


NOTE XXIX.

V. 3. 66. Steevens, in his edition of 1778, says, 'The modern editors
read:--_transgressing_.' The only edition in which we have found this
reading is that of Johnson and Steevens, 1773.


NOTE XXX.

V. 3. 137. Theobald reads:

            'But for our trusty brother-in-law,--the Abbot,'

and adds in a note: 'Without these marks of disjunction, ... the abbot
here mention'd and Bolingbroke's brother-in-law seem to be one and the
same person: but this was not the case.... The brother-in-law, meant,
was John Duke of Exeter and Earl of Huntingdon, (own brother to King
Richard II.) and who had married with the lady Elizabeth sister to
Henry of Bolingbroke.'


NOTE XXXI.

V. 3. 144. 'Cousin too, adieu,' which is generally attributed to
Theobald, is really the reading of the Quarto of 1634 (Q₅).

Perhaps the line may be amended thus:

           'Uncle, farewell; farewell, aunt; cousin, adieu.'

Many as harsh-sounding lines may be found, and it seems only consonant
with good manners that the king should take leave of his aunt as well
as of the others. There is a propriety too in his using a colder form
of leave-taking to his guilty cousin than to his uncle and aunt.


NOTE XXXII.

V. 4. 94. Mr Staunton says that Q₁ reads 'Spurn'd, gall'd.' Our copy
has 'Spurrde, galld.' Though 'Spur-gall'd' is an extremely probable
correction, we adhere to our rule of following the higher authority
whenever it seems to yield a reasonable sense.

ACT I.


SCENE I. _London. The palace._

       _Enter_ KING HENRY, LORD JOHN of LANCASTER, _the_ EARL of
          WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, _and others_.[1971]

    _King._ So shaken as we are, so wan with care,[1972]
    Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
    And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
    To be commenced in stronds afar remote.[1973]
    No more the thirsty entrance of this soil[1974]                       5
    Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;[1975]
    No more shall trenching war channel her fields,
    Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs[1976][1977]
    Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,[1977][1978]
    Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,                        10
    All of one nature, of one substance bred,
    Did lately meet in the intestine shock
    And furious close of civil butchery
    Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,[1979]
    March all one way and be no more opposed                             15
    Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:[1980]
    The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
    No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
    As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
    Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross[1981]                   20
    We are impressed and engaged to fight,
    Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;[1982]
    Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb[1983]
    To chase these pagans in those holy fields[1984]
    Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet                           25
    Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
    For our advantage on the bitter cross.
    But this our purpose now is twelve month old,[1985]
    And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
    Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear                          30
    Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
    What yesternight our council did decree
    In forwarding this dear expedience.[1986]

    _West._ My liege, this haste was hot in question,
    And many limits of the charge set down                               35
    But yesternight: when all athwart there came
    A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
    Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
    Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight[1987]
    Against the irregular and wild Glendower,                            40
    Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,[1988]
    A thousand of his people butchered;[1989]
    Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,[1990]
    Such beastly shameless transformation,[1991]
    By those Welshwomen done, as may not be                              45
    Without much shame retold or spoken of.[1992]

    _King._ It seems then that the tidings of this broil
    Brake off our business for the Holy Land.

    _West._ This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;[1993]
    For more uneven and unwelcome news[1994]                             50
    Came from the north and thus it did import:[1995]
    On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
    Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,
    That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
    At Holmedon met,[1996][1997]                                         55
    Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour;[1996]
    As by discharge of their artillery,
    And shape of likelihood, the news was told;[1998]
    For he that brought them, in the very heat[1999]
    And pride of their contention did take horse,                        60
    Uncertain of the issue any way.

    _King._ Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,[2000]
    Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,
    Stain'd with the variation of each soil[2001]
    Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;[2002]                   65
    And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.[2003]
    The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
    Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,[2004]
    Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see[2005]
    On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took[2006]               70
    Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son[2007]
    To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,[2008][2009]
    Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:[2009][2010]
    And is not this an honourable spoil?
    A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?[2011]                        75

    _West._ In faith,[2011]
    It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.[2011]

    _King._ Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
    In envy that my Lord Northumberland
    Should be the father to so blest a son,[2012]                        80
    A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
    Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
    Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
    Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
    See riot and dishonour stain the brow                                85
    Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved[2013]
    That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
    In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,[2014]
    And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet![2015]
    Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.                            90
    But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,[2016]
    Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
    Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
    To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
    I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.                          95

    _West._ This is his uncle's teaching: this is Worcester,
    Malevolent to you in all aspects;
    Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up[2017]
    The crest of youth against your dignity.

    _King._ But I have sent for him to answer this;                     100
    And for this cause awhile we must neglect
    Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
    Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we[2018]
    Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:[2018][2019]
    But come yourself with speed to us again;                           105
    For more is to be said and to be done[2020]
    Than out of anger can be uttered.

    _West._ I will, my liege.                                 [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _London. An apartment of the Prince's._

           _Enter the_ PRINCE of WALES _and_ FALSTAFF.[2021]

    _Fal._ Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?

    _Prince._ Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old[2022]
    sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
    benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand[2023]
    that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil                5
    hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours
    were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the
    tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping-houses
    and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-coloured
    taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so[2024]               10
    superfluous to demand the time of the day.

    _Fal._ Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that[2025]
    take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not[2026]
    by Phœbus, he, 'that wandering knight so fair.' And, I
    prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God save[2027]           15
    thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have
    none,--

    _Prince._ What, none?

    _Fal._ No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to[2028]
    be prologue to an egg and butter.                                    20

    _Prince._ Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.

    _Fal._ Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let
    not us that are squires of the night's body be called thieves
    of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen[2029]
    of the shade, minions of the moon; and let men say we                25
    be men of good government, being governed, as the sea
    is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose
    countenance we steal.[2030]

    _Prince._ Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for
    the fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and               30
    flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, by the
    moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold most resolutely[2031]
    snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on
    Tuesday morning; got with swearing 'Lay by' and spent[2032]
    with crying 'Bring in;' now in as low an ebb as the foot of          35
    the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of[2033]
    the gallows.

    _Fal._ By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not[2034]
    my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?[2035]

    _Prince._ As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the[2036]             40
    castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of
    durance?

    _Fal._ How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy
    quips and thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with
    a buff jerkin?                                                       45

    _Prince._ Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess
    of the tavern?

    _Fal._ Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many[2037]
    a time and oft.

    _Prince._ Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?                  50

    _Fal._ No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all
    there.

    _Prince._ Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would
    stretch; and where it would not, I have used my credit.

    _Fal._ Yea, and so used it that, were it not here apparent[2038]     55
    that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet[2039]
    wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou
    art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is with the rusty[2040]
    curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou, when thou
    art king, hang a thief.[2041]                                        60

    _Prince._ No; thou shalt.

    _Fal._ Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave[2042]
    judge.

    _Prince._ Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou
    shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a                65
    rare hangman.

    _Fal._ Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with
    my humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.

    _Prince._ For obtaining of suits?

    _Fal._ Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman              70
    hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a[2043]
    gib cat or a lugged bear.[2044]

    _Prince._ Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.

    _Fal._ Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.[2045]

    _Prince._ What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy              75
    of Moor-ditch?

    _Fal._ Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art[2046]
    indeed the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young[2047]
    prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more with
    vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity[2048]       80
    of good names were to be bought. An old lord of
    the council rated me the other day in the street about you,[2049]
    sir, but I marked him not; and yet he talked very[2049]
    wisely, but I regarded him not; and yet he talked wisely,[2050]
    and in the street too.[2051]                                         85

    _Prince._ Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the[2052]
    streets, and no man regards it.[2052][2053]

    _Fal._ O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed[2054]
    able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon[2055]
    me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee,                90
    Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man should[2056]
    speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must
    give over this life, and I will give it over: by the Lord, an[2057]
    I do not, I am a villain: I'll be damned for never a king's
    son in Christendom.                                                  95

    _Prince._ Where shall we take a purse to-morrow, Jack?

    _Fal._ 'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an[2058]
    I do not, call me villain and baffle me.

    _Prince._ I see a good amendment of life in thee; from
    praying to purse-taking.                                            100

    _Fal._ Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for
    a man to labour in his vocation.

                          _Enter_ POINS.[2059]

    Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match.[2060][2061]
    O, if men were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell
    were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent                105
    villain that ever cried 'Stand' to a true man.

    _Prince._ Good morrow, Ned.

    _Poins._ Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur
    Remorse? what says Sir John Sack and Sugar?[2062]
    Jack! how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul,
        that[2062][2063]                                                110
    thou soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
    and a cold capon's leg?

    _Prince._ Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall
    have his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs:[2064]
    he will give the devil his due.[2065]                               115

    _Poins._ Then art thou damned for keeping thy word
    with the devil.

    _Prince._ Else he had been damned for cozening the[2066]
    devil.

    _Poins._ But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by               120
    four o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going to[2067]
    Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London
    with fat purses: I have vizards for you all; you have
    horses for yourselves: Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester:
    I have bespoke supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we[2068]        125
    may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
    your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry at home[2069]
    and be hanged.

    _Fal._ Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go[2070]
    not, I'll hang you for going.                                       130

    _Poins._ You will, chops?

    _Fal._ Hal, wilt thou make one?

    _Prince._ Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.[2071]

    _Fal._ There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship
    in thee, nor thou earnest not of the blood royal, if[2072]          135
    thou darest not stand for ten shillings.[2073]

    _Prince._ Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.

    _Fal._ Why, that's well said.

    _Prince._ Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.

    _Fal._ By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou[2074]         140
    art king.

    _Prince._ I care not.

    _Poins._ Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me[2075]
    alone: I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
    that he shall go.                                                   145

    _Fal._ Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and[2076]
    him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may[2076]
    move and what he hears may be believed, that the true[2077]
    prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false thief; for the
    poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell: you             150
    shall find me in Eastcheap.

    _Prince._ Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, Allhallown[2078]
    summer!                                      [_Exit Falstaff._[2079]

    _Poins._ Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
    to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage            155
    alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill shall rob[2080]
    those men that we have already waylaid; yourself and I
    will not be there; and when they have the booty, if you
    and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders.[2081]

    _Prince._ How shall we part with them in setting[2082]              160
    forth?

    _Poins._ Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
    appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure
    to fail, and then will they adventure upon the exploit
    themselves; which they shall have no sooner achieved, but[2083]     165
    we'll set upon them.

    _Prince._ Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by[2084]
    our horses, by our habits and by every other appointment,
    to be ourselves.

    _Poins._ Tut! our horses they shall not see; I'll tie               170
    them in the wood; our vizards we will change after we[2085]
    leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the[2086]
    nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.

    _Prince._ Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.[2087]

    _Poins._ Well, for two of them, I know them to be as[2088][2089]    175
    true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the third,[2089]
    if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms.
    The virtue of this jest will be, the incomprehensible lies
    that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper:[2090]
    how thirty, at least, he fought with; what wards, what[2091]        180
    blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of[2092]
    this lies the jest.[2093]

    _Prince._ Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
    necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;[2094]
    there I'll sup. Farewell.                                           185

    _Poins._ Farewell, my lord.                                 [_Exit._

    _Prince._ I know you all, and will awhile uphold
    The unyoked humour of your idleness:
    Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
    Who doth permit the base contagious clouds                          190
    To smother up his beauty from the world,
    That, when he please again to be himself,
    Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
    By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
    Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.                           195
    If all the year were playing holidays,
    To sport would be as tedious as to work;
    But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
    And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
    So, when this loose behaviour I throw off                           200
    And pay the debt I never promised,
    By how much better than my word I am,
    By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;[2095]
    And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
    My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,                           205
    Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
    Than that which hath no foil to set it off.[2096]
    I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
    Redeeming time when men think least I will.           [_Exit._[2097]


SCENE III. _London. The palace._[2098]

         _Enter the_ KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR,
                   SIR WALTER BLUNT, _with others_.

    _King._ My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
    Unapt to stir at these indignities,
    And you have found me; for accordingly[2099]
    You tread upon my patience: but be sure[2100]
    I will from henceforth rather be myself,                              5
    Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;[2101]
    Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,[2102]
    And therefore lost that title of respect[2103]
    Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.[2104]

    _Wor._ Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves                10
    The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
    And that same greatness too which our own hands
    Have holp to make so portly.[2105]

    _North._ My lord,--[2106]

    _King._ Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see[2107]                 15
    Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
    O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,[2108]
    And majesty might never yet endure
    The moody frontier of a servant brow.[2109]
    You have good leave to leave us: when we need                        20
    Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.      [_Exit Wor._[2110]
    You were about to speak.                                [_To North._

    _North._                 Yea, my good lord.[2111]
    Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,[2112]
    Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,[2113]
    Were, as he says, not with such strength denied[2114]                25
    As is deliver'd to your majesty:[2115]
    Either envy, therefore, or misprision[2116]
    Is guilty of this fault and not my son.[2117]

    _Hot._ My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
    But I remember, when the fight was done,                             30
    When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
    Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
    Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,[2118]
    Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
    Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;                          35
    He was perfumed like a milliner;
    And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
    A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
    He gave his nose and took 't away again;[2119]
    Who therewith angry, when it next came there,[2119]                  40
    Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,[2119][2120]
    And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,[2121]
    He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
    To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
    Betwixt the wind and his nobility.                                   45
    With many holiday and lady terms[2122]
    He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded[2123]
    My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
    I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,[2124]
    To be so pester'd with a popinjay,[2125][2126]                       50
    Out of my grief and my impatience,[2125]
    Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
    He should, or he should not; for he made me mad[2127]
    To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
    And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman                               55
    Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
    And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth[2128]
    Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
    And that it was great pity, so it was,
    This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd[2129]                     60
    Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
    Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
    So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
    He would himself have been a soldier.[2130]
    This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,                            65
    I answer'd indirectly, as I said;[2131]
    And I beseech you, let not his report[2132]
    Come current for an accusation
    Betwixt my love and your high majesty.

    _Blunt._ The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,                  70
    Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said[2133]
    To such a person and in such a place,
    At such a time, with all the rest re-told,
    May reasonably die and never rise
    To do him wrong or any way impeach                                   75
    What then he said, so he unsay it now.[2134]

    _King._ Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,[2135]
    But with proviso and exception,
    That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
    His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;                            80
    Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd[2136]
    The lives of those that he did lead to fight
    Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,[2137]
    Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March[2138]
    Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,                        85
    Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
    Shall we buy treason? and indent with fears,[2139]
    When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
    No, on the barren mountains let him starve;[2140]
    For I shall never hold that man my friend                            90
    Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
    To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

    _Hot._ Revolted Mortimer!
    He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,[2141]
    But by the chance of war: to prove that true[2141][2142]             95
    Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,[2143]
    Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,
    When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,[2144]
    In single opposition, hand to hand,
    He did confound the best part of an hour                            100
    In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
    Three times they breathed and three times did they drink,
    Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
    Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
    Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,                            105
    And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank[2145]
    Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
    Never did base and rotten policy[2146]
    Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
    Nor never could the noble Mortimer[2147]                            110
    Receive so many, and all willingly:
    Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.[2148]

    _King._ Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;[2149]
    He never did encounter with Glendower:
    I tell thee,[2150]                                                  115
    He durst as well have met the devil alone
    As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
    Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth[2151]
    Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
    Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,                    120
    Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
    As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,[2152]
    We license your departure with your son.
    Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.

                           [_Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train._[2153]

    _Hot._ An if the devil come and roar for them,[2154]                125
    I will not send them: I will after straight
    And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
    Albeit I make a hazard of my head.[2155]

    _North._ What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
    Here comes your uncle.

                      _Re-enter_ WORCESTER.[2156]

    _Hot._                   Speak of                                   130
    'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul[2157]
    Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
    Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,[2158]
    And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,[2159]
    But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer[2160]                        135
    As high in the air as this unthankful king,[2161]
    As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.

    _North._ Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.

    _Wor._ Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

    _Hot._ He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;                    140
    And when I urged the ransom once again
    Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
    And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
    Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.

    _Wor._ I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd[2162]              145
    By Richard that dead is the next of blood?[2163]

    _North._ He was; I heard the proclamation:
    And then it was when the unhappy king,--
    Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
    Upon his Irish expedition;                                          150
    From whence he intercepted did return
    To be deposed and shortly murdered.

    _Wor._ And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
    Live scandalized and foully spoken of.[2164]

    _Hot._ But, soft, I pray you; did King Richard then                 155
    Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer[2165]
    Heir to the crown?

    _North._           He did; myself did hear it.

    _Hot._ Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
    That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve.[2166]
    But shall it be, that you, that set the crown                       160
    Upon the head of this forgetful man
    And for his sake wear the detested blot[2167]
    Of murderous subornation, shall it be,[2168]
    That you a world of curses undergo,
    Being the agents, or base second means,                             165
    The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?[2169]
    O, pardon me that I descend so low,[2170]
    To show the line and the predicament
    Wherein you range under this subtle king;
    Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,                         170
    Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
    That men of your nobility and power
    Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,[2171]
    As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
    To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,                        175
    And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
    And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
    That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
    By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
    No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem                          180
    Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves[2172]
    Into the good thoughts of the world again,
    Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
    Of this proud king, who studies day and night
    To answer all the debt he owes to you[2173]                         185
    Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:[2174]
    Therefore, I say,--

    _Wor._              Peace, cousin, say no more:
    And now I will unclasp a secret book,[2175]
    And to your quick-conceiving discontents[2176]
    I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,[2177]                      190
    As full of peril and adventurous spirit
    As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud[2178]
    On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.[2179]

    _Hot._ If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:[2180]
    Send danger from the east unto the west,                            195
    So honour cross it from the north to south,[2181]
    And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs[2182]
    To rouse a lion than to start a hare!

    _North._ Imagination of some great exploit
    Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.                           200

    _Hot._ By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,[2183]
    To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
    Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
    Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
    And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;                           205
    So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
    Without corrival all her dignities:[2184]
    But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

    _Wor._ He apprehends a world of figures here,
    But not the form of what he should attend.[2185]                    210
    Good cousin, give me audience for a while.[2186]

    _Hot._ I cry you mercy.

    _Wor._                  Those same noble Scots[2187]
    That are your prisoners,--[2187]

    _Hot._                    I'll keep them all;
    By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;[2188]
    No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:                    215
    I'll keep them, by this hand.

    _Wor._                      You start away
    And lend no ear unto my purposes.
    Those prisoners you shall keep.

    _Hot._                         Nay, I will; that's flat:[2189]
    He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
    Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;                              220
    But I will find him when he lies asleep,
    And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'[2190]
    Nay,[2191]
    I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak[2191]
    Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him,[2192]                      225
    To keep his anger still in motion.

    _Wor._ Hear you, cousin; a word.[2193]

    _Hot._ All studies here I solemnly defy,
    Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
    And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,                    230
    But that I think his father loves him not
    And would be glad he met with some mischance,
    I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.[2194]

    _Wor._ Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you[2195]
    When you are better temper'd to attend.                             235

    _North._ Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool[2196]
    Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
    Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own![2197]

    _Hot._ Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
    Nettled, and stung with pismires, when I hear                       240
    Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
    In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--[2198]
    A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;[2199]
    'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept.
    His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee                         245
    Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--[2200]
    'Sblood!--[2201]
    When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.

    _North._ At Berkley-castle.

    _Hot._ You say true:                                                250
    Why, what a candy deal of courtesy[2202]
    This fawning greyhound then did proffer me![2203]
    Look, 'when his infant fortune came to age,'[2204]
    And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
    O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me![2205]              255
    Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.[2206][2207]

    _Wor._ Nay, if you have not, to it again;[2206][2208][2209]
    We will stay your leisure.[2206][2208]

    _Hot._                    I have done, i' faith.[2210]

    _Wor._ Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
    Deliver them up without their ransom straight,                      260
    And make the Douglas' son your only mean[2211]
    For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
    Which I shall send you written, be assured,
    Will easily be granted. You, my lord,[2212]      [_To Northumberland._
    Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,                           265
    Shall secretly into the bosom creep[2213]
    Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
    The archbishop.

    _Hot._ Of York, is it not?[2214]

    _Wor._ True; who bears hard                                         270
    His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.[2215]
    I speak not this in estimation,
    As what I think might be, but what I know
    Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
    And only stays but to behold the face                               275
    Of that occasion that shall bring it on.

    _Hot._ I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.[2216]

    _North._ Before the game is a-foot, thou still let'st slip.[2217]

    _Hot._ Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot:[2218]
    And then the power of Scotland and of York,                         280
    To join with Mortimer, ha?

    _Wor._                     And so they shall.[2219]

    _Hot._ In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.

    _Wor._ And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
    To save our heads by raising of a head;
    For, bear ourselves as even as we can,                              285
    The king will always think him in our debt,
    And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,[2220]
    Till he hath found a time to pay us home:[2221]
    And see already how he doth begin[2222]
    To make us strangers to his looks of love.                          290

    _Hot._ He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.

    _Wor._ Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
    Than I by letters shall direct your course.[2223]
    When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,[2223]
    I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;[2224]                    295
    Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
    As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
    To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
    Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

    _North._ Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.          300

    _Hot._ Uncle, adieu: O, let the hours be short[2225]
    Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport! [_Exeunt._[2226]

ACT II.


SCENE I. _Rochester. An inn yard._

         _Enter a_ Carrier _with a lantern in his hand_.[2227]

    _First Car._ Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day,[2228]
    I'll be hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
    yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!

    _Ost._ [_Within_] Anon, anon.[2229]

    _First Car._ I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a                 5
    few flocks in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers[2230]
    out of all cess.

                     _Enter another_ Carrier.[2231]

    _Sec. Car._ Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog,[2232]
    and that is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this[2233]
    house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.[2234]           10

    _First Car._ Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of[2235]
    oats rose; it was the death of him.

    _Sec. Car._ I think this be the most villanous house in[2236]
    all London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.[2237]

    _First Car._ Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a[2237][2238] 15
    king christen could be better bit than I have been since[2239]
    the first cock.

    _Sec. Car._ Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and[2240]
    then we leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds[2241]
    fleas like a loach.                                                  20

    _First Car._ What, ostler! come away and be hanged!
    come away.

    _Sec. Car._ I have a gammon of bacon and two razes of[2242]
    ginger, to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.

    _First Car._ God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are[2243]         25
    quite starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
    never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An 'twere not[2244]
    as good deed as drink, to break the pate on thee, I am a[2245]
    very villain. Come, and be hanged! hast no faith in thee?

                        _Enter_ GADSHILL.[2246]

    _Gads._ Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?                       30

    _First Car._ I think it be two o'clock.

    _Gads._ I prithee, lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
    in the stable.

    _First Car._ Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth[2247]
    two of that, i' faith.[2248]                                         35

    _Gads._ I pray thee, lend me thine.[2249]

    _Sec. Car._ Ay, when? canst tell? Lend me thy lantern,
    quoth he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.[2250]

    _Gads._ Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come
    to London?                                                           40

    _Sec. Car._ Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I
    warrant thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
    gentlemen: they will along with company, for they have
    great charge.                              [_Exeunt Carriers._[2251]

    _Gads._ What, ho! chamberlain![2252]                                 45

    _Cham._ [_Within_] At hand, quoth pick-purse.[2253]

    _Gads._ That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the[2254]
    chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking of
    purses than giving direction doth from labouring; thou
    layest the plot how.[2255]                                           50

                          _Enter_ Chamberlain.

    _Cham._ Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current
    that I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
    wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him
    in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his company last
    night at supper; a kind of auditor; one that hath abundance          55
    of charge too, God knows what. They are up already, and
    call for eggs and butter: they will away presently.

    _Gads._ Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
    clerks, I'll give thee this neck.

    _Cham._ No, I'll none of it: I pray thee, keep that for[2256]        60
    the hangman; for I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas
    as truly as a man of falsehood may.

    _Gads._ What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I
    hang, I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old Sir
    John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no starveling[2257]       65
    Tut! there are other Trojans that thou dreamest
    not of, the which for sport sake are content to do the profession
    some grace; that would, if matters should be looked
    into, for their own credit sake, make all whole. I am joined[2258]
    with no foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,[2259]     70
    none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms; but[2260]
    with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and great
        oneyers,[2261][2262]
    such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than[2262][2263]
    speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than[2263][2264]
    pray: and yet, 'zounds, I lie; for they pray continually to[2265]    75
    their saint, the commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her,[2266][2267]
    but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her and[2267][2268]
    make her their boots.[2268]

    _Cham._ What, the commonwealth their boots? will she
    hold out water in foul way?                                          80

    _Gads._ She will, she will; justice hath liquored her.
    We steal as in a castle, cock-sure; we have the receipt of
    fern-seed, we walk invisible.

    _Cham._ Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding[2269]
    to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.[2270]     85

    _Gads._ Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in
    our purchase, as I am a true man.[2271]

    _Cham._ Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false
    thief.

    _Gads._ Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men.                   90
    Bid the ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,[2272]
    you muddy knave.                                    [_Exeunt._[2273]


SCENE II. _The highway, near Gadshill._

                _Enter_ PRINCE HENRY _and_ POINS.[2274]

    _Poins._ Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's
    horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.

    _Prince._ Stand close.

                        _Enter_ FALSTAFF.[2275]

    _Fal._ Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!

    _Prince._ Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling[2276]        5
    dost thou keep!

    _Fal._ Where's Poins, Hal?[2277]

    _Prince._ He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go
    seek him.[2278]

    _Fal._ I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the[2279]       10
    rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know not[2280]
    where. If I travel but four foot by the squier further afoot,[2281]
    I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt not but to die a fair
    death for all this, if I 'scape hanging for killing that rogue.
    I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two and[2282]       15
    twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the rogue's[2282][2283]
    company. If the rascal have not given me medicines to
    make me love him, I'll be hanged; it could not be else; I
    have drunk medicines. Poins! Hal! a plague upon you[2284]
    both! Bardolph! Peto! I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further.[2285] 20
    An 'twere not as good a deed as drink, to turn true[2286]
    man and to leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that[2287]
    ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven ground
    is threescore and ten miles afoot with me; and the stony-hearted
    villains know it well enough: a plague upon it[2288]                 25
    when thieves cannot be true one to another! [_They whistle._][2289]
    Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you[2290]
    rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!

    _Prince._ Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear
    close to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread of[2291]   30
    travellers.

    _Fal._ Have you any levers to lift me up again, being
    down? 'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot[2292]
    again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer. What a
    plague mean ye to colt me thus?                                      35

    _Prince._ Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.

    _Fal._ I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,
    good king's son.

    _Prince._ Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?[2293]               40

    _Fal._ Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters![2294]
    If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I have not ballads made[2295]
    on you all and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my[2296]
    poison: when a jest is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.[2297]

        _Enter_ GADSHILL, BARDOLPH _and_ PETO _with him_.[2298]

    _Gads._ Stand.                                                       45

    _Fal._ So I do, against my will.

    _Poins._ O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,[2299]
    what news?[2299]

    _Bard._ Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there's[2300]
    money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going to the          50
    king's exchequer.

    _Fal._ You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.[2301]

    _Gads._ There's enough to make us all.[2302]

    _Fal._ To be hanged.

    _Prince._ Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow[2303]        55
    lane; Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape from[2304]
    your encounter, then they light on us.

    _Peto._ How many be there of them?[2305]

    _Gads._ Some eight or ten.

    _Fal._'Zounds, will they not rob us?[2306]                           60

    _Prince._ What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?

    _Fal._ Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;[2307]
    but yet no coward, Hal.

    _Prince._ Well, we leave that to the proof.[2308]

    _Poins._ Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:             65
    when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him. Farewell,[2309]
    and stand fast.

    _Fal._ Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.

    _Prince._ Ned, where are our disguises?

    _Poins._ Here, hard by: stand close.                                 70

                                       [_Exeunt Prince and Poins._[2310]

    _Fal._ Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:[2311]
    every man to his business.

                      _Enter the_ Travellers.[73]

    _First Trav._ Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our[2312][2313][2314]
    horses down the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease[2314]
    our legs.[2314]                                                      75

    _Thieves._ Stand![2314][2315]

    _Travellers._ Jesus bless us![2314][2316]

    _Fal._ Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:[2314]
    ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they hate us[2314][2317]
    youth: down with them; fleece them.[2314]                            80

    _Travellers._ O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever![2314]

    _Fal._ Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No,[2314][2318]
    ye fat chuffs; I would your store were here! On, bacons,[2314]
    on! What, ye knaves! young men must live. You are[2314][2319]
    grandjurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.[2314]                    85

                            [_Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt._

               _Re-enter_ PRINCE HENRY _and_ POINS.[2320]

    _Prince._ The thieves have bound the true men. Now[2321]
    could thou and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London,
    it would be argument for a week, laughter for a
    month and a good jest for ever.

    _Poins._ Stand close; I hear them coming.[2322]                      90

                    _Enter the Thieves again._[2323]

    _Fal._ Come, my masters, let us share, and then to
    horse before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two[2295]
    arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's no more[2324]
    valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.

    _Prince._ Your money!                                                95

    _Poins._ Villains!

  [36.34] [_As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon
  them; they all run away; and Falstaff, after a blow or two, runs
  away too, leaving the booty behind them._[2325]

    _Prince._ Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
    The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear[2326][2327]
    So strongly that they dare not meet each other;[2326]
    Each takes his fellow for an officer.[2326][2328]                   100
    Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,[2326][2329]
    And lards the lean earth as he walks along:[2326]
    Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.[2326]

    _Poins._ How the rogue roar'd!                            [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _Warkworth Castle._[2330]

               _Enter_ HOTSPUR _solus, reading a letter_.

    _Hot._ +'But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented+
    +to be there, in respect of the love I bear your house.'+ He[2331]
    could be contented: why is he not, then? In respect of[2332]
    the love he bears our house: he shows in this, he loves
    his own barn better than he loves our house. Let me                   5
    see some more. +'The purpose you undertake is dangerous;'+--why,
    that's certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
    drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle,
    danger, we pluck this flower, safety. +'The purpose you
        undertake[2333]+
    +is dangerous; the friends you have named uncertain; the time[2334]+ 10
    +itself unsorted; and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise+
    +of so great an opposition.'+ Say you so, say you so? I say
    unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and you
    lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is[2335]
    a good plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant:[2336]   15
    a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation;
    an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited
    rogue is this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot
    and the general course of the action. 'Zounds, an I were[2337]
    now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.           20
    Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself? lord
    Edmund Mortimer, my lord of York, and Owen Glendower?
    is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
    their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next
    month? and are they not some of them set forward already?[2338]      25
    What a pagan rascal is this! an infidel! Ha! you shall[2339]
    see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart, will he to
    the king, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could
    divide myself, and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
    skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him! let[2340]          30
    him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set forward[2341]
    to-night.

                       _Enter_ LADY PERCY.[2342]

    How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.[2343]

    _Lady._ O, my good Lord, why are you thus alone?
    For what offence have I this fortnight been                          35
    A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
    Tell me, sweet lord, what is 't that takes from thee
    Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?
    Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,[2344]
    And start so often when thou sit'st alone?                           40
    Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
    And given my treasures and my rights of thee
    To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
    In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,[2345]
    And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;[2346]                      45
    Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
    Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
    Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,[2347]
    Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,[2348]
    Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,                                   50
    Of prisoners' ransom, and of soldiers slain,[2349]
    And all the currents of a heady fight.[2350]
    Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war[2351]
    And thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep,[2352]
    That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow,[2353]                  55
    Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;[2354]
    And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
    Such as we see when men restrain their breath
    On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?[2355]
    Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,                            60
    And I must know it, else he loves me not.

    _Hot._ What, ho!

                         _Enter_ Servant.[2356]

                    Is Gilliams with the packet gone?

    _Serv._ He is, my lord, an hour ago.[2357]

    _Hot._ Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?[2358]

    _Serv._ One horse, my lord, he brought even now.[2359]               65

    _Hot._ What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?[2360][2361]

    _Serv._ It is, my lord.[2361]

    _Hot._                 That roan shall be my throne.[2362]
    Well, I will back him straight: O esperance![2362][2363]
    Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.[2362][2364] [_Exit Servant._

    _Lady._ But hear you, my lord.                                       70

    _Hot._ What say'st thou, my lady?

    _Lady._ What is it carries you away?

    _Hot._ Why, my horse, my love, my horse.[2365]

    _Lady._ Out, you mad-headed ape![2366]
    A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen[2366]                        75
    As you are toss'd with. In faith,[2366][2367]
    I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.[2366]
    I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir[2366]
    About his title, and hath sent for you[2366]
    To line his enterprize: but if you go,--[2366]                       80

    _Hot._ So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.

    _Lady._ Come, come, you paraquito, answer me[2368]
    Directly unto this question that I ask:[2368][2369]
    In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,[2368][2370]
    An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.[2368][2371]             85

    _Hot._ Away,[2372]
    Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,[2372][2373]
    I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
    To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:[2374]
    We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,                        90
    And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
    What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou have with me?[2375]

    _Lady._ Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?[2376]
    Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
    I will not love myself. Do you not love me?                          95
    Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.[2377]

    _Hot._ Come, wilt thou see me ride?[2378]
    And when I am o' horseback, I will swear[2379]
    I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
    I must not have you henceforth question me                          100
    Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:[2380]
    Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,[2380]
    This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.[2381]
    I know you wise, but yet no farther wise[2382]
    Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,                          105
    But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
    No lady closer; for I well believe[2383]
    Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
    And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.[2384]

    _Lady._ How! so far?[2385]                                          110

    _Hot._ Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:[2386]
    Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
    To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.[2387]
    Will this content you, Kate?

    _Lady._                    It must of force.              [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _The Boar's-Head Tavern, Eastcheap._[2388]

                    _Enter the_ PRINCE, _and_ POINS.

    _Prince._ Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and[2389]
    lend me thy hand to laugh a little.

    _Poins._ Where hast been, Hal?

    _Prince._ With three or four loggerheads amongst three[2390]
    or fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string[2391]     5
    of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash
    of drawers; and can call them all by their christen[2392]
    names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already
    upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales,[2393]
    yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no[2394]      10
    proud Jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle,[2395]
    a good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I am[2396]
    king of England, I shall command all the good lads in
    Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and
    when you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and[2397]         15
    bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient
    in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any
    tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee,[2398]
    Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with
    me in this action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which                 20
    name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar,
    clapped even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one
    that never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
    shillings and sixpence,' and 'You are welcome,' with this[2399]
    shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard[2400]     25
    in the Half-moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive away the[2401]
    time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some[2401]
    by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he
    gave me the sugar; and do thou never leave calling[2402]
    'Francis,' that his tale to me may be nothing but 'Anon.'            30
    Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent.[2403]

    _Poins._ Francis!

    _Prince._ Thou art perfect.

    _Poins._ Francis!                               [_Exit Poins._[2404]

                            _Enter_ FRANCIS.

    _Fran._ Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet,[2405]         35
    Ralph.

    _Prince._ Come hither, Francis.

    _Fran._ My lord?

    _Prince._ How long hast thou to serve, Francis?

    _Fran._ Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--                    40

    _Poins._ [_Within_] Francis![2406]

    _Fran._ Anon, anon, sir.

    _Prince._ Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the[2407]
    clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant[2408]
    as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it a               45
    fair pair of heels and run from it?[2409]

    _Fran._ O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in[2410]
    England, I could find in my heart.[2411]

    _Poins._ [_Within_] Francis![2406]

    _Fran._ Anon, sir.[2412]                                             50

    _Prince._ How old art thou, Francis?

    _Fran._ Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--

    _Poins._ [_Within_] Francis![2406]

    _Fran._ Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.[2413]

    _Prince._ Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar                  55
    thou gavest me, 'twas a pennyworth, was't not?[2414]

    _Fran._ O Lord, I would it had been two![2415]

    _Prince._ I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask
    me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.

    _Poins._ [_Within_] Francis![2406]                                   60

    _Fran._ Anon, anon.

    _Prince._ Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow,
    Francis; or Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis,[2416]
    when thou wilt. But, Francis!

    _Fran._ My lord?                                                     65

    _Prince._ Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
    not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,[2417]
    smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--

    _Fran._ O lord, sir, who do you mean?

    _Prince._ Why, then, your brown bastard is your only                 70
    drink; for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
    will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.[2418]

    _Fran._ What, sir?

    _Poins._ [_Within_] Francis![2406]

    _Prince._ Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them[2419]             75
    call?

       [_Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing
                                                which way to go._[2420]

                            _Enter_ Vintner.

    _Vint._ What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
    calling? Look to the guests within. [_Exit Francis._] My[2421]
    lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door:
    shall I let them in?                                                 80

    _Prince._ Let them alone awhile, and then open the[2422]
    door. [_Exit Vintner._] Poins![2423]

    _Re-enter_ POINS.

    _Poins._ Anon, anon, sir.

    _Prince._ Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are
    at the door: shall we be merry?                                      85

    _Poins._ As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye;
    what cunning match have you made with this jest of the
    drawer? come, what's the issue?

    _Prince._ I am now of all humours that have showed
    themselves humours since the old days of goodman Adam                90
    to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.[2424]

                          _Re-enter_ FRANCIS.

    What's o'clock, Francis?

    _Fran._ Anon, anon, sir.                              [_Exit._[2425]

    _Prince._ That ever this fellow should have fewer
    words than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry        95
    is up-stairs and down-stairs; his eloquence the
    parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
    Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven
    dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says[2426]
    to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.' 'O             100
    my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many hast thou killed to-day?'
    'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers
    'Some fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
    prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned
    brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife. 'Rivo!' says[2427]         105
    the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.

       _Enter_ FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, _and_ PETO; FRANCIS
                     _following with wine_.[2428]

    _Poins._ Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?

    _Fal._ A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance
    too! marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy.
    Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend[2429]    110
    them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards! Give[2430]
    me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant? [_He drinks._[2431]

    _Prince._ Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of[2432]
    butter? pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet
        tale[2432][2433][2434]
    of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.[2434][2435] 115

    _Fal._ You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
    nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man: yet[2436]
    a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it. A[2437]
    villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou
    wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the              120
    face of the earth, then am I a shotten herring. There live
    not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
    them is fat, and grows old: God help the while! a bad
    world, I say. I would I were a weaver; I could sing
    psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.[2438]    125

    _Prince._ How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?

    _Fal._ A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
    kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects
    afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I'll never wear hair on
    my face more. You Prince of Wales!                                  130

    _Prince._ Why, you whoreson round man, what's the[2439]
    matter?

    _Fal._ Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and[2440]
    Poins there?

    _Poins._ 'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward,[2441]        135
    by the Lord, I'll stab thee.[2442]

    _Fal._ I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I
    call thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
    could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough
    in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you         140
    that backing of your friends? A plague upon such backing!
    give me them that will face me. Give me a cup of
    sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day.

    _Prince._ O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
    drunkest last.                                                      145

    _Fal._ All's one for that. [_He drinks._] A plague of all[2443]
    cowards, still say I.

    _Prince._ What's the matter?

    _Fal._ What's the matter! there be four of us here have[2444]
    ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.[2445]                      150

    _Prince._ Where is it, Jack? where is it?

    _Fal._ Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
    poor four of us.[2446]

    _Prince._ What, a hundred, man?

    _Fal._ I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a[2447]       155
    dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by miracle.[2448]
    I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four
    through the hose; my buckler cut through and through;
    my sword hacked like a hand-saw--ecce signum! I never
    dealt better since I was a man: all would not do. A                 160
    plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak
    more or less than truth, they are villains and the sons of
    darkness.

    _Prince._ Speak, sirs; how was it?[2449]

    _Gads._ We four set upon some dozen--[2450][2451]                   165

    _Fal._ Sixteen at least, my lord.

    _Gads._ And bound them.[2450]

    _Peto._ No, no, they were not bound.

    _Fal._ You rogue, they were bound, every man of them;
    or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.[2452]                             170

    _Gads._ As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh[2450][2453]
    men set upon us--

    _Fal._ And unbound the rest, and then come in the[2454]
    other.[2455]

    _Prince._ What, fought you with them all?[2456]                     175

    _Fal._ All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought[2457]
    not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if there were[2458]
    not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I
    no two-legged creature.

    _Prince._ Pray God you have not murdered some of[2459]              180
    them.

    _Fal._ Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered
    two of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in
    buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie,
    spit in my face, call me horse. Thou knowest my old                 185
    ward; here I lay, and thus I bore my point. Four rogues[2460]
    in buckram let drive at me--

    _Prince._ What, four? thou saidst but two even now.

    _Fal._ Four, Hal; I told thee four.

    _Poins._ Ay, ay, he said four.                                      190

    _Fal._ These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust
    at me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven[2461]
    points in my target, thus.[2462]

    _Prince._ Seven? why, there were but four even now.

    _Fal._ In buckram?[2463]                                            195

    _Poins._ Ay, four, in buckram suits.

    _Fal._ Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.

    _Prince._ Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more
    anon.

    _Fal._ Dost thou hear me, Hal?                                      200

    _Prince._ Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.

    _Fal._ Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These
    nine in buckram that I told thee of--

    _Prince._ So, two more already.

    _Fal._ Their points being broken,--                                 205

    _Poins._ Down fell their hose.[2464]

    _Fal._ Began to give me ground: but I followed me[2465]
    close, came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
    the eleven I paid.

    _Prince._ O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out                 210
    of two!

    _Fal._ But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
    knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive at
    me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy
    hand.                                                               215

    _Prince._ These lies are like their father that begets[2466]
    them; gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
    clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson,[2467]
    obscene, greasy tallow-catch,--[2468]

    _Fal._ What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the                 220
    truth the truth?

    _Prince._ Why, how couldst thou know these men in
    Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see
    thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to
    this?                                                               225

    _Poins._ Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.

    _Fal._ What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at[2469]
    the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would not
    tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion!
    if reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no[2470] 230
    man a reason upon compulsion, I.

    _Prince._ I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
    coward, this bed-presser, this horse-back-breaker,[2471]
    this huge hill of flesh,--

    _Fal._ 'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried[2472]       235
    neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O for[2473]
    breath to utter what is like thee! you tailor's-yard, you[2474]
    sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing-tuck,--

    _Prince._ Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again:[2475]
    and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear[2476]    240
    me speak but this.[2477]

    _Poins._ Mark, Jack.

    _Prince._ We two saw you four set on four and bound[2478]
    them, and were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how
    a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on[2479]       245
    you four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize,[2480]
    and have it; yea, and can show it you here in the house:[2481]
    and, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly, with
    as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy and still run and[2482]
    roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to[2483]  250
    hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in
    fight! What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
    thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent
    shame?

    _Poins._ Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou               255
    now?

    _Fal._ By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made[2484]
    ye. Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the[2485]
    heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? why,
    thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but beware
        instinct;[2486]                                                 260
    the lion will not touch the true prince. Instinct is
    a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct. I shall[2487]
    think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for
    a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the
    Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap[2485]       265
    to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants,[2488]
    lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship[2489]
    come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a
    play extempore?[2490]

    _Prince._ Content; and the argument shall be thy                    270
    running away.

    _Fal._ Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!

                         _Enter_ Hostess.[2491]

    _Host._ O Jesu, my lord the prince![2492]

    _Prince._ How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest
    thou to me?                                                         275

    _Host._ Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the[2493]
    court at door would speak with you: he says he comes
    from your father.

    _Prince._ Give him as much as will make him a royal
    man, and send him back again to my mother.                          280

    _Fal._ What manner of man is he?

    _Host._ An old man.

    _Fal._ What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight?
    Shall I give him his answer?

    _Prince._ Prithee, do, Jack.                                        285

    _Fal._ 'Faith, and I'll send him packing.                   [_Exit._

    _Prince._ Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did[2494]
    you, Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you[2495]
    ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince;
    no, fie!                                                            290

    _Bard._ Faith, I ran when I saw others run.

    _Prince._ Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's[2496]
    sword so hacked?

    _Peto._ Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he
    would swear truth out of England but he would make you              295
    believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.

    _Bard._ Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to[2497]
    make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments[2498]
    with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I did
    that I did not this seven year before, I blushed to hear his[2499]  300
    monstrous devices.[2500]

    _Prince._ O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen
    years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since[2501]
    thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword
    on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what instinct               305
    hadst thou for it?

    _Bard._ My lord, do you see these meteors? do you
    behold these exhalations?

    _Prince._ I do.

    _Bard._ What think you they portend?                                310

    _Prince._ Hot livers and cold purses.

    _Bard._ Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.

    _Prince._ No, if rightly taken, halter.

                       _Re-enter_ FALSTAFF.[2502]

    Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone. How now,[2503]
    my sweet creature of bombast! How long is't ago, Jack,[2504]        315
    since thou sawest thine own knee?

    _Fal._ My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal,
    I was not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have crept[2505]
    into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and[2506]
    grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous          320
    news abroad: here was Sir John Bracy from your father;[2507]
    you must to the court in the morning. That same mad[2508]
    fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave
    Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and[2509]
    swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh         325
    hook--what a plague call you him?

    _Poins._ O, Glendower.[2510]

    _Fal._ Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,[2511]
    and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot[2512]
    of Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill[2513]           330
    perpendicular,--

    _Prince._ He that rides at high speed and with his[2514]
    pistol kills a sparrow flying.

    _Fal._ You have hit it.

    _Prince._ So did he never the sparrow.                              335

    _Fal._ Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he[2515]
    will not run.

    _Prince._ Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise
    him so for running!

    _Fal._ O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not[2516]         340
    budge a foot.

    _Prince._ Yes, Jack, upon instinct.

    _Fal._ I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
    and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester
    is stolen away to-night; thy father's beard is turned[2517]         345
    white with the news: you may buy land now as cheap as
    stinking mackerel.

    _Prince._ Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot[2518]
    June and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads[2519]
    as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.[2520]                       350

    _Fal._ By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
    shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal, art not[2521][2522]
    thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the[2522][2523]
    world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend
    Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? art           355
    thou not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at it?[2524]

    _Prince._ Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.[2525]

    _Fal._ Well, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when[2526]
    thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an[2527]
    answer.                                                             360

    _Prince._ Do thou stand for my father, and examine
    me upon the particulars of my life.

    _Fal._ Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
    this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.

    _Prince._ Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy[2528]          365
    golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
    crown for a pitiful bald crown!

    _Fal._ Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of[2529]
    thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
    make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have[2530]          370
    wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it in King
    Cambyses' vein.

    _Prince._ Well, here is my leg.[2531]

    _Fal._ And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.

    _Host._ O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith![2532]            375

    _Fal._ Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.[2533]

    _Host._ O, the father, how he holds his countenance![2534]

    _Fal._ For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;[2535]
    For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.

    _Host._ O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry[2536]      380
    players as ever I see!

    _Fal._ Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
    Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time,
    but also how thou art accompanied: for though the camomile,
    the more it is trodden on the faster it grows, yet[2537]            385
    youth, the more it is wasted the sooner it wears. That thou[2538]
    art my son, I have partly thy mother's word, partly my
    own opinion, but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and[2539]
    a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me.[2540]
    If then thou be son to me, here lies the point; why, being[2541]    390
    son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun[2542]
    of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? a question
    not to be asked. Shall the son of England prove a thief
    and take purses? a question to be asked. There is a thing,
    Harry, which thou hast often heard of and it is known to            395
    many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch, as ancient
    writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou
    keepest: for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink
    but in tears, not in pleasure but in passion, not in words
    only, but in woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man             400
    whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not
    his name.

    _Prince._ What manner of man, an it like your majesty?[2543]

    _Fal._ A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of[2544]
    a cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage;          405
    and, as I think, his age some fifty, or, by'r lady, inclining to
    three score; and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff:
    if that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for,[2545]
    Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be[2546]
    known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,[2546]           410
    peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff: him keep
    with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty[2547]
    varlet, tell me, where hast thou been this month?

    _Prince._ Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand
    for me, and I'll play my father.                                    415

    _Fal._ Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so[2548]
    majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by the[2549]
    heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.[2550]

    _Prince._ Well, here I am set.

    _Fal._ And here I stand: judge, my masters.                         420

    _Prince._ Now, Harry, whence come you?

    _Fal._ My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

    _Prince._ The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.

    _Fal._ 'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle ye[2551]
    for a young prince, i' faith.[2552]                                 425

    _Prince._ Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth
    ne'er look on me. Thou art violently carried away from
    grace: there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old[2553]
    fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou[2553]
    converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of[2554]    430
    beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard
    of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted
    Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that[2555]
    reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that[2556]
    vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack              435
    and drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon
    and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft? wherein crafty,
    but in villany? wherein villanous, but in all things? wherein
    worthy, but in nothing?

    _Fal._ I would your grace would take me with you:                   440
    whom means your grace?

    _Prince._ That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
    Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.[2557]

    _Fal._ My lord, the man I know.

    _Prince._ I know thou dost.                                         445

    _Fal._ But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
    were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
    more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but that he is,[2558]
    saving your reverence, a whoremaster, that I utterly deny.
    If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked! if to be[2559]   450
    old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know
    is damned: if to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean
    kine are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
    banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack Falstaff,
    kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff,      455
    and therefore more valiant, being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff,
    banish not him thy Harry's company, banish not him[2560]
    thy Harry's company: banish plump Jack, and banish all
    the world.

    _Prince._ I do, I will.                 [_A knocking-heard._[2561]  460

                               [_Exeunt Hostess, Francis, and Bardolph._

                 _Re-enter_ BARDOLPH, _running_.[2562]

    _Bard._ O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most[2563]
    monstrous watch is at the door.[2564]

    _Fal._ Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much[2565]
    to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

                     _Re-enter the_ Hostess.[2566]

    _Host._ O Jesu, my lord, my lord!--[2567]                           465

    _Prince._ Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a[2568]
    fiddlestick: what's the matter?

    _Host._ The sheriff and all the watch are at the door:
    they are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?

    _Fal._ Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of gold[2569]   470
    a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad, without seeming so.[2570]

    _Prince._ And thou a natural coward, without instinct.[2571]

    _Fal._ I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff, so;
    if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart as well as another
    man, a plague on my bringing up! I hope I shall as                  475
    soon be strangled with a halter as another.

    _Prince._ Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk
    up above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good[2572]
    conscience.

    _Fal._ Both which I have had: but their date is out, and            480
    therefore I'll hide me.

    _Prince._ Call in the sheriff.

                               [_Exeunt all except the Prince and Peto._

                _Enter_ Sheriff _and the_ Carrier.[2573]

    Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?[2574]

    _Sher._ First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry[2575]
    Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.[2575]                    485

    _Prince._ What men?

    _Sher._ One of them is well known, my gracious lord,[2575][2576]
    A gross fat man.[2575][2577]

    _Car._           As fat as butter.

    _Prince._ The man, I do assure you, is not here;
    For I myself at this time have employ'd him.                        490
    And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee[2578]
    That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
    Send him to answer thee, or any man,
    For any thing he shall be charged withal:
    And so let me entreat you leave the house.                          495

    _Sher._ I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
    Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.[2579]

    _Prince._ It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
    He shall be answerable; and so farewell.

    _Sher._ Good night, my noble lord.                                  500

    _Prince._ I think it is good morrow, is it not?

    _Sher._ Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.

                                    [_Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier._[2580]

    _Prince._ This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's.
    Go, call him forth.

    _Peto._ Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and[2581]          505
    snorting like a horse.

    _Prince._ Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search[2582]
    his pockets. [_He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain[2583]
    papers._] What hast thou found?

    _Peto._ Nothing but papers, my lord.[2581]                          510

    _Prince._ Let's see what they be: read them.[2584]

    _Peto._ [reads] +Item, A capon,                 2s. 2d.+[2585]
                    +Item, Sauce,                       4d.+
                    +Item, Sack, two gallons,       5s. 8d.+
                    +Item, Anchovies and sack after
                                            supper, 2s. 6d.+[2586]      515
                    +Item, Bread,                       ob.+[2587]

    _Prince._ O monstrous! but one half-pennyworth of bread
    to this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else, keep
    close; we'll read it at more advantage: there let him sleep
    till day. I'll to the court in the morning. We must all to          520
    the wars, and thy place shall be honourable. I'll procure
    this fat rogue a charge of foot; and I know his death will
    be a march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid back[2588]
    again with advantage. Be with me betimes in the morning;
    and so, good morrow, Peto.[2589]              [_Exeunt._            525

    _Peto._ Good morrow, good my lord.[2581]

ACT III.


SCENE I. _Bangor. The Archdeacon's house._

      _Enter_ HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, _and_ GLENDOWER.[2590]

    _Mort._ These promises are fair, the parties sure,
    And our induction full of prosperous hope.

    _Hot._ Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,[2591]
    Will you sit down?[2591]
    And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it![2591]                          5
    I have forgot the map.[2591][2592]

    _Glend._                 No, here it is.[2592]
    Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,[2592]
    For by that name as oft as Lancaster[2592][2593]
    Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with[2592][2594]
    A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.[2592][2595]                  10

    _Hot._ And you in hell, as oft as lie hears Owen[2596][2597]
    Glendower spoke of.[2596]

    _Glend._ I cannot blame him: at my nativity[2598]
    The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
    Of burning cressets; and at my birth[2599][2600]                     15
    The frame and huge foundation of the earth[2599][2601]
    Shaked like a coward.[2599][2602]

    _Hot._ Why, so it would have done at the same season,[2603][2604]
    if your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself had[2603][2605]
    never been born.[2603][2606]                                         20

    _Glend._ I say the earth did shake when I was born.

    _Hot._ And I say the earth was not of my mind,[2607]
    If you suppose as fearing you it shook.

    _Glend._ The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.

    _Hot._ O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,[2608]     25
    And not in fear of your nativity.
    Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
    In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth[2609]
    Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
    By the imprisoning of unruly wind                                    30
    Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
    Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down[2610]
    Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth[2611]
    Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,[2612]
    In passion shook.

    _Glend._          Cousin, of many men                                35
    I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave[2613]
    To tell you once again that at my birth
    The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
    The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
    Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.[2614]               40
    These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
    And all the courses of my life do show
    I am not in the roll of common men.[2615]
    Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea[2616]
    That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,[2617]             45
    Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
    And bring him out that is but woman's son[2618]
    Can trace me in the tedious ways of art[2619]
    And hold me pace in deep experiments.[2620]

    _Hot._ I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.[2621][2622]       50
    I'll to dinner.[2621][2623]

    _Mort._ Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.[2624]

    _Glend._ I can call spirits from the vasty deep.

    _Hot._ Why, so can I, or so can any man;
    But will they come when you do call for them?                        55

    _Glend._ Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command[2625][2626]
    The devil.[2626]

    _Hot._ And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil[2627]
    By telling truth: tell truth, and shame the devil.[2628]
    If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,                   60
    And I 'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
    O, while you live, tell truth, and shame the devil!

    _Mort._ Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.[2629]

    _Glend._ Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
    Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye[2630]                 65
    And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him[2631][2632]
    Bootless home and weather-beaten back.[2632][2633]

    _Hot._ Home without boots, and in foul weather too![2634]
    How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?[2635]

    _Glend._ Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right[2636]       70
    According to our threefold order ta'en?

    _Mort._ The archdeacon hath divided it[2637]
    Into three limits very equally:
    England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
    By south and east is to my part assign'd:                            75
    All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore.
    And all the fertile land within that bound.
    To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you[2638]
    The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
    And our indentures tripartite are drawn;[2639]                       80
    Which being sealed interchangeably,
    A business that this night may execute,
    To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I[2640]
    And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
    To meet your father and the Scottish power,                          85
    As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
    My father Glendower is not ready yet,
    Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.
    Within that space you may have drawn together[2641]
    Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen.                   90

    _Glend._ A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
    And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
    From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
    For there will be a world of water shed[2642]
    Upon the parting of your wives and you.                              95

    _Hot._ Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,[2643]
    In quantity equals not one of yours:
    See how this river comes me cranking in,[2644]
    And cuts me from the best of all my land
    A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.[2645]                     100
    I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;[2646]
    And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
    In a new channel, fair and evenly;
    It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
    To rob me of so rich a bottom here.                                 105

    _Glend._ Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.

    _Mort._ Yea, but[2647][2648]
    Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up[2647][2648]
    With like advantage on the other side;[2647]
    Gelding the opposed continent as much[2647]                         110
    As on the other side it takes from you.[2647]

    _Wor._ Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
    And on this north side win this cape of land;
    And then he runs straight and even.[2649]

    _Hot._ I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.                 115

    _Glend._ I'll not have it alter'd.[2650]

    _Hot._                             Will not you?

    _Glend._ No, nor you shall not.

    _Hot._                          Who shall say me nay?

    _Glend._ Why, that will I.

    _Hot._ Let me not understand you, then; speak it in[2651][2652]
    Welsh.[2651]                                                        120

    _Glend._ I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
    For I was train'd up in the English court;
    Where, being but young, I framed to the harp[2653]
    Many an English ditty lovely well
    And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,                             125
    A virtue that was never seen in you.

    _Hot._ Marry,[2654]
    And I am glad of it with all my heart:[2654]
    I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
    Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;[2655]                  130
    I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,[2656]
    Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
    And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,[2657]
    Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
    'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.                       135

    _Glend._ Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.

    _Hot._ I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land[2658]
    To any well-deserving friend;[2658][2659]
    But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
    I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.                             140
    Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?

    _Glend._ The moon shines fair; you may away by night:[2660]
    I'll haste the writer, and withal[2661][2662]
    Break with your wives of your departure hence:[2662]
    I am afraid my daughter will run mad,                               145
    So much she doteth on her Mortimer.                         [_Exit._

    _Mort._ Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father![2663]

    _Hot._ I cannot choose: sometime he angers me[2664]
    With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,[2665]
    Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,[2666]                     150
    And of a dragon and a finless fish,
    A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,[2667]
    A couching lion and a ramping cat,[2668]
    And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
    As puts me from my faith. I tell you what,--                        155
    He held me last night at least nine hours[2669]
    In reckoning up the several devils' names
    That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'[2670]
    But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious[2671]
    As a tired horse, a railing wife;[2672]                             160
    Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
    With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
    Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
    In any summer-house in Christendom.

    _Mort._ In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,[2673]                   165
    Exceedingly well read, and profited[2674]
    In strange concealments, valiant as a lion[2675]
    And wondrous affable and as bountiful[2675][2676]
    As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?[2675][2677]
    He holds your temper in a high respect[2675]                        170
    And curbs himself even of his natural scope[2678]
    When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:[2679]
    I warrant you, that man is not alive
    Might so have tempted him as you have done,
    Without the taste of danger and reproof:                            175
    But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.

    _Wor._ In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;[2680]
    And since your coming hither have done enough
    To put him quite beside his patience.[2681]
    You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:                    180
    Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--[2682]
    And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
    Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
    Defect of manners, want of government,
    Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:                            185
    The least of which haunting a nobleman[2683]
    Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain[2684]
    Upon the beauty of all parts besides,[2685]
    Beguiling them of commendation.

    _Hot._ Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed![2686]       190
    Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.

             _Re-enter_ GLENDOWER _with the_ ladies.[2687]

    _Mort._ This is the deadly spite that angers me;[2688]
    My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.

    _Glend._ My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;[2689]
    She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.                        195

    _Mort._ Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy[2690]
    Shall follow in your conduct speedily.

                            [_Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she
                                        answers him in the same._[2691]

    _Glend._ She is desperate here; a peevish self-will'd
        harlotry,[2692][2693]
    one that no persuasion can do good upon.[2693][2694]

                                            [_The lady speaks in Welsh._

    _Mort._ I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh                   200
    Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens[2695]
    I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
    In such a parley should I answer thee.

                                [_The lady speaks again in Welsh._[2696]

    I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
    And that's a feeling disputation:[2697]                             205
    But I will never be a truant, love,
    Till I have learn'd thy language; for thy tongue
    Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,[2698]
    Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
    With ravishing division, to her lute.                               210

    _Glend._ Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.[2699]

                                      [_The lady speaks again in Welsh._

    _Mort._ O, I am ignorance itself in this!

    _Glend._ She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down[2700]
    And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
    And she will sing the song that pleaseth you                        215
    And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,
    Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
    Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep[2701]
    As is the difference betwixt day and night
    The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team                         220
    Begins his golden progress in the east.[2702]

    _Mort._ With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
    By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.

    _Glend._ Do so;
    And those musicians that shall play to you[2703]                    225
    Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,[2704]
    And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.[2705]

    _Hot._ Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down:[2706]
    come, quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.[2706]

    _Lady P._ Go, ye giddy goose.                                       230

                                               [_The music plays._[2707]

    _Hot._ Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;[2708]
    And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.[2708]
    By'r lady, he is a good musician.[2708]

    _Lady P._ Then should you be nothing but musical, for[2708][2709]
    you are altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye[2708][2710]   235
    thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh.[2708]

    _Hot._ I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.[2711]

    _Lady P._ Wouldst thou have thy head broken?[2712]

    _Hot._ No.

    _Lady P._ Then be still.                                            240

    _Hot._ Neither; 'tis a woman's fault.

    _Lady P._ Now God help thee!

    _Hot._ To the Welsh lady's bed.

    _Lady P._ What's that?

    _Hot._ Peace! she sings.                                            245

                                    [_Here the lady sings a Welsh song._

    _Hot._ Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.[2713]

    _Lady P._ Not mine, in good sooth.

    _Hot._ Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear[2714][2715]
    like a comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and[2716]
    'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and 'as[2717]      250
    sure as day,'[2714]
    And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
    As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.[2718]
    Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
    A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'                    255
    And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,[2719]
    To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
    Come, sing.

    _Lady P._ I will not sing.

    _Hot._ 'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast[2720]     260
    teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away within these[2721]
    two hours; and so, come in when ye will.[2722]      [_Exit._

    _Glend._ Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow[2723]
    As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.[2724]
    By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,[2725]                    265
    And then to horse immediately.[2725]

    _Mort._                        With all my heart.         [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _London. The palace._[2726]

            _Enter the_ KING, PRINCE of WALES, _and others_.

    _King._ Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I[2727]
    Must have some private conference: but be near at hand,[2727][2728]
    For we shall presently have need of you.            [_Exeunt Lords._
    I know not whether God will have it so,[2729]
    For some displeasing service I have done,                             5
    That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
    He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
    But thou dost in thy passages of life[2730]
    Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
    For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven                          10
    To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
    Could such inordinate and low desires,
    Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,[2731]
    Such barren pleasures, rude society,
    As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,[2732]                     15
    Accompany the greatness of thy blood
    And hold their level with thy princely heart?

    _Prince._ So please your majesty, I would I could[2733]
    Quit all offences with as clear excuse
    As well as I am doubtless I can purge                                20
    Myself of many I am charged withal:
    Yet such extenuation let me beg,
    As, in reproof of many tales devised,[2734]
    Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
    By smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers,                         25
    I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
    Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
    Find pardon on my true submission.

    _King._ God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,[2735]
    At thy affections, which do hold a wing                              30
    Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
    Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost,
    Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
    And art almost an alien to the hearts
    Of all the court and princes of my blood:                            35
    The hope and expectation of thy time
    Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
    Prophetically do forethink thy fall.[2736]
    Had I so lavish of my presence been,
    So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,                              40
    So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
    Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
    Had still kept loyal to possession
    And left me in reputeless banishment,
    A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.                                  45
    By being seldom seen, I could not stir[2737]
    But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
    That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
    Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
    And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,                           50
    And dress'd myself in such humility
    That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
    Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
    Even in the presence of the crowned king.[2738]
    Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;[2739]                       55
    My presence, like a robe pontifical,
    Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
    Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
    And wan by rareness such solemnity.[2740]
    The skipping king, he ambled up and down                             60
    With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,[2741]
    Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,[2742]
    Mingled his royalty with capering fools,[2743]
    Had his great name profaned with their scorns
    And gave his countenance, against his name,                          65
    To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push[2744]
    Of every beardless vain comparative,
    Grew a companion to the common streets,
    Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;[2745]
    That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,                           70
    They surfeited with honey and began[2746]
    To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little[2746][2747]
    More than a little is by much too much.
    So when he had occasion to be seen,
    He was but as the cuckoo is in June,                                 75
    Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
    As, sick and blunted with community,
    Afford no extraordinary gaze,[2748]
    Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
    When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;                              80
    But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,[2749]
    Slept in his face and render'd such aspect[2750]
    As cloudy men use to their adversaries,[2751]
    Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
    And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;[2752]                   85
    For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
    With vile participation: not an eye
    But is a-weary of thy common sight,
    Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
    Which now doth that I would not have it do,[2753]                    90
    Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

    _Prince._ I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
    Be more myself.

    _King._         For all the world[2754]
    As thou art to this hour was Richard then[2755]
    When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,[2756]                    95
    And even as I was then is Percy now.
    Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
    He hath more worthy interest to the state[2757]
    Than thou the shadow of succession;[2758]
    For of no right, nor colour like to right,                          100
    He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
    Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
    And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
    Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on[2759]
    To bloody battles and to bruising arms.                             105
    What never-dying honour hath he got
    Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,[2760]
    Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
    Holds from all soldiers chief majority[2761]
    And military title capital                                          110
    Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
    Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,[2762]
    This infant warrior, in his enterprizes
    Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,[2763]
    Enlarged him and made a friend of him,                              115
    To fill the mouth of deep defiance up[2764]
    And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
    And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
    The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,[2765]
    Capitulate against us and are up.                                   120
    But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
    Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
    Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?[2766]
    Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,[2767]
    Base inclination and the start of spleen,                           125
    To fight against me under Percy's pay,
    To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
    o show how much thou art degenerate.[2768]

    _Prince._ Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
    And God forgive them that so much have sway'd[2769]                 130
    Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
    I will redeem all this on Percy's head
    And in the closing of some glorious day
    Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
    When I will wear a garment all of blood                             135
    And stain my favours in a bloody mask,[2770]
    Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
    And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
    That this same child of honour and renown,
    This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,                      140
    And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
    For every honour sitting on his helm,[2771]
    Would they were multitudes, and on my head[2772]
    My shames redoubled! for the time will come,[2773]
    That I shall make this northern youth exchange                      145
    His glorious deeds for my indignities.
    Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
    To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;[2774]
    And I will call him to so strict account,
    That he shall render every glory up,                                150
    Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,[2775]
    Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
    This, in the name of God, I promise here:[2776]
    The which if He be pleased I shall perform,[2777]
    I do beseech your majesty may salve                                 155
    The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:[2778]
    If not, the end of life cancels all bands;[2779]
    And I will die a hundred thousand deaths[2780]
    Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

    _King._ A hundred thousand rebels die in this:                      160
    Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.

                          _Enter_ BLUNT.[2781]

    How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.[2782]

    _Blunt._ So hath the business that I come to speak of.[2783]
    Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
    That Douglas and the English rebels met                             165
    The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury:
    A mighty and a fearful head they are,
    If promises be kept on every hand,
    As ever offer'd foul play in a state.

    _King._ The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;[2784]            170
    With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
    For this advertisement is five days old:
    On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;[2785]
    On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting[2786]
    Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march[2786][2787]             175
    Through Gloucestershire; by which account,[2786][2788]
    Our business valued, some twelve days hence[2788]
    Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
    Our hands are full of business: let's away;
    Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.[2789]      [_Exeunt._     180


SCENE III. _Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern._[2790]

                    _Enter_ FALSTAFF _and_ BARDOLPH.

    _Fal._ Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this
    last action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why, my skin
    hangs about me like an old lady's loose gown; I am withered
    like an old apple-john. Well, I'll repent, and that suddenly,
    while I am in some liking; I shall be out of heart                    5
    shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. An[2791]
    I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of,
    I am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a church!
    Company, villanous company, hath been the spoil of me.

    _Bard._ Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.          10

    _Fal._ Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song;
    make me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman[2792]
    need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not above
    seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house not above once[2793]
    in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I borrowed,[2794]          15
    three or four times; lived well, and in good compass: and
    now I live out of all order, out of all compass.[2795]

    _Bard._ Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must
    needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass,
    Sir John.                                                            20

    _Fal._ Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:[2796]
    thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop,[2797]
    but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the Knight of the[2798]
    Burning Lamp.

    _Bard._ Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.[2799]               25

    _Fal._ No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as
    many a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori:
    I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire, and Dives that
    lived in purple; for there he is in his robes, burning,[2800]
    burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would swear[2801]   30
    by thy face; my oath should be, 'By this fire, that's God's[2802]
    angel:' but thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed,[2802]
    but for the light in thy face, the son of utter darkness.[2803]
    When thou rannest up Gadshill in the night to catch my[2804]
    horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus[2805]      35
    or a ball of wildfire, there's no purchase in money. O, thou
    art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light! Thou[2806]
    hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches,
    walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern:
    but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me            40
    lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler's in Europe.[2807]
    I have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any[2808]
    time this two and thirty years; God reward me for it![2809]

    _Bard._ 'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly![2810]

    _Fal._ God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heartburned.[2811]     45

                         _Enter_ HOSTESS.[2812]

    How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired yet
    who picked my pocket?

    _Host._ Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do
    you think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched, I             50
    have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy by
    boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair was never lost[2813]
    in my house before.

    _Fal._ Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved, and lost
    many a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked.[2814]           55
    Go to, you are a woman, go.[2815]

    _Host._ Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was[2816]
    never called so in mine own house before.

    _Fal._ Go to, I know you well enough.

    _Host._ No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John.                  60
    I know you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and
    now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought you a
    dozen of shirts to your back.

    _Fal._ Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
    bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.[2817]             65

    _Host._ Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight[2818]
    shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir John,[2818]
    for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent you, four[2819][2820]
    and twenty pound.[2820][2821]

    _Fal._ He had his part of it; let him pay.                           70

    _Host._ He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.

    _Fal._ How! poor? look upon his face; what call you
    rich? let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks: I'll[2822]
    not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker of me?
    shall I not take mine ease in mine inn but I shall have my           75
    pocket picked? I have lost a seal-ring of my grandfather's
    worth forty mark.

    _Host._ O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know[2823]
    not how oft, that that ring was copper![2824]

    _Fal._ How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood,[2825]        80
    an he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he would[2826]
    say so.

  _Enter the_ PRINCE _and_ PETO, _marching, and_ FALSTAFF _meets them
             playing on his truncheon like a fife_.[2827]

    How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith? must we[2828][2829]
    all march?[2829]

    _Bard._ Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.[2830]                     85

    _Host._ My lord, I pray you, hear me.

    _Prince._ What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How
    doth thy husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.[2831]

    _Host._ Good my lord, hear me.

    _Fal._ Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.                       90

    _Prince._ What sayest thou, Jack?

    _Fal._ The other night I fell asleep here behind the
    arras, and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
    bawdy-house; they pick pockets.

    _Prince._ What didst thou lose, Jack?                                95

    _Fal._ Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds
    of forty pound a-piece, and a seal-ring of my grandfather's.[2832]

    _Prince._ A trifle, some eight-penny matter.

    _Host._ So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard
    your grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely of           100
    you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said he would[2833]
    cudgel you.

    _Prince._ What! he did not?

    _Host._ There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in
    me else.                                                            105

    _Fal._ There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed[2834]
    prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox; and[2835]
    for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the deputy's wife of
    the ward to thee. Go, you thing, go.[2836]

    _Host._ Say, what thing? what thing?                                110

    _Fal._ What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.[2837]

    _Host._ I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou[2837][2838]
    shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and, setting
    thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.

    _Fal._ Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast                115
    to say otherwise.

    _Host._ Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?

    _Fal._ What beast! why, an otter.

    _Prince._ An otter, Sir John! why an otter?

    _Fal._ Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows               120
    not where to have her.

    _Host._ Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or[2839]
    any man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!

    _Prince._ Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders
    thee most grossly.                                                  125

    _Host._ So he doth you, my lord; and said this other
    day you ought him a thousand pound.[2840]

    _Prince._ Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?

    _Fal._ A thousand pound, Hal! a million: thy love is
    worth a million: thou owest me thy love.                            130

    _Host._ Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he
    would cudgel you.

    _Fal._ Did I, Bardolph?

    _Bard._ Indeed, Sir John, you said so.

    _Fal._ Yea, if he said my ring was copper.                          135

    _Prince._ I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as
    thy word now?

    _Fal._ Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I[2841]
    dare: but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring[2842]
    of the lion's whelp.                                                140

    _Prince._ And why not as the lion?

    _Fal._ The king himself is to be feared as the lion: dost
    thou think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an I do,[2843]
    I pray God my girdle break.[2844]

    _Prince._ O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about            145
    thy knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith, truth,
    nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all filled up with[2845]
    guts and midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking[2846]
    thy pocket! why, thou whoreson, impudent, embossed
    rascal, if there were anything in thy pocket but                    150
    tavern-reckonings, memorandums of bawdy-houses, and one poor
    penny-worth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if
    thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but
    these, I am a villain: and yet you will stand to it; you will
    not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?                          155

    _Fal._ Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state
    of innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack Falstaff[2847]
    do in the days of villany? Thou seest I have more
    flesh than another man; and therefore more frailty. You
    confess then, you picked my pocket?                                 160

    _Prince._ It appears so by the story.

    _Fal._ Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;[2848]
    love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy[2848][2849]
    guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason:[2848][2850]
    thou seest I am pacified still. Nay, prithee, be gone.[2848][2851]  165
    [_Exit Hostess._] Now, Hal, to the news at court: for the[2852]
    robbery, lad, how is that answered?

    _Prince._ O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel[2853][2854]
    to thee: the money is paid back again.[2853]

    _Fal._ O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double             170
    labour.

    _Prince._ I am good friends with my father, and may
    do any thing.

    _Fal._ Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest,
    and do it with unwashed hands too.                                  175

    _Bard._ Do, my lord.

    _Prince._ I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.

    _Fal._ I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
    one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the age of[2855]
    two and twenty or thereabouts! I am heinously[2856]                 180
    unprovided. Well, God be thanked for these rebels, they offend[2857]
    none but the virtuous: I laud them, I praise them.

    _Prince._ Bardolph!

    _Bard._ My lord?

    _Prince._ Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,[2858]      185
    to my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.[2858][2859]
    [_Exit Bardolph._] Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou
        and[2858][2860]
    I have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time. [_Exit
        Peto._][2858][2861]
    Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two o'clock[2858]
    in the afternoon.[2858][2862]                                       190
    There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive[2863]
    Money and order for their furniture.[2863]
    The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
    And either we or they must lower lie.                 [_Exit._[2864]

    _Fal._ Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come![2865]  195
    O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!             [_Exit._[2866]

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _The Rebel Camp near Shrewsbury._

            _Enter_ HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, _and_ DOUGLAS.[2867]

    _Hot._ Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth[2868]
    In this fine age were not thought flattery,[2869]
    Such attribution should the Douglas have,
    As not a soldier of this season's stamp
    Should go so general current through the world.                       5
    By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy[2870]
    The tongues of soothers; but a braver place[2871]
    In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
    Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.

    _Doug._ Thou art the king of honour:[2872]                           10
    No man so potent breathes upon the ground[2873]
    But I will beard him.[2873]

    _Hot._                Do so, and 'tis well.[2874][2875]

            _Enter a_ Messenger _with letters_.[2875][2876]

    What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.[2875][2877]

    _Mess._ These letters come from your father.[2878]

    _Hot._ Letters from him! why comes he not himself?[2879]             15

    _Mess._ He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.[2879][2880]

    _Hot._ 'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick[2881]
    In such a justling time? Who leads his power?
    Under whose government come they along?

    _Mess._ His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.[2882]             20

    _Wor._ I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?

    _Mess._ He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
    And at the time of my departure thence
    He was much fear'd by his physicians.[2883]

    _Wor._ I would the state of time had first been whole[2884]          25
    Ere he by sickness had been visited:
    His health was never better worth than now.

    _Hot._ Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
    The very life-blood of our enterprise;
    'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.                              30
    He writes me here, that inward sickness--[2885]
    And that his friends by deputation could not[2886]
    So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet[2886]
    To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
    On any soul removed but on his own.                                  35
    Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
    That with our small conjunction we should on,
    To see how fortune is disposed to us;
    For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,
    Because the king is certainly possess'd                              40
    Of all our purposes. What say you to it?

    _Wor._ Your father's sickness is a maim to us.

    _Hot._ A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:
    And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want[2887]
    Seems more than we shall find it: were it good[2888]                 45
    To set the exact wealth of all our states[2888][2889]
    All at one cast? to set so rich a main[2889][2890]
    On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?[2891]
    It were not good; for therein should we read[2892][2893]
    The very bottom and the soul of hope,[2893][2894]                    50
    The very list, the very utmost bound
    Of all our fortunes.[2895]

    _Doug._              Faith, and so we should;[2895][2896]
    Where now remains a sweet reversion:[2895]
    We may boldly spend upon the hope of what[2895][2897][2898]
    Is to come in:[2895][2898]                                           55
    A comfort of retirement lives in this.[2899]

    _Hot._ A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,
    If that the devil and mischance look big
    Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.

    _Wor._ But yet I would your father had been here.                    60
    The quality and hair of our attempt[2900]
    Brooks no division: it will be thought[2901]
    By some, that know not why he is away,
    That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
    Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:                         65
    And think how such an apprehension
    May turn the tide of fearful faction
    And breed a kind of question in our cause;
    For well you know we of the offering side[2902]
    Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,                             70
    And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
    The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
    This absence of your father's draws a curtain,[2903]
    That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
    Before not dreamt of.

    _Hot._                You strain too far.[2904]                      75
    I rather of his absence make this use:
    It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
    A larger dare to our great enterprise,[2905]
    Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
    If we without his help can make a head                               80
    To push against a kingdom, with his help[2906]
    We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.[2907]
    Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.

    _Doug._ As heart can think: there is not such a word[2908]
    Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.[2908][2909]               85

                      _Enter_ SIR RICHARD VERNON.

    _Hot._ My cousin Vernon! welcome, by my soul.[2910]

    _Ver._ Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
    The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
    Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.[2911]

    _Hot._ No harm: what more?

    _Ver._                     And further, I have                       90
    The king himself in person is set forth,[2912]
    Or hitherwards intended speedily,[2913]
    With strong and mighty preparation.

    _Hot._ He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,[2914]
    The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,[2915]                      95
    And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,[2916]
    And bid it pass?

    _Ver._           All furnish'd, all in arms;[2917]
    All plumed like estridges that with the wind[2918][2919]
    Baited like eagles having lately bathed;[2919][2920]
    Glittering in golden coats, like images;                            100
    As full of spirit as the month of May,
    And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
    Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.[2921]
    I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,[2922]
    His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd,[2923]                   105
    Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
    And vaulted with such ease into his seat,[2924]
    As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,[2925]
    To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
    And witch the world with noble horsemanship.                        110

    _Hot._ No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,[2926]
    This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come;
    They come like sacrifices in their trim,
    And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
    All hot and bleeding will we offer them:                            115
    The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit[2927]
    Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
    To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
    And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,[2928]
    Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt                                120
    Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
    Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,[2929]
    Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
    O that Glendower were come!

    _Ver._                      There is more news:
    I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,                            125
    He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.[2930]

    _Doug._ That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.[2931]

    _Wor._ Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.

    _Hot._ What may the king's whole battle reach unto?

    _Ver._ To thirty thousand.

    _Hot._                Forty let it be:                              130
    My father and Glendower being both away,
    The powers of us may serve so great a day.[2932]
    Come, let us take a muster speedily:[2933]
    Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.

    _Doug._ Talk not of dying: I am out of fear                         135
    Of death or death's hand for this one half-year.    [_Exeunt._[2934]


SCENE II. _A public road near Coventry._[2935]

                    _Enter_ FALSTAFF _and_ BARDOLPH.

    _Fal._ Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
    bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through; we'll to
    Sutton Co'fil' to-night.[2936]

    _Bard._ Will you give me money, captain?

    _Fal._ Lay out, lay out.                                              5

    _Bard._ This bottle makes an angel.

    _Fal._ An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it[2937]
    make twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
    my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.[2938]

    _Bard._ I will, captain: farewell.                         [_Exit._  10

    _Fal._ If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused[2939]
    gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably. I have
    got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred[2940]
    and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders,[2941]
    yeoman's sons; inquire me out contracted bachelors,[2941]            15
    such as had been asked twice on the banns; such a[2942]
    commodity of warm slaves, as had as lieve hear the devil
    as a drum; such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a[2943]
    struck fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but[2944]
    such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger       20
    than pins'-heads, and they have bought out their services;[2945]
    and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals,
    lieutenants, gentlemen of companies, slaves as ragged as
    Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked[2946]
    his sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but               25
    discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to younger
    brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers trade-fallen, the cankers[2947]
    of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more[2948]
    dishonourable ragged than an old faced ancient: and such have I,
        to[2949]
    fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their[2950]           30
    services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty[2951]
    tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from[2952]
    eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way
    and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed
    the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I'll              35
    not march through Coventry with them, that's flat: nay,[2953]
    and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had[2954]
    gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of prison.
    There's but a shirt and a half in all my company; and the[2955]
    half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over            40
    the shoulders like an herald's coat without sleeves; and the
    shirt, to say the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's,[2956]
    or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all one;[2957]
    they'll find linen enough on every hedge.

              _Enter the_ PRINCE _and_ WESTMORELAND.[2958]

    _Prince._ How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!                       45

    _Fal._ What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil
    dost thou in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland,
    I cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already
    been at Shrewsbury.

    _West._ Faith, Sir John, 'tis more than time that I were             50
    there, and you too; but my powers are there already. The
    king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must away all night.[2959]

    _Fal._ Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to[2960]
    steal cream.

    _Prince._ I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft              55
    hath already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
    fellows are these that come after?

    _Fal._ Mine, Hal, mine.

    _Prince._ I did never see such pitiful rascals.

    _Fal._ Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder,               60
    food for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better: tush,[2961]
    man, mortal men, mortal men.

    _West._ Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding
    poor and bare, too beggarly.

    _Fal._ Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they               65
    had that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
    learned that of me.

    _Prince._ No, I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers
    on the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is already[2962]
    in the field.                                                        70

    _Fal._ What, is the king encamped?

    _West._ He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.[2963]

    _Fal._ Well,[2964]
    To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast[2965]
    Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.[2964]      [_Exeunt._          75


SCENE III. _The Rebel Camp near Shrewsbury._[2966]

           _Enter_ HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, _and_ VERNON.

    _Hot._ We'll fight with him to-night.

    _Wor._                                It may not be.

    _Doug._ You give him then advantage.

    _Ver._                               Not a whit.

    _Hot._ Why say you so? looks he not for supply?

    _Ver._ So do we.

    _Hot._           His is certain, ours is doubtful.[2967]

    _Wor._ Good cousin, be advised; stir not to-night.                    5

    _Ver._ Do not, my lord.

    _Doug._                 You do not counsel well:
    You speak it out of fear and cold heart.[2968]

    _Ver._ Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,[2969]
    And I dare well maintain it with my life,
    If well-respected honour bid me on,[2970]                            10
    I hold as little counsel with weak fear
    As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:[2971]
    Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle[2972][2973]
    Which of us fears.[2972]

    _Doug._            Yea, or to-night.[2974]

    _Ver._                               Content.

    _Hot._ To-night, say I.                                              15

    _Ver._ Come, come, it may not be. I wonder much,[2975]
    Being men of such great leading as you are,[2975][2976]
    That you foresee not what impediments
    Drag back our expedition: certain horse[2977]
    Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:                           20
    Your uncle Worcester's horse came but to-day;[2978]
    And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
    Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
    That not a horse is half the half of himself.[2979]

    _Hot._ So are the horses of the enemy                                25
    In general, journey-bated and brought low:
    The better part of ours are full of rest.

    _Wor._ The number of the king exceedeth ours:[2980]
    For God's sake, cousin, stay till all come in.

                                         [_The trumpet sounds a parley._

                       _Enter_ SIR WALTER BLUNT.

    _Blunt._ I come with gracious offers from the king,[2981]            30
    If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.

    _Hot._ Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
    You were of our determination!
    Some of us love you well; and even those some
    Envy your great deservings and good name,                            35
    Because you are not of our quality,
    But stand against us like an enemy.

    _Blunt._ And God defend but still I should stand so,[2982]
    So long as out of limit and true rule
    You stand against anointed majesty.                                  40
    But to my charge. The king hath sent to know[2983]
    The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
    You conjure from the breast of civil peace[2984]
    Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land[2985]
    Audacious cruelty. If that the king                                  45
    Have any way your good deserts forgot,[2986]
    Which he confesseth to be manifold,
    He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed[2987]
    You shall have your desires with interest[2988]
    And pardon absolute for yourself and these                           50
    Herein misled by your suggestion.

    _Hot._ The king is kind; and well we know the king[2989]
    Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
    My father and my uncle and myself[2990]
    Did give him that same royalty he wears;                             55
    And when he was not six and twenty strong,
    Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
    A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
    My father gave him welcome to the shore;
    And when he heard him swear and vow to God                           60
    He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,[2991]
    To sue his livery and beg his peace,[2992]
    With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,[2993]
    My father, in kind heart and pity moved,[2994]
    Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.[2995]                     65
    Now when the lords and barons of the realm
    Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
    The more and less came in with cap and knee;[2996]
    Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
    Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,[2997]                       70
    Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
    Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him[2998]
    Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
    He presently, as greatness knows itself,
    Steps me a little higher than his vow                                75
    Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
    Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
    And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
    Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
    That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,[2999]                        80
    Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
    Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,[3000]
    This seeming brow of justice, did he win
    The hearts of all that he did angle for;
    Proceeded further; cut me off the heads                              85
    Of all the favourites that the absent king
    In deputation left behind him here,
    When he was personal in the Irish war.

    _Blunt._ Tut, I came not to hear this.[3001]

    _Hot._                                 Then to the point.
    In short time after, he deposed the king;                            90
    Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
    And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state;[3002]
    To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
    Who is, if every owner were well placed,[3003]
    Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,[3004]                       95
    There without ransom to lie forfeited;
    Disgraced me in my happy victories,
    Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
    Rated mine uncle from the council-board;[3005]
    In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;                         100
    Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,[3006]
    And in conclusion drove us to seek out
    This head of safety; and withal to pry
    Into his title, the which we find[3007]
    Too indirect for long continuance.                                  105

    _Blunt._ Shall I return this answer to the king?

    _Hot._ Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.[3008]
    Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
    Some surety for a safe return again,[3009]
    And in the morning early shall my uncle                             110
    Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.[3010]

    _Blunt._ I would you would accept of grace and love.

    _Hot._ And may be so we shall.

    _Blunt._                       Pray God you do.     [_Exeunt._[3011]


SCENE IV. _York. The_ ARCHBISHOP'S _palace_.

        _Enter the_ ARCHBISHOP of YORK _and_ SIR MICHAEL.[3012]

    _Arch._ Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief[3013]
    With winged haste to the lord marshal;[3014]
    This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
    To whom they are directed. If you knew[3015]
    How much they do import, you would make haste.[3015]                  5

    _Sir M._ My good lord,[3016][3017]
    I guess their tenour.[3017]

    _Arch._               Like enough you do.[3018]
    To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
    Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
    Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,                        10
    As I am truly given to understand,
    The king with mighty and quick-raised power
    Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
    What with the sickness of Northumberland,
    Whose power was in the first proportion,                             15
    And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,[3019]
    Who with them was a rated sinew too[3020]
    And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,[3021]
    I fear the power of Percy is too weak
    To wage an instant trial with the king.                              20

    _Sir M._ Why, my good lord, you need not fear;[3022][3023]
    There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.[3022][3024][3025]

    _Arch._ No, Mortimer is not there.[3025]

    _Sir M._ But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,[3026]
    And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head[3027][3028]             25
    Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.[3027]

    _Arch._ And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
    The special head of all the land together:
    The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
    The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;                            30
    And many moe corrivals and dear men[3029]
    Of estimation and command in arms.

    _Sir M._ Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.[3030]

    _Arch._ I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
    And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:                       35
    For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king[3031]
    Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
    For he hath heard of our confederacy,[3032]
    And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
    Therefore make haste. I must go write again                          40
    To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.           [_Exeunt._

ACT V.


SCENE I. _The_ KING'S _camp near Shrewsbury_.

       _Enter the_ KING, PRINCE of WALES, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER,
     EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, _and_ FALSTAFF.[3033]

    _King._ How bloodily the sun begins to peer
    Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale[3034]
    At his distemperature.

    _Prince._              The southern wind
    Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
    And by his hollow whistling in the leaves[3035]                       5
    Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.

    _King._ Then with the losers let it sympathise,
    For nothing can seem foul to those that win.

                                                  [_The trumpet sounds._

                 _Enter_ WORCESTER _and_ VERNON.[3036]

    How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
    That you and I should meet upon such terms                           10
    As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
    And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
    To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:[3037]
    This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
    What say you to it? will you again unknit                            15
    This churlish knot of all-abhorred war?
    And move in that obedient orb again[3038]
    Where you did give a fair and natural light,
    And be no more an exhaled meteor,
    A prodigy of fear and a portent                                      20
    Of broached mischief to the unborn times?

    _Wor._ Hear me, my liege:
    For mine own part, I could be well content
    To entertain the lag-end of my life
    With quiet hours; for, I do protest,[3039]                           25
    I have not sought the day of this dislike.

    _King._ You have not sought it! how comes it, then?[3040]

    _Fal._ Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.

    _Prince._ Peace, chewet, peace![3041]

    _Wor._ It pleased your majesty to turn your looks                    30
    Of favour from myself and all our house;
    And yet I must remember you, my lord,
    We were the first and dearest of your friends.
    For you my staff of office did I break
    In Richard's time; and posted day and night                          35
    To meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
    When yet you were in place and in account
    Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
    It was myself, my brother, and his son,
    That brought you home, and boldly did outdare[3042]                  40
    The dangers of the time. You swore to us,[3043]
    And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,[3044]
    That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;[3045]
    Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
    The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:                             45
    To this we swore our aid. But in short space[3046]
    It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
    And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
    What with our help, what with the absent king,
    What with the injuries of a wanton time,[3047]                       50
    The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
    And the contrarious winds that held the king
    So long in his unlucky Irish wars[3048]
    That all in England did repute him dead:
    And from this swarm of fair advantages[3049]                         55
    You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
    To gripe the general sway into your hand;
    Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster;[3050]
    And being fed by us you used us so
    As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo's bird,[3051]                      60
    Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
    Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
    That even our love durst not come near your sight
    For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
    We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly                            65
    Out of your sight and raise this present head;
    Whereby we stand opposed by such means[3052]
    As you yourself have forged against yourself
    By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
    And violation of all faith and troth                                 70
    Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.[3053]

    _King._ These things indeed you have articulate,[3054]
    Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
    To face the garment of rebellion
    With some fine colour that may please the eye                        75
    Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
    Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
    Of hurlyburly innovation:
    And never yet did insurrection want
    Such water-colours to impaint his cause;                             80
    Nor moody beggars, starving for a time[3055]
    Of pellmell havoc and confusion.

    _Prince._ In both your armies there is many a soul[3056]
    Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,[3057]
    If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,                        85
    The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
    In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,[3058]
    This present enterprise set off his head,[3059]
    I do not think a braver gentleman,
    More active-valiant or more valiant-young,[3060]                     90
    More daring or more bold, is now alive
    To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
    For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
    I have a truant been to chivalry;
    And so I hear he doth account me too;                                95
    Yet this before my father's majesty--
    I am content that he shall take the odds
    Of his great name and estimation,
    And will, to save the blood on either side,
    Try fortune with him in a single fight.[3061]                       100

    _King._ And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,[3062]
    Albeit considerations infinite
    Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,[3063]
    We love our people well; even those we love
    That are misled upon your cousin's part;                            105
    And, will they take the offer of our grace,[3064]
    Both he and they and you, yea, every man
    Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:[3065]
    So tell your cousin, and bring me word[3066]
    What he will do: but if he will not yield,[3067]                    110
    Rebuke and dread correction wait on us[3068]
    And they shall do their office. So, be gone;
    We will not now be troubled with reply:
    We offer fair; take it advisedly.

                                   [_Exeunt Worcester and Vernon._[3069]

    _Prince._ It will not be accepted, on my life:                      115
    The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
    Are confident against the world in arms.

    _King._ Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
    For, on their answer, will we set on them:
    And God befriend us, as our cause is just!                          120

               [_Exeunt all but the Prince of Wales and Falstaff._[3070]

    _Fal._ Hal, if thou see me down in the battle, and[3071][3072]
    bestride me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.[3072][3073]

    _Prince._ Nothing but a colossus can do thee that[3072]
    friendship. Say thy prayers, and farewell.[3072]

    _Fal._ I would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.[3072][3074]      125

    _Prince._ Why, thou owest God a death.                [_Exit._[3075]

    _Fal._ 'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him
    before his day. What need I be so forward with him that
    calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks me
    on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I come on?[3076]       130
    how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or an arm? no:[3077]
    or take away the grief of a wound? no. Honour hath no
    skill in surgery, then? no. What is honour? a word. What[3078]
    is in that word honour? what is that honour? air. A trim[3078]
    reckoning! Who hath it? he that died o' Wednesday.[3079]            135
    Doth he feel it? no. Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible,[3080]
    then. Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living?[3081]
    no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore I'll none
    of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so ends my
    catechism.                                                [_Exit._  140


SCENE II. _The Rebel Camp._

                 _Enter_ WORCESTER _and_ VERNON.[3082]

    _Wor._ O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
    The liberal and kind offer of the king.[3083]

    _Ver._ 'Twere best he did.

    _Wor._                     Then are we all undone.[3084]
    It is not possible, it cannot be,
    The king should keep his word in loving us;[3085]                     5
    He will suspect us still, and find a time
    To punish this offence in other faults:[3086]
    Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;[3087]
    For treason is but trusted like the fox,[3088]
    Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,[3089]                10
    Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
    Look how we can, or sad or merrily,[3090]
    Interpretation will misquote our looks,
    And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
    The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.[3091]                  15
    My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
    It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood;
    And an adopted name of privilege,
    A hare-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
    All his offences live upon my head                                   20
    And on his father's; we did train him on,
    And, his corruption being ta'en from us,[3092]
    We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
    Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
    In any case, the offer of the king.                                  25

    _Ver._ Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.[3093][3094]
    Here comes your cousin.[3093]

                  _Enter_ HOTSPUR _and_ DOUGLAS.[3095]

    _Hot._ My uncle is return'd:[3096]
    Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.[3096]
    Uncle, what news?[3096]                                              30

    _Wor._ The king will bid you battle presently.

    _Doug._ Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.[3097]

    _Hot._ Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.[3097][3098]

    _Doug._ Marry, and shall, and very willingly.[3099]      [_Exit._

    _Wor._ There is no seeming mercy in the king.                        35

    _Hot._ Did you beg any? God forbid![3100][3101]

    _Wor._ I told him gently of our grievances,[3101][3102]
    Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
    By now forswearing that he is forsworn:[3103]
    He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge                       40
    With haughty arms this hateful name in us.

                       _Re-enter_ DOUGLAS.[3104]

    _Doug._ Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown
    A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
    And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
    Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.                        45

    _Wor._ The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
    And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.

    _Hot._ O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
    And that no man might draw short breath to-day
    But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,                          50
    How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?[3105]

    _Ver._ No, by my soul; I never in my life
    Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
    Unless a brother should a brother dare
    To gentle exercise and proof of arms.                                55
    He gave you all the duties of a man;
    Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,
    Spoke your deservings like a chronicle,
    Making you ever better than his praise
    By still dispraising praise valued with you:[3106]                   60
    And, which became him like a prince indeed,
    He made a blushing cital of himself;
    And chid his truant youth with such a grace[3107]
    As if he master'd there a double spirit[3108]
    Of teaching and of learning instantly.                               65
    There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
    If he outlive the envy of this day,
    England did never owe so sweet a hope,
    So much misconstrued in his wantonness.

    _Hot._ Cousin, I think thou art enamoured                            70
    On his follies: never did I hear[3109]
    Of any prince so wild a libertine.[3110]
    But be he as he will, yet once ere night
    I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
    That he shall shrink under my courtesy.                              75
    Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,[3111]
    Better consider what you have to do
    Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,[3112]
    Can lift your blood up with persuasion.

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Mess._ My lord, here are letters for you.[3113]                     80

    _Hot._ I cannot read them now.[3113]
    O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
    To spend that shortness basely were too long,[3114]
    If life did ride upon a dial's point,[3115]
    Still ending at the arrival of an hour.[3116]                        85
    An if we live, we live to tread on kings;[3117]
    If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
    Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,[3118]
    When the intent of bearing them is just.

                    _Enter another_ Messenger.[3119]

    _Mess._ My Lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.                   90

    _Hot._ I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
    For I profess not talking; only this--
    Let each man do his best: and here draw I[3120][3121]
    A sword, whose temper I intend to stain[3121][3122]
    With the best blood that I can meet withal                           95
    In the adventure of this perilous day.
    Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.[3123]
    Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
    And by that music let us all embrace;
    For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall[3124]                  100
    A second time do such a courtesy.

                  [_The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt._[3125]


SCENE III. _Plain between the camps._[3126]

      _The King enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then
                enter_ DOUGLAS _and_ SIR WALTER BLUNT.

    _Blunt._ What is thy name, that in the battle thus[3127][3128][3129]
    Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek[3127][3129][3130]
    Upon my head?[3127]

    _Doug._       Know then, my name is Douglas;
    And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
    Because some tell me that thou art a king.[3131]                      5

    _Blunt._ They tell thee true.

    _Doug._ The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought[3132]
    Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
    This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
    Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.[3133]                         10

    _Blunt._ I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;[3134]
    And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
    Lord Stafford's death.           [_They fight. Douglas kills Blunt._

                         _Enter_ HOTSPUR.[3135]

    _Hot._ O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,[3136]
    I never had triumph'd upon a Scot.[3137]                             15

    _Doug._ All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.

    _Hot._ Where?

    _Doug._ Here.

    _Hot._ This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:[3138]
    A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;                         20
    Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.

    _Doug._ A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes![3139]
    A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:[3140]
    Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?

    _Hot._ The king hath many marching in his coats.[3141]               25

    _Doug._ Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
    I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
    Until I meet the king.

    _Hot._                 Up, and away!
    Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.               [_Exeunt._

                _Alarum. Enter_ FALSTAFF, _solus_.[3142]

    _Fal._ Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear             30
    the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate. Soft!
    who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour for you![3143]
    here's no vanity! I am as hot as molten lead, and as
    heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I need no more[3144]
    weight than mine own bowels. I have led my ragamuffins[3145]         35
    where they are peppered: there's not three of my hundred[3146][3147]
    and fifty left alive; and they are for the town's end, to
        beg[3147][3148]
    during life. But who comes here?

                          _Enter the_ PRINCE.

    _Prince._ What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:[3149]
    Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff[3150]                           40
    Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
    Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee, lend me thy sword.[3151]

    _Fal._ O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
    Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done
    this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.[3152]             45

    _Prince._ He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I[3153]
    prithee, lend me thy sword.[3154]

    _Fal._ Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou[3155]
    get'st not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.[3156]

    _Prince._ Give it me: what, is it in the case?[3157]                 50

    _Fal._ Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a[3158]
    city.

                          [_The Prince draws it out, and finds it to be
                                               a bottle of sack._[3159]

    _Prince._ What, is it a time to jest and dally now?

                             [_He throws the bottle at him. Exit._[3160]

    _Fal._ Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do[3161]
    come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his willingly,[3162]  55
    let him make a carbonado of me. I like not such grinning
    honour as Sir Walter hath: give me life: which if I can
    save, so; if not, honour comes unlooked for, and there's an
    end.                                                        [_Exit._


SCENE IV. _Another part of the field._

    _Alarum. Excursions. Enter the_ KING, _the_ PRINCE, LORD JOHN OF
              LANCASTER, _and_ EARL of WESTMORELAND.[3163]

    _King._ I prithee,[3164]
    Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.[3164][3165]
    Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.[3164]

    _Lan._ Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.

    _Prince._ I beseech your majesty, make up,[3166]                      5
    Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.[3167]

    _King._ I will do so.[3168]
    My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.[3168]

    _West._ Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.[3169]

    _Prince._ Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:                 10
    And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive[3170]
    The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
    Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,[3171]
    And rebels' arms triumph in massacres!

    _Lan._ We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,               15
    Our duty this way lies; for God's sake, come.

                           [_Exeunt Prince John and Westmoreland._[3172]

    _Prince._ By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;[3170]
    I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
    Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
    But now, I do respect thee as my soul.                               20

    _King._ I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
    With lustier maintenance than I did look for
    Of such an ungrown warrior.

    _Prince._                   O, this boy[3173]
    Lends mettle to us all![3173]                         [_Exit._

                         _Enter_ DOUGLAS.[3174]

    _Doug._ Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:                  25
    I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
    That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
    That counterfeit'st the person of a king?

    _K. Hen._ The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
    So many of his shadows thou hast met                                 30
    And not the very king. I have two boys
    Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
    But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
    I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.[3175]

    _Doug._ I fear thou art another counterfeit;                         35
    And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
    But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
    And thus I win thee.

                                        [_They fight; the King being in
                               danger, re-enter Prince of Wales._[3176]

    _Prince._ Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like[3177]
    Never to hold it up again! the spirits                               40
    Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:[3178]
    It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;[3179]
    Who never promiseth but he means to pay.

                                           [_They fight: Douglas flies._

    Cheerly, my lord: how fares your grace?
    Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent,                           45
    And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.

    _King._ Stay, and breathe awhile:[3180]
    Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,[3181]
    And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
    In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.                         50

    _Prince._ O God! they did me too much injury[3182]
    That ever said I hearken'd for your death.[3183]
    If it were so, I might have let alone
    The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
    Which would have been as speedy in your end                          55
    As all the poisonous potions in the world,
    And saved the treacherous labour of your son.

    _King._ Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.[3184] [_Exit._

                            _Enter_ HOTSPUR.

    _Hot._ If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.[3185]

    _Prince._ Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.[3186]            60

    _Hot._ My name is Harry Percy.

    _Prince._                      Why, then I see[3187]
    A very valiant rebel of the name.[3187][3188]
    I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
    To share with me in glory any more:
    Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;                       65
    Nor can one England brook a double reign,
    Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.

    _Hot._ Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
    To end the one of us; and would to God[3189]
    Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!                          70

    _Prince._ I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
    And all the budding honours on thy crest[3190]
    I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.

    _Hot._ I can no longer brook thy vanities.      [_They fight._[3191]

                           _Enter_ FALSTAFF.

    _Fal._ Well said, Hal! to it, Hal! Nay, you shall find               75
    no boy's play here, I can tell you.

    _Re-enter_ DOUGLAS; _he fights with_ FALSTAFF, _who falls down
    as if he were dead, and exit_ DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR _is wounded, and
                             falls_.[3192]

    _Hot._ O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth![3193]
    I better brook the loss of brittle life[3194]
    Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
    They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh:[3195]          80
    But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;[3196]
    And time, that takes survey of all the world,
    Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
    But that the earthy and cold hand of death[3197]
    Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust,                         85
    And food for--                                              [_Dies._

    _Prince._ For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart![3198]
    Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
    When that this body did contain a spirit,
    A kingdom for it was too small a bound;                              90
    But now two paces of the vilest earth
    Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead[3199]
    Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
    If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
    I should not make so dear a show of zeal:[3200]                      95
    But let my favours hide thy mangled face;[3201]
    And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
    For doing these fair rites of tenderness.[3202]
    Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
    Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,[3203]                    100
    But not remember'd in thy epitaph!

                              [_He spieth Falstaff on the ground._[3204]

    What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
    Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
    I could have better spared a better man:
    O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,                              105
    If I were much in love with vanity!
    Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,[3205]
    Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
    Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
    Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.                    [_Exit._  110

    _Fal._ [_Rising up_] Embowelled! if thou embowel me[3206]
    to-day, I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
    to-morrow. 'Sblood, 'twas time to counterfeit, or that hot[3207]
    termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too. Counterfeit? I[3208]
    lie, I am no counterfeit: to die, is to be a counterfeit; for[3208] 115
    he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of
    a man: but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liveth,
    is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of
    life indeed. The better part of valour is discretion; in the
    which better part I have saved my life. 'Zounds, I am[3209]         120
    afraid of this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if[3210]
    he should counterfeit too, and rise? by my faith, I am[3211]
    afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore
    I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I killed him. Why[3212]
    may not he rise as well as I? Nothing confutes me but               125
    eyes, and nobody sees me. Therefore, sirrah [_stabbing[3213]
    him_], with a new wound in your thigh, come you along[3214]
    with me.                            [_Takes up Hotspur on his back._

   _Re-enter the_ PRINCE of WALES _and_ LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER.[3215]

    _Prince._ Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd[3216]
    Thy maiden sword.

    _Lan._            But, soft! whom have we here?[3217]               130
    Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?

    _Prince._ I did; I saw him dead,[3218]
    Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art thou alive?[3218][3219]
    Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?[3218]
    I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes[3218]                  135
    Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.[3218]

    _Fal._ No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if
    I be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy[3220]
    [_throwing the body down_]: if your father will do me any[3221]
    honour, so; if not, let him kill the next Percy himself. I[3222]    140
    look to be either earl or duke, I can assure you.

    _Prince._ Why, Percy I killed myself, and saw thee dead.[3223]

    _Fal._ Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given[3224]
    to lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath; and
    so was he: but we rose both at an instant, and fought a long        145
    hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be believed, so; if not,
    let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their
    own heads. I'll take it upon my death, I gave him this[3225]
    wound in the thigh: if the man were alive, and would deny
    it, 'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.[3226]        150

    _Lan._ This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.[3227]

    _Prince._ This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
    Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
    For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
    I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.                        155

                                          [_A retreat is sounded._[3228]

    The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.[3229]
    Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
    To see what friends are living, who are dead.[3230]

                                [_Exeunt Prince of Wales and Lancaster._

    _Fal._ I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that rewards
    me, God reward him! If I do grow great, I'll grow[3231]             160
    less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and live cleanly as a
    nobleman should do.                                   [_Exit._[3232]


SCENE V. _Another part of the field._

    _The trumpets sound. Enter the_ KING, PRINCE of WALES, LORD JOHN
        OF LANCASTER, EARL of WESTMORELAND, _with_ WORCESTER _and_
        VERNON _prisoners_.[3233]

    _King._ Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.[3234]
    Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,[3235]
    Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
    And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
    Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust?                             5
    Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
    A noble earl and many a creature else
    Had been alive this hour,[3236]
    If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
    Betwixt our armies true intelligence.                                10

    _Wor._ What I have done my safety urged me to;
    And I embrace this fortune patiently,
    Since not to be avoided it falls on me.[3237]

    _King._ Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too:[3238]
    Other offenders we will pause upon.                                  15

                          [_Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, guarded._[3239]

    How goes the field?

    _Prince._ The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw[3240]
    The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,[3241]
    The noble Percy slain, and all his men
    Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;                           20
    And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
    That the pursuers took him. At my tent
    The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
    I may dispose of him.

    _King._               With all my heart.

    _Prince._ Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you[3242]              25
    This honourable bounty shall belong:[3242]
    Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
    Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
    His valour shown upon our crests to-day[3243]
    Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds[3243][3244]            30
    Even in the bosom of our adversaries.

    _Lan._ I thank your grace for this high courtesy,[3245]
    Which I shall give away immediately.[3245][3246]

    _King._ Then this remains, that we divide our power.
    You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland                            35
    Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,[3247]
    To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,[3248]
    Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
    Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,[3249]
    To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.                       40
    Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,[3250]
    Meeting the check of such another day:
    And since this business so fair is done,[3251]
    Let us not leave till all our own be won.                 [_Exeunt._

NOTES.


NOTE I.

A list of Dramatis Personæ in MS. of an early time is prefixed to
Capell's copy of the sixth Quarto.

'Falstaff' is spelt 'Falstaffe' or 'Falstalffe' in the Quartos, but
consistently 'Falstaffe' in the first Folio.

'Poins' is spelt 'Poines' or 'Poynes' in the Quartos, and occasionally,
in the Folio, 'Pointz,' as it is in _The Merry Wives of Windsor_,
III. 2. 63.

'Bardolph,' spelt thus, or 'Bardolfe,' in the Folio, is 'Bardoll' or
'Bardol' in the Quartos. We retain the spelling which is most familiar
in names so well known.


NOTE II.

I. 1. 28. Mr Staunton says that 'now is twelve _months_ old' is the
reading of the first Quarto. Capell's copy has 'now is twelue _month_
old.'


NOTE III.

I. 1. 62. We take this opportunity of reminding our readers that we
have not recorded minute variations of spelling except where they
seemed to have importance as helping to determine the text. We give as
a general rule the spelling of the earliest copy.


NOTE IV.

I. 1. 73. Capell says: "Too hasty a perusal of a passage in Holinshed
betray'd Shakespeare into a mistake in this place. The 'earl of
Fife' was not 'son to Douglas' but to a duke of Albany, as the same
chronicler tells us soon after; and in this passage too, was it rightly
pointed, and a little attended to: for that duke was then governour;
_i.e._ of Scotland; and the word governour should have a comma after
it, or (rather) a semi-colon." He goes on to say that the mistake is
repeated I. 3. 261, and proposes to give historical truth to both these
passages by reading:

    (1)                 'Prisoners to Hotspur are
            Mordake the earl of Fife; and he himself
            The beaten Douglas; and with him, &c.'

    (2)     'And make the regent's son your only mean
            For powers in Scotland.'

That is (says Capell) by delivering him, as it appears they did by some
words of the Poet himself, p. 85 (_i.e_. IV. 4. 23), where the earl of
Fife is spoken of as making a part of Hotspur's army at Shrewsbury.


NOTE V.

I. 1. 75-77. The first and second Quartos read:

            'A gallant prize? Ha coosen, is it not?    In faith it is.

    _West._ A conquest for a Prince to boast of,'

leaving a blank between 'not?' and 'In faith.' The subsequent Quartos
and the Folios have the same reading without the blank. Pope reads:

            'A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?

    _West._ In faith, a conquest for a prince to boast of.'

Rann has, for the second line,

    '_West._ 'Faith 'tis a conquest for a prince to boast of,'

a reading which Malone by mistake assigns to Pope.

Malone himself gives:

    '_West._ In faith, it is a conquest for a prince
             To boast of.'

Capell reads:

    '_West._ It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.'

Dr Nicholson proposes:

            'A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not,
            In faith?

    _West._ A conquest for a prince to boast of.'

For, he says, 'In faith' sounds too familiar to be addressed by a
subject to his king.


NOTE VI.

I. 2. 56. "Here," says Mr Dyce, "all the old copies, I believe, have
'--when thou art _a_ king' &c. but erroneously." Four of the Quartos,
the first, second, seventh and eighth, have 'when thou art king,' which
is unquestionably the right reading.


NOTE VII.

I. 2. 97. The first and second Quartos read as in the text. The third
and following Quartos and the Folios print _Poines_ in italics, as if
the words 'Now shall we know ... true man' were spoken by him.


NOTE VIII.

I. 2. 148. Theobald was the first to suggest that Harvey and Rossill
were the names of the actors who performed the parts of Peto and
Bardolph. But in II. 4. 165, 167, 171 for '_Ross._' which is found
in the Quartos the Folios substitute not '_Bard._' but '_Gad._' i.e.
'_Gadshill_.'


NOTE IX.

I. 2. 175. Steevens claimed as his own conjecture the reading
'to-night,' which Capell had adopted in his text. Mr Knight punctuates,
'and meet me. To-morrow night, &c.'


NOTE X.

II. I. 6, 11. Either the article or the pronoun was intentionally
omitted in these passages, in order to give rusticity to the carriers'
language. The Folios supply the article in the former passage, but
leave the latter untouched.


NOTE XI.

II. I. 72. We have recorded Jackson's conjecture in this passage as a
curiosity. Its full value can only be appreciated by reading his own
explanation. In many other cases the emendations of Becket and Jackson
are quoted as amusing instances of the licence which they permitted
themselves.


NOTE XII.

II. 2. 46, 47. The first and second Quartos here read 'Bardoll, what
newes?' as part of Poins's speech, and in the same line with it. The
third, fourth, fifth and sixth have, '_Bardol_ what newes?' the seventh
and eighth, _Bardol_, what newes?' _Bardol_ being in italics. In the
Folios, '_Bardolfe_, what newes?' is put in a separate line, and this
arrangement appears to have suggested Johnson's conjecture. We have
omitted, as unnecessary, many of the stage directions which editors
have introduced into this scene, because the whole affair takes place
in the dark.


NOTE XIII.

II. 4. 245. Capell's misprint, 'how plain a tale,' which he corrected
in MS. as well as in his notes, was followed by Malone and other
editors.


NOTE XIV.

II. 4. 481. Johnson was the first to suggest that Poins and not Peto
should remain with the Prince. 'I cannot but suspect,' he says, 'that
for Peto we should read Poins: what had Peto done that his place should
be honourable, or that he should be trusted with the plot against
Falstaff? Poins has the prince's confidence, and is a man of courage.
This alteration clears the whole difficulty, they all retired but
Poins, who, with the prince, having only robbed the robbers, had no
need to conceal himself from the travellers.' Johnson's last-mentioned
reason for the alteration has less weight when we consider that they
all wore vizards. In favour of his conjecture we find that the Dering
MS. has 'Poynes' for 'Peto' in line 523, and in the stage directions to
lines 504, 508, 524. On the other hand, the formal 'Good morrow, good
my lord' is appropriate to Peto rather than to Poins, who was on much
more familiar terms with the prince, and rarely addresses him in this
play except as 'Hal.' We have therefore left the old text undisturbed.


NOTE XV.

III. 2. 174-176. The first Quarto, whose arrangement is followed in all
the other Quartos, reads:

    'On thursday we our selues will march. Our meeting
    Is Bridgenorth, and Harry, you shall march
    Through Glocestershire, by which account ...'

The first Folio has:

    'On Thursday, wee our selues will march.
    Our meeting is Bridgenorth: and Harry, you shall march
    Through Glocestershire: by which account....'

Pope altered the passage thus:

    'On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
    Is at Bridgenorth; and Harry, you shall march
    Through Glo'stershire: by which, some twelve days hence
    Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.'

Capell's arrangement, taking in the previous line, is as follows:

    'On Wednesday next, son Harry, you shall set
    Forward; on thursday, we ourselves will march.
    Our meeting is Bridgnorth and, Harry, you
    Shall march through Glocestershire; by which account....'


NOTE XVI.

III. 3. 81. Theobald was the first to insert the words 'and Peto' in
the stage directions. They are omitted in the Quartos and Folios, and
Steevens following Johnson's conjecture, changed them to 'and Pointz.'
This alteration is supported by the reading of the Dering MS. in line
186, 'Poynes' for 'Peto.' But 'Peto' is found in the text in III. 3.
186. It is true, as Johnson points out, that Peto is afterwards (IV. 2.
9) mentioned as Falstaff's lieutenant, but this may be the honourable
place which the prince had promised him (II. 4. 519).


NOTE XVII.

III. 3. 187. Steevens adopted, without acknowledgement, Capell's
arrangement:

    'Jack,
    Meet me to-morrow in the Temple hall.'


NOTE XVIII.

IV. 1. 54. It is not improbable that a line may have been lost after
_reversion_.


NOTE XIX.

IV. 1. 99. We leave this obscure passage as it stands in the old
copies. Possibly, as Steevens suggested, a line has dropped out after
_wind_. The phrase 'wing the wind' seems to apply to ostriches (for
such is unquestionably the meaning of 'estridges') less than to any
other birds. Mr Dyce quotes a passage from Claudian (_In Eutropium_,
II. 310-313) to justify it:

    'Vasta velut Libyæ venantum vocibus ales
    Cum premitur, calidas cursu transmittit arenas,
    Inque modum veli sinuatis flamine pennis
    Pulverulenta volat.'

But this means that the bird spreads its wings like a sail bellying
with the wind--a different thing from 'winging the wind.'

Malone, agreeing with Steevens that a line might have been lost,
suggested the following:

    'All plum'd like estridges, that with the wind
    _Run on, in gallant trim they now advance_:
    Bated like eagles, &c.'


NOTE XX.

IV. 4. 22. We leave these lines as they are in the Quartos and Folios.
Pope read the passage, perhaps rightly, as prose. Steevens smoothed the
lines thus:

    '_Gent._ Why, good my lord, you need not fear; there's Douglas,
             And Mortimer.

    _Arch._                No, Mortimer's not there.'


NOTE XXI.

V. 1. We have followed the Quartos, Folios, and all editors till
Capell's time, in leaving the 'Earl of Westmoreland' among the persons
entering. He does not speak, indeed, but it might be intended that he
should be present as a mute person for the nonce. On the same principle
we have left 'Lord John of Lancaster' in the stage direction of I. 1.


NOTE XXII.

V. 2. 72. Mr Collier reads 'wild o' liberty,' observing in a note that
the three oldest Quartos have this reading. The true reading of these
Quartos, and the fourth, is what we have given in the foot-note, 'wild
a libertie.' Mr Grant White retains it in his text, interpreting 'never
did I hear so wild a liberty reported of any prince.' Pope also adopted
this reading without any note of explanation. Theobald restored what
he called 'the reading of the old copies' and punctuated thus: 'Of any
prince, so wild, at liberty.'


NOTE XXIII.

V. 2. 101. The stage direction of the first Quarto is literally as
follows: _Here they embrace the trumpets sound, the King enters with
his power, alarme to the battel, then enter Douglas, and Sir Walter
Blunt._ The Folios have substantially the same, omitting the word
'_Here_.' They indicate no change of scene in this place. The Quartos
do not, either here or elsewhere, mark any division into act or scene.


NOTE XXIV.

V. 4. 136, sqq. Pope reads thus:

    'I did, I saw him dead
    And breathless on the ground: art thou alive,
    Or is it Fancy plays upon our eye-sight?
    I pr'ythee speak, we will not trust our eyes
    Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.'

Capell thus:

    'I did; I saw him dead, breathless and bleeding
    Upon the ground.--
    Art thou alive? or is it fantasy,
    That plays upon our eye-sight? I pr'ythee, speak;
    We will not trust our eyes without our ears:
    Thou art not what thou seem'st.'


NOTE XXV.

V. 5. 30. Malone reads 'shewn' on the authority of the Quarto of 1598.
But Capell's copy of that edition has 'taught,' and this is the reading
of Malone's own copy, now in the Bodleian Library.

INDUCTION.


                    _Warkworth. Before the castle._

            _Enter_ Rumour, _painted full of tongues_.[3252]

    _Rum._ Open your ears; for which of you will stop
    The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
    I, from the orient to the drooping west,
    Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
    The acts commenced on this ball of earth:                             5
    Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,[3253]
    The which in every language I pronounce,
    Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.[3254]
    I speak of peace, while covert enmity
    Under the smile of safety wounds the world:                          10
    And who but Rumour, who but only I,
    Make fearful musters and prepared defence,
    Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,[3255]
    Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
    And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe                                 15
    Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,[3256]
    And of so easy and so plain a stop
    That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
    The still-discordant wavering multitude,[3257]
    Can play upon it. But what need I thus                               20
    My well-known body to anatomize[3258]
    Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
    I run before King Harry's victory;
    Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
    Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,                       25
    Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
    Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I
    To speak so true at first? my office is[3259]
    To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
    Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,                            30
    And that the king before the Douglas' rage
    Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
    This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns[3260]
    Between that royal field of Shrewsbury[3261]
    And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,[3262]                      35
    Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,[3263]
    Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,[3264]
    And not a man of them brings other news
    Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues[3265]
    They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.[3266]      40

SCENE I. _The same._

                      _Enter_ LORD BARDOLPH.[3267]

    _L. Bard._ Who keeps the gate here, ho?[3268]

                     _The_ Porter _opens the gate_.

                                                  Where is the earl?

    _Port._ What shall I say you are?

    _L. Bard._                        Tell thou the earl
    That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.

    _Port._ His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard:
    Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,                         5
    And he himself will answer.

                        _Enter_ NORTHUMBERLAND.

    _L. Bard._                  Here comes the earl.

                                                   [_Exit Porter._[3269]

    _North._ What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
    Should be the father of some stratagem:
    The times are wild; contention, like a horse
    Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose                         10
    And bears down all before him.

    _L. Bard._                     Noble earl,
    I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.

    _North._ Good, an God will![3270]

    _L. Bard._              As good as heart can wish:
    The king is almost wounded to the death;
    And, in the fortune of my lord your son,                             15
    Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
    Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
    And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;
    And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
    Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,                              20
    So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won.
    Came not till now to dignify the times,
    Since Cæsar's fortunes!

    _North._                How is this derived?
    Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?

    _L. Bard._ I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,[3271]   25
    A gentleman well bred and of good name,
    That freely render'd me these news for true.

    _North._ Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent[3272]
    On Tuesday last to listen after news.

                         _Enter_ TRAVERS.[3273]

    _L. Bard._ My lord, I over-rode him on the way;                      30
    And he is furnish'd with no certainties
    More than he haply may retail from me.[3274]

    _North._ Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?[3275]

    _Tra._ My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back[3276]
    With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,                       35
    Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard[3277]
    A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
    That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
    He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
    I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:                              40
    He told me that rebellion had bad luck[3278]
    And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
    With that, he gave his able horse the head,
    And bending forward struck his armed heels[3279]
    Against the panting sides of his poor jade                           45
    Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
    He seem'd in running to devour the way,
    Staying no longer question.

    _North._                     Ha! Again:
    Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
    Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion[3280]                            50
    Had met ill luck?[3280]

    _L. Bard._         My lord, I'll tell you what;[3281]
    If my young lord your son have not the day,
    Upon mine honour, for a silken point
    I'll give my barony: never talk of it.[3282]

    _North._ Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers[3283]        55
    Give then such instances of loss?

    _L. Bard._                         Who, he?
    He was some hilding fellow that had stolen[3284]
    The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
    Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.[3285]

                            _Enter_ MORTON.

    _North._ Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,[3286]           60
    Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
    So looks the strond whereon the imperious flood[3287]
    Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
    Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?

    _Mor._ I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;                         65
    Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
    To fright our party.

    _North._             How doth my son and brother?
    Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
    Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
    Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,                            70
    So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,[3288]
    Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
    And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
    But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,[3289]
    And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.                        75
    This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
    Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
    Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
    But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,[3290]
    Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,                           80
    Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'

    _Mor._ Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;[3291]
    But, for my lord your son,--

    _North._                     Why, he is dead.[3292]
    See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
    He that but fears the thing he would not know                        85
    Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes[3293]
    That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;[3294]
    Tell thou an earl his divination lies,[3295]
    And I will take it as a sweet disgrace,
    And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.                          90

    _Mor._ You are too great to be by me gainsaid:
    Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.

    _North._ Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.[3296]
    I see a strange confession in thine eye:[3296]
    Thou shakest thy head, and hold'st it fear or sin[3296]              95
    To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;[3296][3297]
    The tongue offends not that reports his death:[3296]
    And he doth sin that doth belie the dead;[3296]
    Not he which says the dead is not alive.[3296]
    Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news[3296]                       100
    Hath but a losing office, and his tongue[3296]
    Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,[3296]
    Remember'd tolling a departing friend.[3296][3298]

    _L. Bard._ I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.

    _Mor._ I am sorry I should force you to believe[3299]               105
    That which I would to God I had not seen;[3300]
    But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
    Rendering faint quittance, wearied and outbreathed,
    To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down[3301]
    The never-daunted Percy to the earth,                               110
    From whence with life he never more sprung up.
    In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
    Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
    Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
    From the best-temper'd courage in his troops;                       115
    For from his metal was his party steel'd;[3302]
    Which once in him abated, all the rest[3303]
    Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:
    And as the thing that's heavy in itself,
    Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,                         120
    So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
    Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
    That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim[3304]
    Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
    Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester[3305]             125
    Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,[3306]
    The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword
    Had three times slain the appearance of the king,
    'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
    Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,                130
    Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
    Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out
    A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
    Under the conduct of young Lancaster
    And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.                         135

    _North._ For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
    In poison there is physic; and these news,[3307]
    Having been well, that would have made me sick,[3308]
    Being sick, have in some measure made me well:[3309]
    And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,                     140
    Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,[3310]
    Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
    Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
    Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,[3311]
    Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch![3312]    145
    A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
    Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!
    Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
    Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.[3313]
    Now bind my brows with iron; and approach                           150
    The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring[3314]
    To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!
    Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand
    Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!
    And let this world no longer be a stage[3315]                       155
    To feed contention in a lingering act;
    But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
    Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
    On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
    And darkness be the burier of the dead!                             160

    _Tra._ This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.[3316]

    _L. Bard._ Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.

    _Mor._ The lives of all your loving complices
    Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er[3317]
    To stormy passion, must perforce decay.                             165
    You cast the event of war, my noble lord,[3318]
    And summ'd the account of chance, before you said[3318]
    'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,[3318]
    That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:[3318]
    You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,[3318]                   170
    More likely to fall in than to get o'er;[3318]
    You were advised his flesh was capable[3318]
    Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit[3318]
    Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:[3318]
    Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,[3318]                 175
    Though strongly apprehended, could restrain[3318]
    The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,[3318]
    Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,[3318][3319]
    More than that being which was like to be?[3318]

    _L. Bard._ We all that are engaged to this loss                     180
    Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
    That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one;[3320]
    And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed[3321]
    Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;
    And since we are o'erset, venture again.                            185
    Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.[3322]

    _Mor._ 'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,
    I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,[3323]
    The gentle Archbishop of York is up[3324]
    With well-appointed powers: he is a man[3324]                       190
    Who with a double surety binds his followers.[3324]
    My lord your son had only but the corpse,[3324][3325]
    But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;[3324]
    For that same word, rebellion, did divide[3324]
    The action of their bodies from their souls;[3324]                  195
    And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,[3324]
    As men drink potions, that their weapons only[3324]
    Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,[3324]
    This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,[3324]
    As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop[3324][3326]               200
    Turns insurrection to religion:[3324]
    Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,[3324]
    He's followed both with body and with mind;[3324]
    And doth enlarge his rising with the blood[3324][3327]
    Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;[3324]            205
    Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;[3324]
    Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,[3324]
    Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;[3324]
    And more and less do flock to follow him.[3324]

    _North._ I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,                210
    This present grief had wiped it from my mind.
    Go in with me; and counsel every man
    The aptest way for safety and revenge:
    Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:
    Never so few, and never yet more need.[3328]      [_Exeunt._        215


SCENE II. _London. A street._

       _Enter_ FALSTAFF, _with his_ Page _bearing his sword and
                            buckler_.[3329]

    _Fal._ Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my
    water?

    _Page._ He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy[3330]
    water; but, for the party that owed it, he might have more[3331]
    diseases than he knew for.[3332]                                      5

    _Fal._ Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the
    brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to[3333]
    invent any thing that tends to laughter, more than I invent[3334]
    or is invented on me: I am not only witty in myself, but
    the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before            10
    thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one.[3335]
    If the prince put thee into my service for any other reason
    than to set me off, why then I have no judgement. Thou
    whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap
    than to wait at my heels. I was never manned with an[3336]           15
    agate till now: but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver,[3337]
    but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master,[3338]
    for a jewel,--the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin[3338]
    is not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in the[3339]
    palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek; and[3340]        20
    yet he will not stick to say his face is a face-royal: God[3341]
    may finish it when he will, 'tis not a hair amiss yet: he may[3342]
    keep it still at a face-royal, for a barber shall never earn[3343]
    sixpence out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had[3344]
    writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may                25
    keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine, I can[3345]
    assure him. What said Master Dombledon about the satin[3346]
    for my short cloak and my slops?[3347]

    _Page._ He said, sir, you should procure him better
    assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his band[3348]            30
    and yours; he liked not the security.

    _Fal._ Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God[3349]
    his tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally[3350]
    yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand, and then
    stand upon security! The whoreson smooth-pates do now[3351]          35
    wear nothing but high shoes, and bunches of keys at their
    girdles; and if a man is through with them in honest taking[3352]
    up, then they must stand upon security. I had as lief they[3353]
    would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
    security. I looked a' should have sent me two and twenty[3354]       40
    yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me[3355]
    security. Well, he may sleep in security; for he hath the
    horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines
    through it: and yet cannot he see, though he have his own
    lanthorn to light him. Where's Bardolph?[3356]                       45

    _Page._ He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship[3357]
    a horse.

    _Fal._ I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse
    in Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the stews, I[3358]
    were manned, horsed, and wived.                                      50

          _Enter the_ Lord Chief Justice _and_ Servant.[3359]

    _Page._ Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed[3360]
    the prince for striking him about Bardolph.

    _Fal._ Wait close; I will not see him.[3361]

    _Ch. Just._ What's he that goes there?

    _Serv._ Falstaff, an't please your lordship.[3362]                   55

    _Ch. Just._ He that was in question for the robbery?

    _Serv._ He, my lord: but he hath since done good service
    at Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some
    charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.

    _Ch. Just._ What, to York? Call him back again.                      60

    _Serv._ Sir John Falstaff!

    _Fal._ Boy, tell him I am deaf.

    _Page._ You must speak louder; my master is deaf.

    _Ch. Just._ I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing
    good. Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.             65

    _Serv._ Sir John!

    _Fal._ What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not[3363]
    wars? is there not employment? doth not the king lack[3364]
    subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers? Though it be a[3365]
    shame to be on any side but one, it is worse shame to beg            70
    than to be on the worst side, were it worse than the name
    of rebellion can tell how to make it.

    _Serv._ You mistake me, sir.

    _Fal._ Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man?[3366]
    setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in        75
    my throat, if I had said so.[3367]

    _Serv._ I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and
    your soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you, you
    lie in your throat, if you say I am any other than an[3368]
    honest man.                                                          80

    _Fal._ I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that
    which grows to me! If thou gettest any leave of me, hang
    me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be hanged. You
    hunt counter: hence! avaunt![3369]

    _Serv._ Sir, my lord would speak with you.                           85

    _Ch. Just._ Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.

    _Fal._ My good lord! God give your lordship good time[3370]
    of day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard say[3371]
    your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship goes abroad
    by advice. Your lordship, though not clean past your                 90
    youth, hath yet some smack of age in you, some relish of[3372]
    the saltness of time; and I most humbly beseech your[3373]
    lordship to have a reverend care of your health.

    _Ch. Just._ Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition[3374]
    to Shrewsbury.                                                       95

    _Fal._ An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is[3375]
    returned with some discomfort from Wales.[3376]

    _Ch. Just._ I talk not of his majesty: you would not
    come when I sent for you.

    _Fal._ And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into            100
    this same whoreson apoplexy.

    _Ch. Just._ Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me[3377]
    speak with you.

    _Fal._ This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,
    an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the blood,[3378]   105
    a whoreson tingling.

    _Ch. Just._ What tell you me of it? be it as it is.

    _Fal._ It hath its original from much grief, from study[3379]
    and perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of his[3380]
    effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.[3380]                   110

    _Ch. Just._ I think you are fallen into the disease; for
    you hear not what I say to you.

    _Fal._ Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please[3381]
    you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady of not
    marking, that I am troubled withal.                                 115

    _Ch. Just._ To punish you by the heels would amend the
    attention of your ears; and I care not if I do become your[3382]
    physician.

    _Fal._ I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:
    your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to            120
    me in respect of poverty; but how I should be your patient
    to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram
    of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.

    _Ch. Just._ I sent for you, when there were matters
    against you for your life, to come speak with me.[3383]             125

    _Fal._ As I was then advised by my learned counsel in[3384]
    the laws of this land-service, I did not come.

    _Ch. Just._ Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great
    infamy.

    _Fal._ He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.[3385]    130

    _Ch. Just._ Your means are very slender, and your waste[3386]
    is great.[3387]

    _Fal._ I would it were otherwise; I would my means
    were greater, and my waist slenderer.[3388]

    _Ch. Just._ You have misled the youthful prince.                    135

    _Fal._ The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow[3389]
    with the great belly, and he my dog.

    _Ch. Just._ Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound:
    your day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over
    your night's exploit on Gads-hill: you may thank the unquiet        140
    time for your quiet o'er-posting that action.

    _Fal._ My lord?[3390]

    _Ch. Just._ But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
    sleeping wolf.

    _Fal._ To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.[3391]            145

    _Ch. Just._ What! you are as a candle, the better part
    burnt out.

    _Fal._ A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say[3392]
    of wax, my growth would approve the truth.

    _Ch. Just._ There is not a white hair on your face but              150
    should have his effect of gravity.

    _Fal._ His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.

    _Ch. Just._ You follow the young prince up and down,
    like his ill angel.[3393]

    _Fal._ Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I[3394]        155
    hope he that looks upon me will take me without[3395]
    weighing: and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I[3396]
    cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these[3396][3397]
    costermonger times that true valour is turned bear-herd:
        pregnancy[3397][3398]
    is made a tapster, and hath his quick wit wasted in giving[3399]    160
    reckonings: all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the
    malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.[3400]
    You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are
    young; you do measure the heat of our livers with the[3401]
    bitterness of your galls: and we that are in the vaward of our      165
    youth, I must confess, are wags too.

    _Ch. Just._ Do you set down your name in the scroll of
    youth, that are written down old with all the characters of
    age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a yellow
    cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an increasing               170
    belly? is not your voice broken? your wind short? your[3402]
    chin double? your wit single? and every part about you[3402]
    blasted with antiquity? and will you yet call yourself[3403]
    young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!

    _Fal._ My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the[3404]    175
    afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly.[3404]
    For my voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing of[3405]
    anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not: the[3406]
    truth is, I am only old in judgement and understanding;
    and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let            180
    him lend me the money, and have at him. For the box of[3407]
    the ear that the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude[3407][3408]
    prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have checked
    him for it; and the young lion repents; marry, not in
    ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack.                  185

    _Ch. Just._ Well, God send the prince a better[3409]
    companion!

    _Fal._ God send the companion a better prince! I cannot[3409]
    rid my hands of him.

    _Ch. Just._ Well, the king hath severed you and Prince[3410]        190
    Harry: I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster[3410]
    against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.

    _Fal._ Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But[3411]
    look you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,
    that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the Lord, I[3412]    195
    take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat[3413]
    extraordinarily: if it be a hot day, and I brandish any[3414]
    thing but a bottle, I would I might never spit white again.[3415]
    There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head, but
    I am thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it
        was[3416][3417]                                                 200
    alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a[3417][3418]
    good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say[3417][3419]
    I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to[3417]
    God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is:[3417]
    I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to
        be[3417][3420]                                                  205
    scoured to nothing with perpetual motion.[3417]

    _Ch. Just._ Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless[3421]
    your expedition!

    _Fal._ Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
    furnish me forth?                                                   210

    _Ch. Just._ Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient
    to bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to
    my cousin Westmoreland.

                              [_Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant._[3422]

    _Fal._ If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man
    can no more separate age and covetousness than a' can[3423]         215
    part young limbs and lechery: but the gout galls the one,
    and the pox pinches the other; and so both the degrees[3424]
    prevent my curses. Boy!

    _Page._ Sir?

    _Fal._ What money is in my purse?                                   220

    _Page._ Seven groats and two pence.

    _Fal._ I can get no remedy against this consumption of
    the purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, but
    the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter to my Lord of
    Lancaster; this to the prince; this to the Earl of                  225
     Westmoreland; and this to old Mistress Ursula, whom I have
    weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white
    hair on my chin. About it: you know where to find me.[3425]
    [_Exit Page._] A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox![3426]
    for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe.[3427]   230
    'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars for my colour,[3428]
    and my pension shall seem the more reasonable. A good
    wit will make use of any thing: I will turn diseases to
    commodity.                                            [_Exit._[3429]


SCENE III. _York. The_ ARCHBISHOP'S _Palace_.

      _Enter the_ ARCHBISHOP, _the_ LORDS HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, _and_
                            BARDOLPH.[3430]

    _Arch._ Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;[3431]
    And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,[3432]
    Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
    And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?

    _Mowb._ I well allow the occasion of our arms;[3433]                  5
    But gladly would be better satisfied
    How in our means we should advance ourselves
    To look with forehead bold and big enough
    Upon the power and puissance of the king.

    _Hast._ Our present musters grow upon the file                       10
    To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
    And our supplies live largely in the hope[3434]
    Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
    With an incensed fire of injuries.

    _L. Bard._ The question then. Lord Hastings, standeth thus;          15
    Whether our present five and twenty thousand
    May hold up head without Northumberland?

    _Hast._ With him, we may.

    _L. Bard._                Yea, marry, there's the point:[3435]
    But if without him we be thought too feeble,
    My judgement is, we should not step too far                          20
    Till we had his assistance by the hand;[3436]
    For in a theme so bloody-faced as this[3436]
    Conjecture, expectation, and surmise[3436]
    Of aids incertain should not be admitted.[3436][3437]

    _Arch._ 'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed                    25
    It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.

    _L. Bard._ It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,
    Eating the air on promise of supply,[3438]
    Flattering himself in project of a power[3439]
    Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:                      30
    And so, with great imagination
    Proper to madmen, led his powers to death
    And winking leap'd into destruction.

    _Hast._ But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
    To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.                           35

    _L. Bard._ Yes, if this present quality of war,[3440][3441]
    Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot,[3440][3441]
    Lives so in hope, as in an early spring[3440][3441]
    We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,[3440]
    Hope gives not so much warrant as despair[3440]                      40
    That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,[3440]
    We first survey the plot, then draw the model;[3440]
    And when we see the figure of the house,[3440]
    Then must we rate the cost of the erection;[3440]
    Which if we find outweighs ability,[3440]                            45
    What do we then but draw anew the model;[3440]
    In fewer offices, or at least desist[3440][3442]
    To build at all? Much more, in this great work,[3440]
    Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down[3440]
    And set another up, should we survey[3440]                           50
    The plot of situation and the model,[3440][3443]
    Consent upon a sure foundation,[3440][3444]
    Question surveyors, know our own estate,[3440]
    How able such a work to undergo,[3440][3445]
    To weigh against his opposite; or else[3440][3446]                   55
    We fortify in paper and in figures,[3447]
    Using the names of men instead of men:
    Like one that draws the model of a house[3448]
    Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,[3449]
    Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost[3450]                    60
    A naked subject to the weeping clouds,
    And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.

    _Hast._ Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,
    Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd[3451]
    The utmost man of expectation,                                       65
    I think we are a body strong enough,[3452]
    Even as we are, to equal with the king.

    _L. Bard._ What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?

    _Hast._ To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.
    For his divisions, as the times do brawl,                            70
    Are in three heads: one power against the French,[3453]
    And one against Glendower; perforce a third
    Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
    In three divided; and his coffers sound
    With hollow poverty and emptiness.                                   75

    _Arch._ That he should draw his several strengths together
    And come against us in full puissance,
    Need not be dreaded.[3454]

    _Hast._              If he should do so,[3455]
    He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh[3455][3456]
    Baying him at the heels: never fear that.[3455][3456]                80

    _L. Bard._ Who is it like should lead his forces hither?

    _Hast._ The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
    Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:
    But who is substituted 'gainst the French,[3457]
    I have no certain notice.

    _Arch._                   Let us[3458]                               85
    And publish the occasion of our arms.[3458]
    The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;[3458][3459]
    Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:[3458][3459]
    An habitation giddy and unsure[3458]
    Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.[3458]                     90
    O thou fond many, with what loud applause[3458][3460]
    Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,[3458]
    Before he was what thou wouldst have him be![3458]
    And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,[3458][3461]
    Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,[3458]                      95
    That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.[3458]
    So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge[3458]
    Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;[3458]
    And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,[3458]
    And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times?[3458]         100
    They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,[3458][3462]
    Are now become enamour'd on his grave:[3458][3462]
    Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head[3458]
    When through proud London he came sighing on[3458]
    After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,[3458]                       105
    Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,[3458]
    And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed![3458]
    Past and to come seems best; things present, worst.[3458][3463]

    _Mowb._ Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?[3464]

    _Hast._ We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.              110

                                                        [_Exeunt._[3465]

ACT II.


SCENE I. _London. A street._

       _Enter_ Hostess, FANG _and his_ Boy _with her, and_ SNARE
                          _following_.[3466]

    _Host._ Master Fang, have you entered the action?[3467]

    _Fang._ It is entered.[3468]

    _Host._ Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman?[3469]
    will a' stand to't?[3470]

    _Fang._ Sirrah, where's Snare?                                        5

    _Host._ O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.[3471]

    _Snare._ Here, here.

    _Fang._ Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.

    _Host._ Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him[3472]
    and all.                                                             10

    _Snare._ It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he[3473]
    will stab.

    _Host._ Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me
    in mine own house, and that most beastly: in good faith,[3474]
    he cares not what mischief he does, if his weapon be out:[3475]      15
    he will foin like any devil; he will spare neither man,
    woman, nor child.

    _Fang._ If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.

    _Host._ No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.

    _Fang._ An I but fist him once; an a' come but within[3476]          20
    my vice,--[3477]

    _Host._ I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's[3478]
    an infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang, hold
    him sure: good Master Snare, let him not 'scape. A' comes[3479]
    continuantly to Pie-corner--saving your manhoods--to buy[3480]       25
    a saddle; and he is indited to dinner to the Lubber's-head
    in Lumbert street, to Master Smooth's the silkman: I pray[3481]
    ye, since my exion is entered and my case so openly[3482]
    known to the world, let him be brought in to his answer.
    A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to[3483]          30
    bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne; and have
    been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed off, from this[3484]
    day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There
    is no honesty in such dealing; unless a woman should be
    made an ass and a beast, to bear every knave's wrong.                35
    Yonder he comes; and that arrant malmsey-nose knave,[3485]
    Bardolph, with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master
    Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.[3486]

             _Enter_ FALSTAFF, Page, _and_ BARDOLPH.[3487]

    _Fal._ How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?

    _Fang._ Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress[3488][3489]   40
    Quickly.[3489]

    _Fal._ Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off the
    villain's head: throw the quean in the channel.[3490]

    _Host._ Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the[3490][3491]
    channel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly rogue![3491][3492]     45
    Murder, murder! Ah, thou honey-suckle villain! wilt thou[3493]
    kill God's officers and the king's? Ah, thou honey-seed[3493]
    rogue! thou art a honey-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.

    _Fal._ Keep them off, Bardolph.                                      50

    _Fang._ A rescue! a rescue!

    _Host._ Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't,[3494][3495]
    wo't thou? thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,[3495][3496]
    thou hemp-seed!

    _Fal._ Away, you scullion! you rampallian! you
        fustilarian![3497][3498]                                         55
    I'll tickle your catastrophe.

          _Enter the_ LORD CHIEF-JUSTICE, _and his men_.[3499]

    _Ch. Just._ What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho![3500]

    _Host._ Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you,
    stand to me.

    _Ch. Just._ How now, Sir John! what are you brawling
        here?[3501][3502]                                                60
    Doth this become your place, your time and business?[3502]
    You should have been well on your way to York.[3502]
    Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?[3502][3503]

    _Host._ O my most worshipful lord, an't please your
    grace, I am a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested            65
    at my suit.

    _Ch. Just._ For what sum?

    _Host._ It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,[3504]
    all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home; he[3504]
    hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his: but I          70
    will have some of it out again, or I will ride thee o'nights
    like the mare.

    _Fal._ I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have
    any vantage of ground to get up.

    _Ch. Just._ How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man[3505]            75
    of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
    Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough
    a course to come by her own?

    _Fal._ What is the gross sum that I owe thee?

    _Host._ Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the           80
    money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt[3506]
    goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber, at the round table, by
    a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when[3507]
    the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man[3508]
    of Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was                    85
    washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady thy
    wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the
    butcher's wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly?
    coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar; telling us she had
    a good dish of prawns; whereby thou didst desire to eat              90
    some; whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound?
    And didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs, desire[3509]
    me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people;[3510]
    saying that ere long they should call me madam? And didst
    thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings? I[3511]     95
    put thee now to thy book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.

    _Fal._ My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says[3512]
    up and down the town that her eldest son is like you: she
    hath been in good case, and the truth is, poverty hath distracted
    her. But for these foolish officers, I beseech you I                100
    may have redress against them.

    _Ch. Just._ Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted
    with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false
    way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words
    that come with such more than impudent sauciness from               105
    you, can thrust me from a level consideration: you have,[3513]
    as it appears to me, practised upon the easy-yielding spirit[3513]
    of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse[3513]
    and in person.[3513]

    _Host._ Yea, in truth, my lord.[3514]                               110

    _Ch. Just._ Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe[3515]
    her, and unpay the villany you have done her: the one[3516]
    you may do with sterling money, and the other with current
    repentance.

    _Fal._ My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without               115
    reply. You call honourable boldness impudent sauciness:
    if a man will make courtesy and say nothing, he is virtuous:[3517]
    no, my lord, my humble duty remembered, I will[3518]
    not be your suitor. I say to you, I do desire deliverance[3519]
    from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the[3520]       120
    king's affairs.

    _Ch. Just._ You speak as having power to do wrong:
    but answer in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy the[3521]
    poor woman.

    _Fal._ Come hither, hostess.                                        125

                          _Enter_ GOWER.[3522]

    _Ch. Just._ Now, Master Gower, what news?[3523]

    _Gow._ The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales[3524]
    Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.[3525]

    _Fal._ As I am a gentleman.

    _Host._ Faith, you said so before.[3526]                            130

    _Fal._ As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words
    of it.

    _Host._ By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be
    fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my
    dining-chambers.                                                    135

    _Fal._ Glasses, glasses, is the only drinking: and for thy
    walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of the Prodigal,
    or the German hunting in water-work, is worth a thousand[3527]
    of these bed-hangings and these fly-bitten tapestries. Let[3528]
    it be ten pound, if thou canst. Come, an 'twere not for[3529]       140
    thy humours, there's not a better wench in England. Go,[3530]
    wash thy face, and draw the action. Come, thou must not[3531]
    be in this humour with me; dost not know me? come,[3532]
    come, I know thou wast set on to this.

    _Host._ Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles:[3533]     145
    i' faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me, la![3534]

    _Fal._ Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be a[3535]
    fool still.

    _Host._ Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my[3536]
    gown. I hope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me                   150
    all together?[3537]

    _Fal._ Will I live? [_To Bardolph_] Go, with her, with[3538]
    her; hook on, hook on.

    _Host._ Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at
    supper?                                                             155

    _Fal._ No more words; let's have her.

                   [_Exeunt Hostess, Bardolph, Officers, and Boy._[3539]

    _Ch. Just._ I have heard better news.[3540]

    _Fal._ What's the news, my lord?[3541]

    _Ch. Just._ Where lay the king last night?[3542]

    _Gow._ At Basingstoke, my lord.[3543][3544]                         160

    _Fal._ I hope, my lord, all's well: what is the news, my
    lord?

    _Ch. Just._ Come all his forces back?

    _Gow._ No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,[3543][3545]
    Are march'd up to my lord of Lancaster,[3545]                       165
    Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.[3545]

    _Fal._ Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?

    _Ch. Just._ You shall have letters of me presently:
    Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.

    _Fal._ My lord![3546]                                               170

    _Ch. Just._ What's the matter?

    _Fal._ Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to[3547]
    dinner?

    _Gow._ I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank
    you, good Sir John.                                                 175

    _Ch. Just._ Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you[3548]
    are to take soldiers up in counties as you go.[3548][3549]

    _Fal._ Will you sup with me, Master Gower?

    _Ch. Just._ What foolish master taught you these
    manners, Sir John?                                                  180

    _Fal._ Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a
    fool that taught them me. This is the right fencing grace,
    my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.

    _Ch. Just._ Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great
    fool.                                             [_Exeunt._[3550]  185


SCENE II. _London. Another street._

                _Enter_ PRINCE HENRY _and_ POINS.[3551]

    _Prince._ Before God, I am exceeding weary.[3552]

    _Poins._ Is't come to that? I had thought weariness[3553]
    durst not have attached one of so high blood.

    _Prince._ Faith, it does me; though it discolours the[3554]
    complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it                 5
    not show vilely in me to desire small beer?

    _Poins._ Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied
    as to remember so weak a composition.

    _Prince._ Belike then my appetite was not princely got;
    for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,[3555]         10
    small beer. But, indeed, these humble considerations make
    me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it
    to me to remember thy name! or to know thy face
    tomorrow! or to take note how many pair of silk stockings[3556]
    thou hast, viz. these, and those that were thy peach-coloured[3557]  15
    ones! or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as, one for[3558]
    superfluity, and another for use! But that the[3559]
    tennis-court-keeper knows better than I; for it is a low ebb of
        linen with
    thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not[3560]
    done a great while, because the rest of thy low countries[3561]      20
    have made a shift to eat up thy holland: and God knows[3562][3563]
    whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall[3563][3564]
    inherit his kingdom: but the midwives say the children[3563]
    are not in the fault; whereupon the world increases, and[3563]
    kindreds are mightily strengthened.[3563]                            25

    _Poins._ How ill it follows, after you have laboured so
    hard, you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good
    young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as[3565]
    yours at this time is?[3566]

    _Prince._ Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?                        30

    _Poins._ Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.[3567]

    _Prince._ It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding
    than thine.

    _Poins._ Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that
    you will tell.[3568]                                                 35

    _Prince._ Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should[3569]
    be sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell to thee, as
    to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend,
    I could be sad, and sad indeed too.

    _Poins._ Very hardly upon such a subject.                            40

    _Prince._ By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the[3570]
    devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency:
    let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my heart
    bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick: and keeping such[3571]
    vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all            45
    ostentation of sorrow.

    _Poins._ The reason?[3572]

    _Prince._ What wouldst thou think of me, if I should
    weep?

    _Poins._ I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.               50

    _Prince._ It would be every man's thought; and thou art
    a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never a man's
    thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine:
    every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what
    accites your most worshipful thought to think so?[3573]              55

    _Poins._ Why, because you have been so lewd, and so[3574]
    much engraffed to Falstaff.

    _Prince._ And to thee.

    _Poins._ By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it[3575]
    with mine own ears: the worst that they can say of me is[3576]       60
    that I am a second brother, and that I am a proper fellow
    of my hands; and those two things, I confess, I cannot
    help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.[3577]

                   _Enter_ BARDOLPH _and_ Page.[3578]

    _Prince._ And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him[3579]
    from me Christian; and look, if the fat villain have not[3580]       65
    transformed him ape.

    _Bard._ God save your grace![3581]

    _Prince._ And yours, most noble Bardolph!

    _Bard._ Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must[3582]
    you be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a                     70
    maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a[3583]
    matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?

    _Page._ A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red[3584]
    lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from the
    window: at last I spied his eyes; and methought he had               75
    made two holes in the ale-wife's new petticoat and so[3585]
    peeped through.

    _Prince._ Has not the boy profited?[3586][3587]

    _Bard._ Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away![3586][3588]

    _Page._ Away, you rascally Althæa's dream, away!                     80

    _Prince._ Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?

    _Page._ Marry, my lord, Althæa dreamed she was[3589]
    delivered of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.

    _Prince._ A crown's worth of good interpretation: there
    'tis, boy.[3590]                                                     85

    _Poins._ O, that this good blossom could be kept from[3591]
    cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.

    _Bard._ An you do not make him hanged among you,[3592]
    the gallows shall have wrong.[3593]

    _Prince._ And how doth thy master, Bardolph?                         90

    _Bard._ Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming[3594]
    to town: there's a letter for you.

    _Poins._ Delivered with good respect. And how doth[3595]
    the martlemas, your master?

    _Bard._ In bodily health, sir.                                       95

    _Poins._ Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but
    that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies not.

    _Prince._ I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me
    as my dog; and he holds his place; for look you how he[3596]
    writes.                                                             100

    _Poins._ [_Reads_] '+John Falstaff, knight+,'--every man must[3597]
    know that, as oft as he has occasion to name himself: even[3598]
    like those that are kin to the king; for they never prick
    their finger but they say, 'There's some of the king's blood[3599]
    spilt.' 'How comes that?' says he, that takes upon him              105
    not to conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's[3600]
    cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'[3600]

    _Prince._ Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch[3601]
    it from Japhet. But to the letter:[3602]

    _Poins._ [_Reads_]
                 '+Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of the[3603]+  110
    +king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of Wales, greeting.+'
        Why,[3604]
    this is a certificate.

    _Prince._ Peace!

    _Poins._ [_Reads_] '+I will imitate the honourable Romans in[3605]+
    +brevity:+' he sure means brevity in breath, short-winded.
        '+I[3606]+                                                      115
    +commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I leave thee. Be not[3607]+
    +too familiar with Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he+
    +swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent at idle times as
        thou+
    +mayest; and so, farewell.+

            +'Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to say, as+     120
              +thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my+[3608]
              +familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters, and SIR+[3609]
              +JOHN with all Europe.'+

    My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack, and make him eat it.[3610]

    _Prince._ That's to make him eat twenty of his words.[3611]         125
    But do you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?

    _Poins._ God send the wench no worse fortune! But I[3612]
    never said so.

    _Prince._ Well, thus we play the fools with the time;[3613]
    and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.          130
    Is your master here in London?

    _Bard._ Yea, my lord.[3614]

    _Prince._ Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the[3615]
    old frank?

    _Bard._ At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.                    135

    _Prince._ What company?

    _Page._ Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.

    _Prince._ Sup any women with him?

    _Page._ None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and
    Mistress Doll Tearsheet.                                            140

    _Prince._ What pagan may that be?

    _Page._ A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of
    my master's.

    _Prince._ Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the[3616]
    town bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?                145

    _Poins._ I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.

    _Prince._ Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to
    your master that I am yet come to town: there's for your[3617]
    silence.

    _Bard._ I have no tongue, sir.                                      150

    _Page._ And for mine, sir, I will govern it.

    _Prince._ Fare you well; go. [_Exeunt Bardolph and Page._][3618]
    This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.[3619]

    _Poins._ I warrant you, as common as the way between
    Saint Alban's and London.                                           155

    _Prince._ How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night
    in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?[3620]

    _Poins._ Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and[3621]
    wait upon him at his table as drawers.[3622]

    _Prince._ From a God to a bull? a heavy descension! it[3623][3624]  160
    was Jove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a low[3624][3625]
    transformation! that shall be mine; for in every thing the[3624]
    purpose must weigh with the folly. Follow me, Ned.

                                                              [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _Warkworth. Before the castle._

           _Enter_ NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, _and_
                           LADY PERCY.[3626]

    _North._ I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,[3627]
    Give even way unto my rough affairs:[3628]
    Put not you on the visage of the times,
    And be like them to Percy troublesome.

    _Lady N._ I have given over, I will speak no more:[3629]              5
    Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.

    _North._ Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
    And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.

    _Lady P._ O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars![3630]
    The time was, father, that you broke your word,[3631]                10
    When you were more endear'd to it than now;[3632]
    When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,[3633]
    Threw many a northward look to see his father
    Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.[3634]
    Who then persuaded you to stay at home?                              15
    There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
    For yours, the God of heaven brighten it![3635]
    For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
    In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light
    Did all the chivalry of England move                                 20
    To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass
    Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:
    He had no legs that practised not his gait;[3636]
    And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,[3636]
    Became the accents of the valiant;[3636]                             25
    For those that could speak low and tardily[3636][3637]
    Would turn their own perfection to abuse,[3636]
    To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,[3636]
    In diet, in affections of delight,[3636]
    In military rules, humours of blood,[3636]                           30
    He was the mark and glass, copy and book,[3636]
    That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him![3636][3638]
    O miracle of men! him did you leave,[3636]
    Second to none, unseconded by you,[3636][3639]
    To look upon the hideous god of war[3636]                            35
    In disadvantage; to abide a field[3636][3640]
    Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name[3636]
    Did seem defensible: so you left him.[3636][3641]
    Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong[3636]
    To hold your honour more precise and nice[3636]                      40
    With others than with him! let them alone:[3636]
    The marshal and the archbishop are strong:[3636]
    Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,[3636][3642]
    To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,[3636]
    Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.[3636]

    _North._                         Beshrew your heart,                 45
    Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me
    With new lamenting ancient oversights.
    But I must go and meet with danger there,
    Or it will seek me in another place
    And find me worse provided.

    _Lady N._                   O, fly to Scotland,[3629][3643]          50
    Till that the nobles and the armed commons
    Have of their puissance made a little taste.

    _Lady P._ If they get ground and vantage of the king,[3644]
    Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,
    To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,                   55
    First let them try themselves. So did your son;
    He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;
    And never shall have length of life enough
    To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,
    That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,                       60
    For recordation to my noble husband.

    _North._ Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind
    As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,
    That makes a still-stand, running neither way:[3645]
    Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,                              65
    But many thousand reasons hold me back.[3646]
    I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,
    Till time and vantage crave my company.                   [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _London. The Boar's-head Tavern in Eastcheap._

                       _Enter two_ Drawers.[3647]

    _First Draw._ What the devil hast thou brought there?[3648]
    apple-johns? thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an
    apple-john.

    _Sec. Draw._ Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once[3649]
    set a dish of apple-johns before him, and told him there              5
    were five more Sir Johns; and, putting off his hat, said 'I
    will now take my leave of these six dry, round, old, withered[3650]
    knights.' It angered him to the heart: but he hath forgot
    that.

    _First Draw._ Why, then, cover, and set them down: and               10
    see if thou canst find out Sneak's noise; Mistress Tearsheet
    would fain hear some music. Dispatch: the room where[3651][3652]
    they supped is too hot; they'll come in straight.[3652]

    _Sec. Draw._ Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master[3652]
    Poins anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and              15
    aprons; and Sir John must not know of it: Bardolph hath
    brought word.[3653]

    _First Draw._ By the mass, here will be old utis: it will[3654]
    be an excellent stratagem.

    _Sec. Draw._ I'll see if I can find out Sneak.             [_Exit._  20

              _Enter_ HOSTESS _and_ DOLL TEARSHEET.[3655]

    _Host._ I'faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an[3656]
    excellent good temperality: your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily
    as heart would desire; and your colour, I warrant
    you, is as red as any rose, in good truth, la! But, i'[3657]
    faith, you have drunk too much canaries; and that's a[3658]          25
    marvellous searching wine, and it perfumes the blood ere
    one can say 'What's this?' How do you now?[3659]

    _Dol._ Better than I was: hem!

    _Host._ Why, that's well said; a good heart's worth[3660]
    gold. Lo, here comes Sir John.                                       30

                        _Enter_ FALSTAFF.[3661]

    _Fal._ [_Singing_] '+When Arthur first in court+'--Empty[3662]
    the jordan. [_Exit First Drawer_].--[_Singing_] '+And was
        a[3662][3663]+
    +worthy king.+' How now, Mistress Doll!

    _Host._ Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.[3664]

    _Fal._ So is all her sect; an they be once in a calm, they[3665]     35
    are sick.

    _Dol._ You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you[3666]
    give me?

    _Fal._ You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.

    _Dol._ I make them! gluttony and diseases make them;[3667]           40
    I make them not.

    _Fal._ If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help[3668]
    to make the diseases, Doll: we catch of you, Doll, we catch
    of you; grant that, my poor virtue, grant that.[3669]

    _Dol._ Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.[3670]                    45

    _Fal._ 'Your brooches, pearls, and ouches:' for to serve[3671]
    bravely is to come halting off, you know: to come off the
    breach with his pike bent bravely, and to surgery bravely;
    to venture upon the charged chambers bravely,--

    _Dol._ Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself![3672]         50

    _Host._ By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two[3673]
    never meet but you fall to some discord: you are both,
    i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts; you cannot[3674]
    one bear with another's confirmities. What the good-year![3675]
    one must bear, and that must be you: you are the weaker              55
    vessel, as they say, the emptier vessel.

    _Dol._ Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full
    hogshead? there's a whole merchant's venture of Bourdeaux
    stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk better stuffed in the
    hold. Come, I'll be friends with thee, Jack: thou art going          60
    to the wars; and whether I shall ever see thee again or no,
    there is nobody cares.

                     _Re-enter_ First Drawer.[3676]

    _First Draw._ Sir, Ancient Pistol's below, and would[3677]
    speak with you.

    _Dol._ Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come                 65
    hither: it is the foul-mouthedst rogue in England.

    _Host._ If he swagger, let him not come here: no, by my[3678]
    faith; I must live among my neighbours; I'll no swaggerers:[3678][3679]
    I am in good name and fame with the very best:
    shut the door; there comes no swaggerers here: I have                70
    not lived all this while, to have swaggering now: shut the
    door, I pray you.

    _Fal._ Dost thou hear, hostess?

    _Host._ Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John: there comes[3680]
    no swaggerers here.                                                  75

    _Fal._ Dost thou hear? it is mine ancient.

    _Host._ Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me: your ancient[3681]
    swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master
    Tisick, the debuty, t'other day; and, as he said to me, 'twas[3682]
    no longer ago than Wednesday last, 'I' good faith,[3683]             80
    neighbour Quickly,' says he; Master Dumbe, our minister, was[3684]
    by then; 'neighbour Quickly,' says he, 'receive those that
    are civil; for,' said he, 'you are in an ill name:' now a' said[3685]
    so, I can tell whereupon; 'for,' says he, 'you are an honest
    woman, and well thought on; therefore take heed what                 85
    guests you receive: receive,' says he, 'no swaggering
    companions.' There comes none here: you would bless you to[3686]
    hear what he said: no, I'll no swaggerers.

    _Fal._ He's no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater, i'[3687][3688]
    faith; you may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound:[3688]      90
    he'll not swagger with a Barbary hen, if her[3689]
    feathers turn back in any show of resistance. Call him
    up, drawer.                                    [_Exit First Drawer._

    _Host._ Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man
    my house, nor no cheater: but I do not love swaggering,              95
    by my troth; I am the worse, when one says swagger: feel,[3690]
    masters, how I shake; look you, I warrant you.[3691]

    _Dol._ So you do, hostess.

    _Host._ Do I? yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an[3692]
    aspen leaf: I cannot abide swaggerers.                              100

              _Enter_ PISTOL, BARDOLPH, _and_ Page.[3693]

    _Pist._ God save you, Sir John![3694]

    _Fal._ Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge
    you with a cup of sack: do you discharge upon mine
    hostess.

    _Pist._ I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two               105
    bullets.

    _Fal._ She is pistol-proof, sir; you shall hardly offend her.[3695]

    _Host._ Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets: I'll[3696]
    drink no more than will do me good, for no man's
    pleasure, I.                                                        110

    _Pist._ Then to you, Mistress Dorothy; I will charge you.

    _Dol._ Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What!
    you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away,
    you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for your master.

    _Pist._ I know you, Mistress Dorothy.                               115

    _Dol._ Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung,
    away! by this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy
    chaps, an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away, you[3697]
    bottle-ale rascal! you basket-hilt stale juggler, you! Since
    when, I pray you, sir? God's light, with two points on[3698]        120
    your shoulder? much![3699]

    _Pist._ God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff[3700]
    for this.

    _Fal._ No more, Pistol; I would not have you go off[3701]
    here: discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.[3701]              125

    _Host._ No, good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet captain.

    _Dol._ Captain! thou abominable damned cheater, art
    thou not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were[3702]
    of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for taking[3703]
    their names upon you before you have earned them. You               130
    a captain! you slave, for what? for tearing a poor whore's
    ruff in a bawdy-house? He a captain! hang him, rogue!
    he lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes. A
    captain! God's light, these villains will make the word as[3704][3705]
    odious as the word 'occupy;' which was an excellent good[3705]      135
    word before it was ill sorted: therefore captains had need[3705]
    look to't.[3706]

    _Bard._ Pray thee, go down, good ancient.

    _Fal._ Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.

    _Pist._ Not I: I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I               140
    could tear her: I'll be revenged of her.[3707]

    _Page._ Pray thee, go down.

    _Pist._ I'll see her damned first; to Pluto's damned[3708]
    lake, by this hand, to the infernal deep, with Erebus and[3708][3709]
    tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I. Down,[3708]          145
    down, dogs! down, faitors! Have we not Hiren here?[3708][3710]

    _Host._ Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late,[3711]
    i' faith: I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.[3712]

    _Pist._ These be good humours, indeed! Shall pack-horses,[3713]
    And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,[3713][3714]                      150
    Which cannot go but thirty mile a-day,[3713][3715]
    Compare with Cæsars, and with Cannibals,[3713][3716]
    And Trojan Greeks? nay, rather damn them with[3713][3717]
    King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.[3713]
    Shall we fall foul for toys?[3713]                                  155

    _Host._ By my troth, captain, these are very bitter words.

    _Bard._ Be gone, good ancient: this will grow to a brawl
    anon.

    _Pist._ Die men like dogs! give crowns like pins! Have[3718]
    we not Hiren here?                                                  160

    _Host._ O' my word, captain, there's none such here.[3719]
    What the good-year! do you think I would deny her? For[3720][3721]
    God's sake, be quiet.[3721]

    _Pist._ Then feed, and be fat, my fair Calipolis. Come,
    give's some sack.[3722]                                             165
    'Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contento.'[3723]
    Fear we broadsides? no, let the fiend give fire:[3724]
    Give me some sack: and, sweetheart, lie thou there.[3724]

                                   [_Laying down his sword._[3724][3725]

    Come we to full points here; and are etceteras nothing?[3724][3726]

    _Fal._ Pistol, I would be quiet.                                    170

    _Pist._ Sweet knight, I kiss thy neif: what! we have[3727]
    seen the seven stars.

    _Dol._ For God's sake, thrust him down stairs: I cannot[3728]
    endure such a fustian rascal.

    _Pist._ Thrust him down stairs! know we not Galloway                175
    nags?

    _Fal._ Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat[3729]
    shilling: nay, an a' do nothing but speak nothing, a' shall[3730]
    be nothing here.

    _Bard._ Come, get you down stairs.                                  180

    _Pist._ What! shall we have incision? shall we imbrue?[3731]

                                        [_Snatching up his sword._[3731]

    Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days![3731]
    Why, then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds[3731]
    Untwine the Sisters Three! Come, Atropos, I say![3731][3732]

    _Host._ Here's goodly stuff toward![3733]                           185

    _Fal._ Give me my rapier, boy.

    _Dol._ I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.[3734]

    _Fal._ Get you down stairs.

                               [_Drawing, and driving Pistol out._[3735]

    _Host._ Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping
    house, afore I'll be in these tirrits and frights. So; murder,      190
    I warrant now. Alas, alas! put up your naked weapons, put
    up your naked weapons.          [_Exeunt Pistol and Bardolph._[3736]

    _Dol._ I pray thee, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone.[3737]
    Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you!

    _Host._ Are you not hurt i' the groin? methought a'[3738]           195
    made a shrewd thrust at your belly.

                       _Re-enter_ BARDOLPH.[3739]

    _Fal._ Have you turned him out o' doors?[3740]

    _Bard._ Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk: you have hurt[3741]
    him, sir, i' the shoulder.[3742]

    _Fal._ A rascal! to brave me!                                       200

    _Dol._ Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! Alas, poor ape,
    how thou sweatest! come, let me wipe thy face; come on,
    you whoreson chops: ah, rogue! i' faith, I love thee:[3743]
    thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon,
    and ten times better than the Nine Worthies: ah,[3744]              205
    villain![3744]

    _Fal._ A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.[3745]

    _Dol._ Do, an thou darest for thy heart: an thou dost, I'll[3746][3747]
    canvass thee between a pair of sheets.[3746]

                             _Enter_ Music.

    _Page._ The music is come, sir.                                     210

    _Fal._ Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee,
    Doll. A rascal bragging slave! the rogue fled from me
    like quicksilver.

    _Dol._ I' faith, and thou followedst him like a church.[3748]
    Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig, when[3749]          215
    wilt thou leave fighting o' days and foining o' nights, and[3750]
    begin to patch up thine old body for heaven?

     _Enter, behind_, PRINCE HENRY _and_ POINS, _disguised_.[3751]

    _Fal._ Peace, good Doll! do not speak like a death's-head;[3752]
    do not bid me remember mine end.

    _Dol._ Sirrah, what humour's the prince of?[3753]                   220

    _Fal._ A good shallow young fellow: a' would have[3754]
    made a good pantler, a' would ha' chipped bread well.[3754][3755]

    _Dol._ They say Poins has a good wit.[3756]

    _Fal._ He a good wit? hang him, baboon! his wit's as[3753]
    thick as Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in[3753]        225
    him than is in a mallet.

    _Dol._ Why does the prince love him so, then?[3757]

    _Fal._ Because their legs are both of a bigness; and a'
    plays at quoits well; and eats conger and fennel; and
    drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons; and rides the            230
    wild-mare with the boys; and jumps upon joined-stools;
    and swears with a good grace; and wears his boots very[3758]
    smooth, like unto the sign of the leg; and breeds no bate
    with telling of discreet stories; and such other gambol[3759]
    faculties a' has, that show a weak mind and an able body,[3760]     235
    for the which the prince admits him: for the prince himself
    is such another; the weight of a hair will turn the scales[3761]
    between their avoirdupois.[3762]

    _Prince._ Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears
    cut off?                                                            240

    _Poins._ Let's beat him before his whore.[3763]

    _Prince._ Look, whether the withered elder hath not[3764]
    his poll clawed like a parrot.

    _Poins._ Is it not strange that desire should so many
    years outlive performance?                                          245

    _Fal._ Kiss me, Doll.

    _Prince._ Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction!
    what says the almanac to that?

    _Poins._ And, look, whether the fiery Trigon, his man,[3765]
    be not lisping to his master's old tables, his note-book,[3766]     250
    his counsel-keeper.

    _Fal._ Thou dost give me flattering busses.

    _Dol._ By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.[3767]

    _Fal._ I am old, I am old.

    _Dol._ I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young           255
    boy of them all.

    _Fal._ What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive[3768]
    money o' Thursday: shalt have a cap to-morrow. A[3769]
    merry song, come: it grows late; we'll to bed. Thou'lt[3770][3771]
    forget me when I am gone.                                           260

    _Dol._ By my troth, thou'lt set me a-weeping, an thou[3771][3772]
    sayest so: prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy
    return: well, hearken at the end.[3773]

    _Fal._ Some sack, Francis.

    _Prince._  }
    _Poins._   }  Anon, anon, sir.            [_Coming forward._[3774]  265

    _Fal._ Ha! a bastard son of the king's? And art not
    thou Poins his brother?[3775]

    _Prince._ Why, thou globe of sinful continents, what
    a life dost thou lead!

    _Fal._ A better than thou: I am a gentleman; thou                   270
    art a drawer.

    _Prince._ Very true, sir; and I come to draw you out
    by the ears.

    _Host._ O, the Lord preserve thy good grace! by my[3776][3777]
    troth, welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that[3777][3778]      275
    sweet face of thine! O Jesu, are you come from Wales?[3779]

    _Fal._ Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by[3780]
    this light flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.[3781]

    _Dol._ How, you fat fool! I scorn you.

    _Poins._ My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge             280
    and turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.

    _Prince._ You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely
    did you speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous,[3782]
    civil gentlewoman!

    _Host._ God's blessing of your good heart! and so she[3783]         285
    is, by my troth.[3784]

    _Fal._ Didst thou hear me?

    _Prince._ Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you[3785]
    ran away by Gad's-hill: you knew I was at your back, and
    spoke it on purpose to try my patience.                             290

    _Fal._ No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast
    within hearing.

    _Prince._ I shall drive you then to confess the wilful
    abuse; and then I know how to handle you.

    _Fal._ No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour; no abuse.[3786]               295

    _Prince._ Not to dispraise me, and call me pantler and[3787]
    bread-chipper and I know not what?[3788]

    _Fal._ No abuse, Hal.

    _Poins._ No abuse?

    _Fal._ No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none.               300
    I dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked might
    not fall in love with him; in which doing, I have done the[3789]
    part of a careful friend and a true subject, and thy father is[3790]
    to give me thanks for it. No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none:
    no, faith, boys, none.[3791]                                        305

    _Prince._ See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice
    doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close[3792]
    with us? is she of the wicked? is thine hostess here of the
    wicked? or is thy boy of the wicked? or honest Bardolph,[3793]
    whose zeal burns in his nose, of the wicked?                        310

    _Poins._ Answer, thou dead elm, answer.

    _Fal._ The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable;
    and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he doth
    nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy, there is a
    good angel about him; but the devil outbids him too.[3794]          315

    _Prince._ For the women?

    _Fal._ For one of them, she is in hell already, and burns[3795][3796]
    poor souls. For the other, I owe her money; and whether[3796]
    she be damned for that, I know not.

    _Host._ No, I warrant you.                                          320

    _Fal._ No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit
    for that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee, for
    suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house, contrary to the
    law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.

    _Host._ All victuallers do so: what's a joint of mutton[3797]       325
    or two in a whole Lent?

    _Prince._ You, gentlewoman,--

    _Dol._ What says your grace?

    _Fal._ His grace says that which his flesh rebels against.

                                               [_Knocking within._[3798]

    _Host._ Who knocks so loud at door? Look to the                     330
    door there, Francis.

                          _Enter_ PETO.[3799]

    _Prince._ Peto, how now! what news?[3800]

    _Peto._ The king your father is at Westminster;
    And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
    Come from the north: and, as I came along,                          335
    I met and overtook a dozen captains,
    Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,
    And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.

    _Prince._ By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,[3801]
    So idly to profane the precious time;                               340
    When tempest of commotion, like the south[3802]
    Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt,
    And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.
    Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.

                [_Exeunt Prince Henry, Poins, Peto, and Bardolph._[3803]

    _Fal._ Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and           345
    we must hence, and leave it unpicked. [_Knocking within._][3804]
    More knocking at the door!

                       _Re-enter_ BARDOLPH.[3805]

    How now! what's the matter?

    _Bard._ You must away to court, sir, presently;[3806]
    A dozen captains stay at door for you.[3806]                        350

    _Fal._ [_To the Page_] Pay the musicians, sirrah. Farewell,[3807]
    hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches, how

ACT III.


SCENE I. _Westminster. The palace._

        _Enter the_ KING _in his nightgown, with a_ Page.[3811]

    _King._ Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;
    But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,
    And well consider of them: make good speed.      [_Exit Page._[3812]
    How many thousand of my poorest subjects[3813]
    Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,[3814]               5
    Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
    That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down,
    And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
    Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
    Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,[3815]                           10
    And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,[3816]
    Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
    Under the canopies of costly state,[3817]
    And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?[3818]
    O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile                        15
    In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch
    A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?[3819]
    Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast[3820]
    Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
    In cradle of the rude imperious surge,                               20
    And in the visitation of the winds,
    Who take the ruffian billows by the top,[3821]
    Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
    With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,[3822]
    That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?                           25
    Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose[3823]
    To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude;[3824]
    And in the calmest and most stillest night,[3825]
    With all appliances and means to boot,
    Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down![3826]                   30
    Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

                  _Enter_ WARWICK _and_ SURREY.[3827]

    _War._ Many good morrows to your majesty![3828]

    _King._ Is it good morrow, lords?[3829]

    _War._ 'Tis one o'clock, and past.

    _King._ Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.[3830]           35
    Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?[3831]

    _War._ We have, my liege.

    _King._ Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
    How foul it is; what rank diseases grow,
    And with what danger, near the heart of it.                          40

    _War._ It is but as a body yet distemper'd;[3832]
    Which to his former strength may be restored
    With good advice and little medicine:
    My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.[3833]

    _King._ O God! that one might read the book of fate,[3834]           45
    And see the revolution of the times
    Make mountains level, and the continent,
    Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
    Into the sea! and, other times, to see
    The beachy girdle of the ocean                                       50
    Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,[3835]
    And changes fill the cup of alteration
    With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,[3836]
    The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,[3836][3837]
    What perils past, what crosses to ensue,[3836]                       55
    Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.[3836][3838]
    'Tis not ten years gone[3839]
    Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,[3840]
    Did feast together, and in two years after[3841]
    Were they at wars: it is but eight years since                       60
    This Percy was the man nearest my soul;
    Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs,
    And laid his love and life under my foot;
    Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
    Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--[3842]                   65
    You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--                [_To Warwick._
    When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,[3843]
    Then check'd and rated by Northumberland,
    Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?
    'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which                            70
    My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'
    Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,[3844]
    But that necessity so bow'd the state,
    That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:
    'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,[3845]                  75
    'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,[3845]
    Shall break into corruption:' so went on,[3846]
    Foretelling this same time's condition,
    And the division of our amity.

    _War._ There is a history in all men's lives,                        80
    Figuring the nature of the times deceased;[3847]
    The which observed, a man may prophesy,
    With a near aim, of the main chance of things
    As yet not come to life, which in their seeds[3848]
    And weak beginnings lie intreasured.[3849]                           85
    Such things become the hatch and brood of time;
    And by the necessary form of this[3850]
    King Richard might create a perfect guess
    That great Northumberland, then false to him,
    Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;                      90
    Which should not find a ground to root upon,
    Unless on you.

    _King._        Are these things then necessities?[3851]
    Then let us meet them like necessities:[3852]
    And that same word even now cries out on us:
    They say the bishop and Northumberland                               95
    Are fifty thousand strong.

    _War._                     It cannot be, my lord;[3853]
    Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,
    The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace
    To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,[3854]
    The powers that you already have sent forth                         100
    Shall bring this prize in very easily.[3855]
    To comfort you the more, I have received
    A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
    Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill;
    And these unseason'd hours perforce must add                        105
    Unto your sickness.

    _K. Hen._          I will take your counsel:
    And were these inward wars once out of hand,
    We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.           [_Exeunt._[3856]


SCENE II. _Gloucestershire. Before_ JUSTICE SHALLOW'S _house_.

    _Enter_ SHALLOW _and_ SILENCE, _meeting_; MOULDY, SHADOW, WART,
         FEEBLE, BULLCALF, _a Servant or two with them_.[3857]

    _Shal._ Come on, come on, come on, sir; give me your[3858]
    hand, sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, by the[3859]
    rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?[3859][3860]

    _Sil._ Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.

    _Shal._ And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and                   5
    your fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?

    _Sil._ Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow![3861]

    _Shal._ By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William[3862]
    is become a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?

    _Sil._ Indeed, sir, to my cost.                                      10

    _Shal._ A' must, then, to the inns o'court shortly: I was[3863]
    once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will talk of mad
    Shallow yet.

    _Sil._ You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.

    _Shal._ By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would[3864]       15
    have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too. There[3865]
    was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George
    Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, a Cotswold[3866][3867]
    man; you had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the inns[3867][3868]
    o'court again: and I may say to you, we knew where the[3869]         20
    bona-robas were and had the best of them all at[3870]
    commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and[3871]
    page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.

    _Sil._ This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about[3872]
    soldiers?                                                            25

    _Shal._ The same Sir John, the very same. I see him[3873]
    break Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a crack[3874]
    not thus high: and the very same day did I fight with one[3875]
    Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray's Inn. Jesu,[3876]
    Jesu, the mad days that I have spent! and to see how many[3876]      30
    of my old acquaintance are dead![3877]

    _Sil._ We shall all follow, cousin.

    _Shal._ Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,
    as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall die. How[3878]
    a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?[3879]                      35

    _Sil._ By my troth, I was not there.[3880]

    _Shal._ Death is certain. Is old Double of your town
    living yet?

    _Sil._ Dead, sir.

    _Shal._ Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and[3881]              40
    dead! a' shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well,[3882]
    and betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have
    clapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carried you a fore-hand
    shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half, that it would[3883]
    have done a man's heart good to see. How a score of ewes             45
    now?

    _Sil._ Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may
    be worth ten pounds.

    _Shal._ And is old Double dead?

    _Sil._ Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.         50

               _Enter_ BARDOLPH _and one with him_.[3884]

    _Bard._ Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you,[3885]
    which is Justice Shallow?

    _Shal._ I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this
    county, and one of the king's justices of the peace: what is[3886]
    your good pleasure with me?[3887]                                    55

    _Bard._ My captain, sir, commends him to you; my
    captain, Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and a[3888]
    most gallant leader.

    _Shal._ He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword[3889]
    man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how                         60
    my lady his wife doth?

    _Bard._ Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated[3890]
    than with a wife.

    _Shal._ It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said[3891]
    indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea, indeed,[3892]      65
    is it: good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.[3893]
    Accommodated! it comes of 'accommodo:'[3892]
    very good; a good phrase.

    _Bard._ Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase[3894]
    call you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase; but[3895]      70
    I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier-like
    word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven.[3896]
    Accommodated; that is, when a man is, as they say, accommodated;[3892]
    or when a man is, being, whereby a' may be[3892][3897]
    thought to be accommodated; which is an excellent thing.[3892][3897] 75

    _Shal._ It is very just.

                        _Enter_ FALSTAFF.[3898]

    Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good hand,[3899]
    give me your worship's good hand: by my troth, you like[3900]
    well and bear your years very well: welcome, good Sir
    John.                                                                80

    _Fal._ I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert
    Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?[3901]

    _Shal._ No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission[3902]
    with me.

    _Fal._ Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be[3902]       85
    of the peace.

    _Sil._ Your good worship is welcome.

    _Fal._ Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you[3903]
    provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?[3904]

    _Shal._ Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?                           90

    _Fal._ Let me see them, I beseech you.

    _Shal._ Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the
    roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so, so,[3905]
    so, so: yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as[3906]
    I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me see; where            95
    is Mouldy?

    _Moul._ Here, an't please you.[3907]

    _Shal._ What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;
    young, strong, and of good friends.

    _Fal._ Is thy name Mouldy?                                          100

    _Moul._ Yea, an't please you.[3908]

    _Fal._ 'Tis the more time thou wert used.

    _Shal._ Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! things that[3909]
    are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith, well[3910]
    said, Sir John; very well said.                                     105

    _Fal._ Prick him.[3911]

    _Moul._ I was pricked well enough before, an you could[3912]
    have let me alone: my old dame will be undone now, for
    one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need not
    to have pricked me; there are other men fitter to go out            110
    than I.

    _Fal._ Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it
    is time you were spent.

    _Moul._ Spent!

    _Shal._ Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you                 115
    where you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:[3913][3914]
    Simon Shadow![3914]

    _Fal._ Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's[3915]
    like to be a cold soldier.

    _Shal._ Where's Shadow?                                             120

    _Shad._ Here, sir.

    _Fal._ Shadow, whose son art thou?

    _Shad._ My mother's son, sir.

    _Fal._ Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's
    shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of the male:         125
    it is often so, indeed; but much of the father's substance![3916]

    _Shal._ Do you like him, Sir John?

    _Fal._ Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we[3917]
    have a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.[3918]

    _Shal._ Thomas Wart!                                                130

    _Fal._ Where's he?

    _Wart._ Here, sir.

    _Fal._ Is thy name Wart?

    _Wart._ Yea, sir.

    _Fal._ Thou art a very ragged wart.                                 135

    _Shal._ Shall I prick him down, Sir John?[3919]

    _Fal._ It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon[3920]
    his back, and the whole frame stands upon pins: prick him
    no more.

    _Shal._ Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I            140
    commend you well. Francis Feeble!

    _Fee._ Here, sir.

    _Fal._ What trade art thou, Feeble?

    _Fee._ A woman's tailor, sir.

    _Shal._ Shall I prick him, sir?                                     145

    _Fal._ You may: but if he had been a man's tailor,
    he'ld ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an[3921]
    enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?

    _Fee._ I will do my good will, sir: you can have no more.

    _Fal._ Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,                   150
    courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful
    dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the woman's
    tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.[3922]

    _Fee._ I would Wart might have gone, sir.

    _Fal._ I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst          155
    mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him to a[3923]
    private soldier, that is the leader of so many thousands: let
    that suffice, most forcible Feeble.

    _Fee._ It shall suffice, sir.[3924]

    _Fal._ I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is                  160
    next?[3925]

    _Shal._ Peter Bullcalf o' the green!

    _Fal._ Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.

    _Bull._ Here, sir.

    _Fal._ 'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me[3926]             165
    Bullcalf till he roar again.

    _Bull._ O Lord! good my lord captain,--[3927]

    _Fal._ What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?[3928]

    _Bull._ O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.[3927]

    _Fal._ What disease hast thou?                                      170

    _Bull._ A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught
    with ringing in the king's affairs upon his coronation-day,
    sir.

    _Fal._ Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we
    will have away thy cold; and I will take such order that            175
    thy friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?

    _Shal._ Here is two more called than your number; you[3929]
    must have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in with
    me to dinner.

    _Fal._ Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot                 180
    tarry dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master[3930]
    Shallow.

    _Shal._ O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all
    night in the windmill in Saint George's field?[3931]

    _Fal._ No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more[3932]          185
    of that.[3932]

    _Shal._ Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane
    Nightwork alive?

    _Fal._ She lives, Master Shallow.

    _Shal._ She never could away with me.[3933]                         190

    _Fal._ Never, never; she would always say she could not
    abide Master Shallow.

    _Shal._ By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She[3934]
    was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?

    _Fal._ Old, old, Master Shallow.                                    195

    _Shal._ Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be
    old; certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old
    Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.[3935]

    _Sil._ That's fifty five year ago.[3936]

    _Shal._ Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that               200
    that this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I
    well?

    _Fal._ We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master
    Shallow.

    _Shal._ That we have, that we have, that we have; in[3937]          205
    faith, Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'[3938]
    Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner: Jesus, the[3939]
    days that we have seen! Come, come.

                              [_Exeunt Falstaff and the Justices._[3940]

    _Bull._ Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my
    friend; and here's four Harry ten shillings in French               210
    crowns for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be hanged,
    sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir, I do not care;
    but rather, because I am unwilling, and, for mine own part,
    have a desire to stay with my friends; else, sir, I did not
    care, for mine own part, so much.                                   215

    _Bard._ Go to; stand aside.

    _Moul._ And, good master corporal captain, for my old[3941]
    dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do any[3942]
    thing about her when I am gone; and she is old, and cannot
    help herself: you shall have forty, sir.[3943]                      220

    _Bard._ Go to; stand aside.

    _Fee._ By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once:[3944]
    we owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind: an't[3945][3946]
    be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is too good to[3946]
    serve's prince; and let it go which way it will, he that dies[3947] 225
    this year is quit for the next.

    _Bard._ Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.[3948]

    _Fee._ Faith, I'll bear no base mind.

             _Re-enter_ FALSTAFF _and the_ Justices.[3949]

    _Fal._ Come, sir, which men shall I have?

    _Shal._ Four of which you please.                                   230

    _Bard._ Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to
    free Mouldy and Bullcalf.

    _Fal._ Go to; well.

    _Shal._ Come, Sir John, which four will you have?

    _Fal._ Do you choose for me.                                        235

    _Shal._ Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and
    Shadow.[3950]

    _Fal._ Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at[3951]
    home till you are past service: and for your part, Bullcalf,[3952]
    grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.                     240

    _Shal._ Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they
    are your likeliest men, and I would have you served with
    the best.

    _Fal._ Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose
    a man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature, bulk,          245
    and big assemblance of a man! Give me the spirit, Master[3953]
    Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a ragged appearance[3954]
    it is: a' shall charge you and discharge you with the
    motion of a pewterer's hammer, come off and on swifter than
    he that gibbets on the brewer's bucket. And this same               250
    half-faced fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no
    mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim
    level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat; how[3955]
    swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run off! O, give
    me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a             255
    caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.

    _Bard._ Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.[3956]

    _Fal._ Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well:
    go to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a
    little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i' faith,
        Wart;[3957]                                                     260
    thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a tester for thee.[3957]

    _Shal._ He is not his craft's-master; he doth not do it[3958]
    right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at Clement's
    Inn,--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's
    show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a' would manage
        you[3959]                                                       265
    his piece thus; and a' would about and about, and come[3959]
    you in and come you in: 'rah, tah, tah,' would a' say;[3959]
    'bounce' would a' say; and away again would a' go, and[3959]
    again would a' come: I shall ne'er see such a fellow.[3959][3960]

    _Fal._ These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God[3961][3962]  270
    keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words
        with[3961][3962][3963]
    you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank you: I must[3962]
    a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give the soldiers coats.

    _Shal._ Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your[3964]
    affairs! God send us peace! At your return visit our[3965][3966]    275
    house; let our old acquaintance be renewed: peradventure[3966]
    I will with ye to the court.[3967]

    _Fal._ 'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.[3968]

    _Shal._ Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.[3969]

    _Fal._ Fare you well, gentle gentlemen. [_Exeunt[3970]_             280
    _Justices._] On, Bardolph; lead the men away. [_Exeunt[3971]
    Bardolph, Recruits, &c._] As I return, I will fetch off these
    justices: I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord,[3972]
    Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying![3972]
    This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to[3973]      285
    me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done
    about Turnbull Street; and every third word a lie, duer[3974]
    paid to the hearer than the Turk's tribute. I do remember
    him at Clement's Inn like a man made after supper of a
    cheese-paring: when a' was naked, he was, for all the               290
    world, like a forked radish, with a head fantastically carved
    upon it with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his dimensions
    to any thick sight were invincible: a' was the very genius[3975]
    of famine; yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores[3976]
    called him mandrake: a' came ever in the rearward of
        the[3976][3977]                                                 295
    fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives[3978][3979]
    that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his[3978]
    fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger[3978][3980]
    become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt[3981]
    as if he had been sworn brother to him; and I'll be sworn           300
    a' ne'er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard; and then he[3982]
    burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men.[3983]
    I saw it, and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name;
    for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an[3984]
    eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for            305
    him, a court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll[3985]
    be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall go hard[3986]
    but I will make him a philosopher's two stones to me:[3987]
    if the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no
    reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him. Let[3988]        310
    time shape, and there an end.                         [_Exit._[3989]

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _Yorkshire. Gaultree Forest._

 _Enter the_ ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, HASTINGS, _and others_.[3990]

    _Arch._ What is this forest call'd?[3991]

    _Hast._ 'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.[3992]

    _Arch._ Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth
    To know the numbers of our enemies.[3993]

    _Hast._ We have sent forth already.

    _Arch._                              'Tis well done.                  5
    My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
    I must acquaint you that I have received
    New-dated letters from Northumberland;
    Their cold intent, tenour and substance, thus:[3994]
    Here doth he wish his person, with such powers[3995]                 10
    As might hold sortance with his quality,
    The which he could not levy; whereupon
    He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,
    To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers
    That your attempts may overlive the hazard                           15
    And fearful meeting of their opposite.

    _Mowb._ Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
    And dash themselves to pieces.

                       _Enter a_ Messenger.[3996]

    _Hast._                        Now, what news?

    _Mess._ West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
    In goodly form comes on the enemy;                                   20
    And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
    Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.

    _Mowb._ The just proportion that we gave them out.
    Let us sway on and face them in the field.[3997]

    _Arch._ What well-appointed leader fronts us here?                   25

                      _Enter_ WESTMORELAND.[3998]

    _Mowb._ I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.

    _West._ Health and fair greeting from our general,
    The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.

    _Arch._ Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:[3999]
    What doth concern your coming?[3999]

    _West._                        Then, my[4000]                        30
    Unto your grace do I in chief address
    The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
    Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
    Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,[4001]
    And countenanced by boys and beggary,                                35
    I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,[4002]
    In his true, native and most proper shape,
    You, reverend father, and these noble lords
    Had not been here, to dress the ugly form[4003]
    Of base and bloody insurrection                                      40
    With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,[4004]
    Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd,[4005]
    Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,
    Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,
    Whose white investments figure innocence,[4006]                      45
    The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,
    Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself
    Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,
    Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
    Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,[4007]               50
    Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
    To a loud trumpet and a point of war?[4008]

    _Arch._ Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
    Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,
    And with our surfeiting and wanton hours[4009]                       55
    Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,[4009]
    And we must bleed for it; of which disease[4009]
    Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.[4009]
    But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,[4009]
    I take not on me here as a physician,[4009]                          60
    Nor do I as an enemy to peace[4009]
    Troop in the throngs of military men;[4009]
    But rather show awhile like fearful war,[4009]
    To diet rank minds sick of happiness[4009]
    And purge the obstructions which begin to stop[4009]                 65
    Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.[4009]
    I have in equal balance justly weigh'd[4009]
    What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer.[4009]
    And find our griefs heavier than our offences.[4009]
    We see which way the stream of time doth run,[4009]                  70
    And are enforced from our most quiet there[4009][4010]
    By the rough torrent of occasion;[4009]
    And have the summary of all our griefs,[4009]
    When time shall serve, to show in articles;[4009]
    Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,[4009]                    75
    And might by no suit gain our audience:[4009][4011]
    When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,[4009]
    We are denied access unto his person[4009]
    Even by those men that most have done us wrong.[4009]
    The dangers of the days but newly gone,[4012]                        80
    Whose memory is written on the earth
    With yet appearing blood, and the examples
    Of every minute's instance, present now,[4013]
    Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,[4014]
    Not to break peace or any branch of it,                              85
    But to establish here a peace indeed,
    Concurring both in name and quality.

    _West._ When ever yet was your appeal denied?
    Wherein have you been galled by the king?
    What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,                        90
    That you should seal this lawless bloody book
    Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
    And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?[4015]

    _Arch._ My brother general, the commonwealth,[4016]
    To brother born an household cruelty;[4017]                          95
    I make my quarrel in particular.

    _West._ There is no need of any such redress;
    Or if there were, it not belongs to you.

    _Mowb._ Why not to him in part, and to us all
    That feel the bruises of the days before,                           100
    And suffer the condition of these times
    To lay a heavy and unequal hand[4018][4019]
    Upon our honours?[4018]

    _West._           O, my good Lord Mowbray,[4020]
    Construe the times to their necessities,[4020]
    And you shall say indeed, it is the time,[4020]                     105
    And not the king, that doth you injuries.[4020]
    Yet for your part, it not appears to me[4020]
    Either from the king or in the present time[4020][4021]
    That you should have an inch of any ground[4020]
    To build a grief on: were you not restored[4020]                    110
    To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,[4020]
    Your noble and right well remember'd father's?[4020]

    _Mowb._ What thing, in honour, had my father lost,[4020]
    That need to be revived and breathed in me?[4020]
    The king that loved him, as the state stood then,[4020]             115
    Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:[4020][4022]
    And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he,[4020][4023][4024]
    Being mounted and both roused in their seats,[4020][4024]
    Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,[4020][4024][4025]
    Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,[4020][4024]       120
    Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel[4020][4024][4026]
    And the loud trumpet blowing them together,[4020][4024]
    Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd[4020][4024]
    My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,[4020][4024]
    O, when the king did throw his warder down,[4020][4024][4027]       125
    His own life hung upon the staff he threw;[4020]
    Then threw he down himself and all their lives[4020]
    That by indictment and by dint of sword[4020][4028]
    Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.[4020]

    _West._ You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.[4020]       130
    The Earl of Hereford was reputed then[4020][4029]
    In England the most valiant gentleman:[4020]
    Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?[4020]
    But if your father had been victor there,[4020]
    He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:[4020]                        135
    For all the country in a general voice[4020]
    Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love[4020][4030]
    Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on[4020][4031]
    And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.[4020][4032]
    But this is mere digression from my purpose.[4033]                  140
    Here come I from our princely general
    To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace
    That he will give you audience; and wherein
    It shall appear that your demands are just,[4034]
    You shall enjoy them, every thing set off[4034]                     145
    That might so much as think you enemies.[4035]

    _Mowb._ But he hath forced us to compel this offer;
    And it proceeds from policy, not love.

    _West._ Mowbray, you overween to take it so;
    This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:                         150
    For, lo! within a ken our army lies,
    Upon mine honour, all too confident
    To give admittance to a thought of fear.
    Our battle is more full of names than yours,
    Our men more perfect in the use of arms,                            155
    Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;
    Then reason will our hearts should be as good:[4036]
    Say you not then our offer is compell'd.

    _Mowb._ Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.[4037]

    _West._ That argues but the shame of your offence:                  160
    A rotten case abides no handling.[4038]

    _Hast._ Hath the Prince John a full commission,
    In very ample virtue of his father,
    To hear and absolutely to determine
    Of what conditions we shall stand upon?                             165

    _West._ That is intended in the general's name:[4039]
    I muse you make so slight a question.

    _Arch._ Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,
    For this contains our general grievances:
    Each several article herein redress'd,                              170
    All members of our cause, both here and hence,[4040]
    That are insinewed to this action,[4040][4041]
    Acquitted by a true substantial form,[4040]
    And present execution of our wills[4040][4042]
    To us and to our purposes confined,[4043]                           175
    We come within our awful banks again,[4044]
    And knit our powers to the arm of peace.[4045]

    _West._ This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
    In sight of both our battles we may meet;[4046]
    And either end in peace, which God so frame![4046][4047]            180
    Or to the place of difference call the swords
    Which must decide it.
    Which must decide it.

    _Arch._               My lord, we will do so.          [_Exit West._

    _Mowb._ There is a thing within my bosom tells me[4048]
    That no conditions of our peace can stand.[4049]

    _Hast._ Fear you not that: if we can make our peace[4050]           185
    Upon such large terms and so absolute
    As our conditions shall consist upon,[4051]
    Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.

    _Mowb._ Yea, but our valuation shall be such[4052]
    That every slight and false-derived cause,                          190
    Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason
    Shall to the king taste of this action;
    That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,[4053]
    We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
    That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff                     195
    And good from bad find no partition.

    _Arch._ No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary[4054]
    Of dainty and such picking grievances:[4054][4055]
    For he hath found to end one doubt by death
    Revives two greater in the heirs of life,                           200
    And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
    And keep no tell-tale to his memory
    That may repeat and history his loss
    To new remembrance; for full well he knows
    He cannot so precisely weed this land                               205
    As his misdoubts present occasion:
    His foes are so enrooted with his friends
    That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
    He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.[4056]
    So that this land, like an offensive wife                           210
    That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,[4057]
    As he is striking, holds his infant up
    And hangs resolved correction in the arm
    That was uprear'd to execution.

    _Hast._ Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods                  215
    On late offenders, that he now doth lack
    The very instruments of chastisement:
    So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
    May offer, but not hold.

    _Arch._                  'Tis very true:
    And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,                     220
    If we do now make our atonement well,
    Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
    Grow stronger for the breaking.

    _Mowb._                         Be it so.[4058]
    Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.[4058]

                     _Re-enter_ WESTMORELAND.[4059]

    _West._ The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship          225
    To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.

    _Mowb._ Your grace of York, in God's name, then, set forward.[4060]

    _Arch._ Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come. [_Exeunt._[4061]


SCENE II. _Another part of the forest._

    _Enter, from one side,_ MOWBRAY, _attended; afterwards the_
        ARCHBISHOP, HASTINGS, _and others: from the other side_,
        PRINCE JOHN of LANCASTER, _and_ WESTMORELAND; Officers, _and
        others with them_.[4062]

    _Lan._ You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:[4063]
    Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;[4064]
    And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
    My Lord of York, it better show'd with you
    When that your flock, assembled by the bell,                          5
    Encircled you to hear with reverence
    Your exposition on the holy text
    Than now to see you here an iron man,[4065]
    Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
    Turning the word to sword and life to death.                         10
    That man that sits within a monarch's heart,
    And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
    Would he abuse the countenance of the king,
    Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach
    In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,                  15
    It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
    How deep you were within the books of God?[4066]
    To us the speaker in his parliament;
    To us the imagined voice of God himself;[4067]
    The very opener and intelligencer                                    20
    Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven
    And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
    But you misuse the reverence of your place,
    Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,[4068]
    As a false favourite doth his prince's name,                         25
    In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,[4069]
    Under the counterfeited zeal of God,[4070]
    The subjects of his substitute, my father,[4071]
    And both against the peace of heaven and him
    Have here up-swarm'd them.

    _Arch._                    Good my Lord of Lancaster,                30
    I am not here against your father's peace;
    But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland,
    The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,[4072]
    Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,
    To hold our safety up. I sent your grace                             35
    The parcels and particulars of our grief,
    The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,[4073]
    Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;[4074]
    Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
    With grant of our most just and right desires,[4075]                 40
    And true obedience, of this madness cured,
    Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.

    _Mowb._ If not, we ready are to try our fortunes
    To the last man.

    _Hast._          And though we here fall down,
    We have supplies to second our attempt:                              45
    If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
    And so success of mischief shall be born[4076]
    And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up[4077]
    Whiles England shall have generation.[4078]

    _Lan._ You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,[4079]        50
    To sound the bottom of the after-times.

    _West._ Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
    How far forth you do like their articles.

    _Lan._ I like them all, and do allow them well;
    And swear here, by the honour of my blood,                           55
    My father's purposes have been mistook;
    And some about him have too lavishly
    Wrested his meaning and authority.
    My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;
    Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,[4080]              60
    Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
    As we will ours: and here between the armies
    Let's drink together friendly and embrace,
    That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
    Of our restored love and amity.                                      65

    _Arch._ I take your princely word for these redresses.[4081][4082]

    _Lan._ I give it you, and will maintain my word:[4081]
    And thereupon I drink unto your grace.[4083]

    _Hast._ Go, captain, and deliver to the army[4084]
    This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:                     70
    I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.

                                                  [_Exit Officer._[4085]

    _Arch._ To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.[4086]

    _West._ I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains[4087]
    I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,[4087]
    You would drink freely: but my love to ye[4088]                      75
    Shall show itself more openly hereafter.

    _Arch._ I do not doubt you.

    _West._                     I am glad of it.
    Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.

    _Mowb._ You wish me health in very happy season;
    For I am, on the sudden, something ill.                              80

    _Arch._ Against ill chances men are ever merry;
    But heaviness foreruns the good event.

    _West._ Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow
    Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes to-morrow.'[4089]

    _Arch._ Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.                    85

    _Mowb._ So much the worse, if your own rule be true.

                                                 [_Shouts within._[4090]

    _Lan._ The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout![4091]

    _Mowb._ This had been cheerful after victory.

    _Arch._ A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
    For then both parties nobly are subdued,                             90
    And neither party loser.

    _Lan._                   Go, my lord,
    And let our army be discharged too.      [_Exit Westmoreland._[4092]
    And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains[4093]
    March by us, that we may peruse the men
    We should have coped withal.

    _Arch._                      Go, good Lord Hastings,                 95
    And, ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by. [_Exit Hastings._[4094]

    _Lan._ I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.

                     _Re-enter_ WESTMORELAND.[4095]

    Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?[4096]

    _West._ The leaders, having charge from you to stand,
    Will not go off until they hear you speak.                          100

    _Lan._ They know their duties.

                       _Re-enter_ HASTINGS.[4097]

    _Hast._ My lord, our army is dispersed already:[4098]
    Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses[4099]
    East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,
    Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.[4100]              105

    _West._ Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
    I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:
    And you, lord archbishop, and you, lord Mowbray,
    Of capital treason I attach you both.

    _Mowb._ Is this proceeding just and honourable?                     110

    _West._ Is your assembly so?

    _Arch._ Will you thus break your faith?

    _Lan._                                  I pawn'd thee none:[4101]
    I promised you redress of these same grievances[4102]
    Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,
    I will perform with a most Christian care.                          115
    But for you, rebels, look to taste the due
    Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.[4103]
    Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
    Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.
    Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:                    120
    God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.[4104]
    Some guard these traitors to the block of death,[4105]
    Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.              [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _Another part of the forest._

 _Alarum. Excursions. Enter_ FALSTAFF _and_ COLEVILE, _meeting_.[4106]

    _Fal._ What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,
    and of what place, I pray?[4107]

    _Cole._ I am a knight, sir; and my name is Colevile of[4108]
    the dale.[4108]

    _Fal._ Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your            5
    degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be still your
    name, a traitor your degree, and the dungeon your place,[4109]
    a place deep enough; so shall you be still Colevile of the[4110]
    dale.

    _Cole._ Are not you Sir John Falstaff?                               10

    _Fal._ As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye
    yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are
    the drops of thy lovers, and they weep for thy death: therefore
    rouse up fear and trembling, and do observance to my
    mercy.                                                               15

    _Cole._ I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that
    thought yield me.

    _Fal._ I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of
    mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word
    but my name. An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I             20
    were simply the most active fellow in Europe: my womb,
    my womb, my womb, undoes me. Here comes our general.

         _Enter_ PRINCE JOHN of LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT,
                          _and others_.[4111]

    _Lan._ The heat is past; follow no further now:[4112]
    Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.  [_Exit Westmoreland._

    Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?                   25
    When every thing is ended, then you come:[4113]
    These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,
    One time or other break some gallows' back.

    _Fal._ I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus:
    I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of              30
    valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet?
    have I, in my poor and old motion, the expedition of
    thought? I have speeded hither with the very extremest[4114]
    inch of possibility; I have foundered nine score and odd[4115]
    posts: and here, travel-tainted as I am, have, in my pure            35
    and immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the
    dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy. But
    what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I may justly
    say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome, 'I came, saw, and[4116]
    overcame.'                                                           40

    _Lan._ It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.

    _Fal._ I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and
    I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the rest of this
    day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will have it in a particular[4117]   45
    ballad else, with mine own picture on the top on't, Colevile[4118]
    kissing my foot: to the which course if I be enforced, if you
    do not all show like gilt two-pences to me, and I in the
    clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon
    doth the cinders of the element, which show like pins' heads         50
    to her, believe not the word of the noble: therefore let me
    have right, and let desert mount.

    _Lan._ Thine's too heavy to mount.

    _Fal._ Let it shine, then.

    _Lan._ Thine's too thick to shine.                                   55

    _Fal._ Let it do something, my good lord, that may do
    me good, and call it what you will.

    _Lan._ Is thy name Colevile?

    _Cole._ It is, my lord.

    _Lan._ A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.                            60

    _Fal._ And a famous true subject took him.

    _Cole._ I am, my lord, but as my betters are
    That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,
    You should have won them dearer than you have.[4119]

    _Fal._ I know not how they sold themselves: but thou,                65
    like a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I thank[4120]
    thee for thee.

                     _Re-enter_ WESTMORELAND.[4121]

    _Lan._ Now, have you left pursuit?[4122]

    _West._ Retreat is made and execution stay'd.

    _Lan._ Send Colevile with his confederates[4123]                     70
    To York, to present execution:
    Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.

                         [_Exeunt Blunt and others with Colevile._[4124]

    And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:
    I hear the king my father is sore sick:
    Our news shall go before us to his majesty,                          75
    Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him;
    And we with sober speed will follow you.

    _Fal._ My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go[4125][4126]
    Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,[4125]
    Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.[4125][4127]           80

    _Lan._ Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,[4128]
    Shall better speak of you than you deserve.[4128]

                                    [_Exeunt all except Falstaff._[4129]

    _Fal._ I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than[4130]
    your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded
    boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make him laugh;[4131]         85
    but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine. There's never none[4132]
    of these demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth[4133]
    so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that[4133]
    they fall into a kind of male green-sickness; and then, when
    they marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools and           90
    cowards; which some of us should be too, but for inflammation.
    A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It
    ascends me into the brain; dries me there all the foolish and[4134]
    dull and crudy vapours which environ it; makes it
        apprehensive,[4134][4135]
    quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and delectable                95
    shapes; which, delivered o'er to the voice, the tongue, which[4136]
    is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of[4137]
    your excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood; which,
    before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which
    is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris        100
    warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts
    extreme: it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives[4138]
    warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm;
    and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster
    me all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed           105
    up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this[4139]
    valour comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
    nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and learning
    a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences[4140]
    it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince          110
    Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit
    of his father, he hath, like lean sterile and bare land,
    manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour
    of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he
    is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons,           115
    the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to[4141]
    forswear thin potations, and to addict themselves to sack.

                        _Enter_ BARDOLPH.[4142]

    How now, Bardolph?

    _Bard._ The army is discharged all and gone.

    _Fal._ Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and               120
    there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire: I have him
    already tempering between my finger and my thumb, and
    shortly will I seal with him. Come away.            [_Exeunt._[4143]


SCENE IV. _Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber._

        _Enter the_ KING, _the_ PRINCES THOMAS of CLARENCE _and_
          HUMPHREY of GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, _and others_.[4144]

    _King._ Now, lords, if God doth give successful end[4145]
    To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,[4146]
    We will our youth lead on to higher fields
    And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
    Our navy is address'd, our power collected,                           5
    Our substitutes in absence well invested,
    And every thing lies level to our wish:
    Only, we want a little personal strength;
    And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,
    Come underneath the yoke of government.                              10

    _War._ Both which we doubt not but your majesty
    Shall soon enjoy.

    _King._           Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,[4147]
    Where is the prince your brother?[4147]

    _Glou._ I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.

    _King._ And how accompanied?

    _Glou._                     I do not know, my lord.                  15

    _King._ Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?

    _Glou._ No, my good lord; he is in presence here.

    _Clar._ What would my lord and father?

    _King._ Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
    How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?                 20
    He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;
    Thou hast a better place in his affection
    Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,
    And noble offices thou mayst effect
    Of mediation, after I am dead,                                       25
    Between his greatness and thy other brethren:
    Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,
    Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
    By seeming cold or careless of his will;
    For he is gracious, if he be observed:                               30
    He hath a tear for pity and a hand
    Open as day for melting charity:[4148]
    Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,
    As humorous as winter and as sudden[4149]
    As flaws congealed in the spring of day.[4150]                       35
    His temper, therefore, must be well observed:
    Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,
    When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth;
    But, being moody, give him line and scope,[4151]
    Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,                      40
    Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
    And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
    A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
    That the united vessel of their blood,
    Mingled with venom of suggestion--                                   45
    As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--
    Shall never leak, though it do work as strong[4152]
    As aconitum or rash gunpowder.

    _Clar._ I shall observe him with all care and love.

    _King._ Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?                50

    _Clar._ He is not there to-day; he dines in London.[4153]

    _King._ And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?[4154]

    _Clar._ With Poins, and other his continual followers.[4153]

    _King._ Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
    And he, the noble image of my youth,                                 55
    Is overspread with them: therefore my grief
    Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:
    The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
    In forms imaginary the unguided days
    And rotten times that you shall look upon                            60
    When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
    For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
    When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,
    When means and lavish manners meet together,
    O, with what wings shall his affections fly                          65
    Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!

    _War._ My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:
    The prince but studies his companions
    Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
    'Tis needful that the most immodest word                             70
    Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,
    Your highness knows, comes to no further use[4155]
    But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
    The prince will in the perfectness of time
    Cast off his followers; and their memory                             75
    Shall as a pattern or a measure live,
    By which his grace must mete the lives of others,[4156]
    Turning past evils to advantages.

    _King._ 'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb[4157]
    In the dead carrion.

                      _Enter_ WESTMORELAND.[4158]

                         Who's here? Westmoreland?                       80

    _West._ Health to my sovereign, and new happiness[4159]
    Added to that that I am to deliver![4160]
    Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:
    Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all[4161]
    Are brought to the correction of your law;                           85
    There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd,
    But Peace puts forth her olive every where.
    The manner how this action hath been borne
    Here at more leisure may your highness read,
    With every course in his particular.[4162]                           90

    _King._ O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
    Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
    The lifting up of day.

                        _Enter_ HARCOURT.[4163]

                           Look, here's more news.

    _Har._ From enemies heaven keep your majesty;[4164]
    And, when they stand against you, may they fall                      95
    As those that I am come to tell you of!
    The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,
    With a great power of English and of Scots,
    Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:[4165]
    The manner and true order of the fight,                             100
    This packet, please it you, contains at large.[4166]

    _King._ And wherefore should these good news make me sick?[4167]
    Will Fortune never come with both hands full,
    But write her fair words still in foulest letters?[4168]
    She either gives a stomach and no food;                             105
    Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast
    And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,[4169]
    That have abundance and enjoy it not.
    I should rejoice now at this happy news;
    And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:                      110
    O me! come near me; now I am much ill.[4170]

    _Glou._ Comfort, your majesty![4171]

    _Clar._                        O my royal father!

    _West._ My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.

    _War._ Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits
    Are with his highness very ordinary.                                115
    Stand from him, give him air; he'll straight be well.[4172]

    _Clar._ No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:[4173]
    The incessant care and labour of his mind
    Hath wrought the mure, that should confine it in,
    So thin that life looks through and will break out.[4174]           120

    _Glou._ The people fear me; for they do observe[4175]
    Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:[4176]
    The seasons change their manners, as the year
    Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.[4177]

    _Clar._ The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;               125
    And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,
    Say it did so a little time before
    That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.[4178]

    _War._ Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.

    _Glou._ This apoplexy will ceitain be his end.[4179]                130

    _King._ I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence
    Into some other chamber: softly, pray.[4180]


SCENE V. _Another Chamber._

       _The_ KING lying on a bed: CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK,
                   _and others in attendance_.[4181]

    _King._ Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;
    Unless some dull and favourable hand[4182]
    Will whisper music to my weary spirit.

    _War._ Call for the music in the other room.

    _King._ Set me the crown upon my pillow here.                         5

    _Clar._ His eye is hollow, and he changes much.

    _War._ Less noise, less noise!

                      _Enter_ PRINCE HENRY.[4183]

    _Prince._                      Who saw the Duke of Clarence?

    _Clar._ I am here, brother, full of heaviness.

    _Prince._ How now! rain within doors, and none abroad![4184]
    How doth the king?[4184]                                             10

    _Glou._ Exceeding ill.

    _Prince._              Heard he the good news yet?[4185]
    Tell it him.[4185][4186]

    _Glou._        He alter'd much upon the hearing it.[4187]

    _Prince._ If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without[4188][4189]
    physic.[4188]                                                        15

    _War._ Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince, speak low;[4190]
    The king your father is disposed to sleep.

    _Clar._ Let us withdraw into the other room.

    _War._ Will't please your grace to go along with us?

    _Prince._ No; I will sit and watch here by the king.                 20

                                  [_Exeunt all except the Prince._[4191]

    Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,
    Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
    O polish'd perturbation! golden care!
    That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
    To many a watchful night! sleep with it now![4192]                   25
    Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet[4193]
    As he whose brow with homely biggen bound[4194]
    Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
    When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
    Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,                              30
    That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath[4195]
    There lies a downy feather which stirs not:[4196]
    Did he suspire, that light and weightless down[4197]
    Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father![4198]
    This sleep is sound indeed; this is a sleep,                         35
    That from this golden rigol hath divorced[4199]
    So many English kings. Thy due from me[4200]
    Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,
    Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,
    Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:                          40
    My due from thee is this imperial crown,[4201]
    Which, as immediate from thy place and blood,
    Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,[4202]
    Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength[4203][4204]
    Into one giant arm, it shall not force[4203]                         45
    This lineal honour from me: this from thee[4203]
    Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.[4203]      [_Exit._

    _King._ Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!

    _Re-enter_ WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, _and the rest_.[4205]

    _Clar._ Doth the king call?

    _War._ What would your majesty? How fares your grace?[4206]          50

    _King._ Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?

    _Clar._ We left the prince my brother here, my liege,[4207]
    Who undertook to sit and watch by you.[4207]

    _King._ The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:[4207]
    He is not here.[4207][4208]                                          55

    _War._ This door is open; he is gone this way.[4209]

    _Glou._ He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.

    _King._ Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?

    _War._ When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.

    _King._ The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.[4210]      60
    Is he so hasty that he doth suppose[4210]
    My sleep my death?[4210]
    Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.[4210]

                                                  [_Exit Warwick._[4210]

    This part of his conjoins with my disease,[4210]
    And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are![4210]           65
    How quickly nature falls into revolt
    When gold becomes her object![4211]
    For this the foolish over-careful fathers
    Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with
        care,[4212][4213]
    Their bones with industry;[4212]                                     70
    For this they have engrossed and piled up[4214]
    The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;
    For this they have been thoughtful to invest
    Their sons with arts and martial exercises:
    When, like the bee, culling from every flower[4215]                  75
    The virtuous sweets,[4216][4217][4218]
    Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,[4217][4218][4219]
    We bring it to the hive; and, like the bees,[4218][4220]
    Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste[4218]
    Yield his engrossments to the ending father.[4218]                   80

                       _Re-enter_ WARWICK.[4221]

    Now, where is he that will not stay so long
    Till his friend sickness hath determined me?[4222]

    _War._ My lord, I found the prince in the next room,
    Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,
    With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow                           85
    That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,
    Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife
    With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.

    _King._ But wherefore did he take away the crown?

                     _Re-enter_ PRINCE HENRY.[4223]

    Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.                        90
    Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.

                                   [_Exeunt Warwick and the rest._[4224]

    _Prince._ I never thought to hear you speak again.

    _King._ Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:
    I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
    Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair[4225]                       95
    That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours[4226]
    Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!
    Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee.
    Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity
    Is held from falling with so weak a wind                            100
    That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.
    Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
    Were thine without offence; and at my death
    Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:
    Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,                          105
    And thou wilt have me die assured of it.
    Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,[4227]
    Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,[4228]
    To stab at half an hour of my life.[4229]
    What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?                       110
    Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,
    And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear[4230]
    That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
    Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
    Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:                              115
    Only compound me with forgotten dust;
    Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
    Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
    For now a time is come to mock at form:
    Harry the fifth is crown'd: up, vanity![4231]                       120
    Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!
    And to the English court assemble now,
    From every region, apes of idleness!
    Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:
    Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,[4232]             125
    Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
    The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?[4233]
    Be happy, he will trouble you no more;
    England shall double gild his treble guilt,[4234]
    England shall give him office, honour, might;                       130
    For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks[4235]
    The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
    Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.[4236]
    O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
    When that my care could not withhold thy riots,                     135
    What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
    O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,
    Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!

    _Prince._ O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,[4237]
    The moist impediments unto my speech,[4238]                         140
    I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
    Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
    The course of it so far. There is your crown;[4239]
    And He that wears the crown immortally
    Long guard it yours! If I affect it more                            145
    Than as your honour and as your renown,
    Let me no more from this obedience rise,
    Which my most inward true and duteous spirit[4240]
    Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.[4241][4242]
    God witness with me, when I here came in,[4242]                     150
    And found no course of breath within your majesty,
    How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
    O, let me in my present wildness die
    And never live to show the incredulous world
    The noble change that I have purposed!                              155
    Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
    And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
    I spake unto this crown as having sense,[4243]
    And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
    Hath fed upon the body of my father;                                160
    Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:[4244]
    Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,[4245]
    Preserving life in medicine potable;
    But thou, most fine, most honour'd, most renown'd,
    Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,[4246]           165
    Accusing it, I put it on my head,
    To try with it, as with an enemy
    That had before my face murder'd my father,
    The quarrel of a true inheritor.
    But if it did infect my blood with joy,                             170
    Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
    If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
    Did with the least affection of a welcome
    Give entertainment to the might of it,[4247]
    Let God for ever keep it from my head[4248]                         175
    And make me as the poorest vassal is
    That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!

    _King._ O my son,[4249]
    God put it in thy mind to take it hence,[4248][4250]
    That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,[4251]             180
    Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
    Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;
    And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
    That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,[4248]
    By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways[4252]                    185
    I met this crown; and I myself know well
    How troublesome it sat upon my head.
    To thee it shall descend with better quiet,
    Better opinion, better confirmation;
    For all the soil of the achievement goes                            190
    With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
    But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,
    And I had many living to upbraid
    My gain of it by their assistances;
    Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,[4253]                 195
    Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears[4254]
    Thou see'st with peril I have answered;
    For all my reign hath been but as a scene
    Acting that argument: and now my death
    Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,[4255]               200
    Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;[4256]
    So thou the garland wear'st successively.[4257]
    Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
    Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
    And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,[4258]         205
    Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;[4259]
    By whose fell working I was first advanced
    And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
    To be again displaced: which to avoid,
    I cut them off; and had a purpose now[4260]                         210
    To lead out many to the Holy Land,[4261]
    Lest rest and lying still might make them look
    Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,[4262]
    Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
    With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,[4263]          215
    May waste the memory of the former days.[4264]
    More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
    That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
    How I came by the crown, O God forgive;[4248][4265]
    And grant it may with thee in true peace live![4265]                220

    _Prince._ My gracious liege,[4266]
    You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;
    Then plain and right must my possession be:
    Which I with more than with a common pain
    'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.                     225

                 _Enter_ LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER.[4267]

    _King._ Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.[4268]

    _Lan._ Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father![4269]

    _King._ Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;[4270]
    But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown
    From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight                       230
    My worldly business makes a period.
    Where is my Lord of Warwick?

    _Prince._                    My Lord of Warwick!

                  _Enter_ WARWICK, _and others_.[4271]

    _King._ Doth any name particular belong
    Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?

    _War._ 'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.                        235

    _King._ Laud be to God! even there my life must end.[4248][4272]
    It hath been prophesied to me many years,
    I should not die but in Jerusalem;
    Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land:
    But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;                        240
    In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.                  [_Exeunt._[4273]

ACT V.


SCENE I. _Gloucestershire._ SHALLOW'S _house_.

         _Enter_ SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, _and_ PAGE.[4274]

    _Shal._ By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.[4275]
    What, Davy, I say!

    _Fal._ You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.

    _Shal._ I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;
    excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse shall serve;        5
    you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!

                             _Enter_ DAVY.

    _Davy._ Here, sir.

    _Shal._ Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let[4276]
    me see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook, bid[4277]
    him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.                 10

    _Davy._ Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:
    and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?[4278]

    _Shal._ With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook:
    are there no young pigeons?

    _Davy._ Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for
        shoeing[4279][4280]                                              15
    and plough-irons.[4280]

    _Shal._ Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not
    be excused.

    _Davy._ Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be[4281]
    had: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's wages,           20
    about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley fair?[4282]

    _Shal._ A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple
    of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little
    tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.[4283]

    _Davy._ Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?                     25

    _Shal._ Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the[4284]
    court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men well,
    Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.

    _Davy._ No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they[4285]
    have marvellous foul linen.[4286]                                    30

    _Shal._ Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.

    _Davy._ I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor
    of Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.[4287]

    _Shal._ There is many complaints, Davy, against that[4288]
    Visor: that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.               35

    _Davy._ I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but
    yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance[4289]
    at his friend's request. An honest man, sir, is able to
    speak for himself, when a knave is not. I have served your
    worship truly, sir, this eight years; and if I cannot once[4290]     40
    or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest
    man, I have but a very little credit with your worship.[4291]
    The knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I beseech
    your worship, let him be countenanced.[4292]

    _Shal._ Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look[4293]              45
    about, Davy. [_Exit Davy_] Where are you, Sir John?[4293][4294]
    Come, come, come, off with your boots. Give me your[4293][4295]
    hand, Master Bardolph.[4293]

    _Bard._ I am glad to see your worship.

    _Shal._ I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master[4296]            50
    Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow [_to the Page._][4297]
    Come, Sir John.

    _Fal._ I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.     [_Exit[4298]
    Shallow._] Bardolph, look to our horses. [_Exeunt Bardolph[4298][4299]
    and Page._] If I were sawed into quantities, I should make[4299]     55
    four dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master Shallow.[4300]
    It is a wonderful thing to see the sembable coherence of
    his men's spirits and his: they, by observing of him, do bear[4301]
    themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them,
    is turned into a justice-like serving-man: their spirits are so      60
    married in conjunction with the participation of society that
    they flock together in consent, like so many wild-geese. If I[4302]
    had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with
    the imputation of being near their master: if to his men, I
    would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better             65
    command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing
    or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of
    another: therefore let men take heed of their company. I
    will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince
    Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions,[4303]   70
    which is four terms, or two actions, and a' shall laugh[4304]
    without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight[4305]
    oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that
    never had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see
    him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!             75

    _Shal._ [_Within_] Sir John![4306]

    _Fal._ I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.

                                                          [_Exit._[4307]


SCENE II. _Westminster. The palace._

     _Enter_ WARWICK _and the_ LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, _meeting_.[4308]

    _War._ How now, my lord chief justice! whither away?[4309]

    _Ch. Just._ How doth the king?

    _War._ Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.[4310]

    _Ch. Just._ I hope, not dead.

    _War._                        He's walk'd the way of nature;
    And to our purposes he lives no more.                                 5

    _Ch. Just._ I would his majesty had call'd me with him:
    The service that I truly did his life
    Hath left me open to all injuries.

    _War._ Indeed I think the young king loves you not.

    _Ch. Just._ I know he doth not, and do arm myself                    10
    To welcome the condition of the time,
    Which cannot look more hideously upon me[4311]
    Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.

         _Enter_ LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WESTMORELAND,
                          _and others_.[4312]

    _War._ Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:
    O that the living Harry had the temper                               15
    Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen![4313]
    How many nobles then should hold their places,
    That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!

    _Ch. Just._ O God, I fear all will be overturn'd![4314]

    _Lan._ Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.[4315]               20

    _Glou._  }  Good morrow, cousin.[4316]
    _Clar._  }

    _Lan._ We meet like men that had forgot to speak.

    _War._ We do remember; but our argument
    Is all too heavy to admit much talk.

    _Lan._ Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy!              25

    _Ch. Just._ Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!

    _Glou._ O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;[4317]
    And I dare swear you borrow not that face
    Of sceming sorrow, it is sure your own.

    _Lan._ Though no man be assured what grace to find,                  30
    You stand in coldest expectation:
    I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.

    _Clar._ Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;
    Which swims against your stream of quality.

    _Ch. Just._ Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,              35
    Led by the impartial conduct of my soul;[4318]
    And never shall you see that I will beg
    A ragged and forestall'd remission.[4319][4320]
    If truth and upright innocency fail me,[4320][4321]
    I'll to the king my master that is dead,                             40
    And tell him who hath sent me after him.

    _War._ Here comes the prince.

            _Enter_ KING HENRY _the fifth, attended_.[4322]

    _Ch. Just._ Good morrow; and God save your majesty![4323]

    _King._ This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,[4324]
    Sits not so easy on me as you think.                                 45
    Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:[4325]
    This is the English, not the Turkish court;
    Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,[4326]
    But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,
    For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:[4327]                    50
    Sorrow so royally in you appears
    That I will deeply put the fashion on
    And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;
    But entertain no more of it, good brothers,
    Than a joint burden laid upon us all.                                55
    For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,
    I'll be your father and your brother too;
    Let me but bear your love. I'll bear your cares:
    Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;[4328]
    But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears                      60
    By number into hours of happiness.

    _Princes._ We hope no other from your majesty.[4329]

    _King._ You all look strangely on me: and you most;[4330]
    You are, I think, assured I love you not.

    _Ch. Just._ I am assured, if I be measured rightly,                  65
    Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.

    _King._ No![4331]
    How might a prince of my great hopes forget[4331]
    So great indignities you laid upon me?[4332]
    What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison                       70
    The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?
    May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?[4333]

    _Ch. Just._ I then did use the person of your father;
    The image of his power lay then in me:
    And, in the administration of his law,                               75
    Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
    Your highness pleased to forget my place,
    The majesty and power of law and justice,
    The image of the king whom I presented,
    And struck me in my very seat of judgement;                          80
    Whereon, as an offender to your father,
    I gave bold way to my authority,
    And did commit you. If the deed were ill,[4334]
    Be you contented, wearing now the garland,[4334]
    To have a son set your decrees at nought,[4335]                      85
    To pluck down justice from your awful bench.[4335]
    To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
    That guards the peace and safety of your person;[4335]
    Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image
    And mock your workings in a second body.[4335]                       90
    Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
    Be now the father and propose a son,
    Hear your own dignity so much profaned,
    See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
    Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;                               95
    And then imagine me taking your part[4336]
    And in your power soft silencing your son:[4337]
    After this cold considerance, sentence me;
    And, as you are a king, speak in your state
    What I have done that misbecame my place,                           100
    My person, or my liege's sovereignty.

    _King._ You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;
    Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:
    And I do wish your honours may increase,
    Till you do live to see a son of mine                               105
    Offend you, and obey you, as I did.
    So shall I live to speak my father's words:
    'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,
    That dares do justice on my proper son;
    And not less happy, having such a son,[4338]                        110
    That would deliver up his greatness so
    Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:[4339]
    For which, I do commit into your hand
    The unstained sword that you have used to bear;
    With this remembrance, that you use the same                        115
    With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit
    As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.
    You shall be as a father to my youth:
    My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,
    And I will stoop and humble my intents                              120
    To your well-practised wise directions.
    And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;
    My father is gone wild into his grave,[4340][4341]
    For in his tomb lie my affections;[4340]
    And with his spirit sadly I survive,[4342]                          125
    To mock the expectation of the world,
    To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
    Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down[4343]
    After my seeming. The tide of blood in me[4344]
    Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:                             130
    Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
    Where it shall mingle with the state of floods[4345]
    And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
    Now call we our high court of parliament:
    And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,                      135
    That the great body of our state may go
    In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;
    That war, or peace, or both at once, may be
    As things acquainted and familiar to us;
    In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.[4346]               140
    Our coronation done, we will accite,
    As I before remember'd, all our state:
    And, God consigning to my good intents,[4347]
    No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
    God shorten Harry's happy life one day!           [_Exeunt._[4348]  145

    Sir John: marry, good air. Spread, Davy; spread, Davy:

    serving-man and your husband.[4354]

    _Shal._ A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet,
    Sir John: by the mass, I have drunk too much sack at[4355]

    I'll give you a health for that anon.[4365]

    _Shal._ Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.[4366]                  25

    _Davy._ Sweet sir, sit; I'll be with you anon; most
    sweet sir, sit. Master page, good master page, sit. Proface![4367]

    _Fal._ I did not think Master Silence had been a man of
    this mettle.[4374]

    _Sil._ Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere
    now.                                                                 40

    thing, and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart. Welcome, my             55
    little tiny thief [_to the Page_], and welcome indeed too. I'll[4385]
    drink to Master Bardolph, and to all the cavaleros about[4386]
    London.

    _Davy._ I hope to see London once ere I die.[4387]

    _Bard._ An I might see you there, Davy,--[4388]                      60

    _Shal._ By the mass, you'll crack a quart together, ha![4389]
    will you not, Master Bardolph?

    _Bard._ Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.[4390]

    _Shal._ By God's liggens, I thank thee: the knave will[4391]
    stick by thee, I can assure thee that. A' will not out;
        he[4392][4393]                                                   65

    merry. [_Knocking within._] Look who's at door there, ho![4394]

                            [_To Silence, seeing him take off a bumper._

    _Sil._     +Do me right.+[4397][4398]                    [_Singing._

    _Fal._ 'Tis so.

    _Sil._ Is't so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.[4399]

                         _Re-enter_ DAVY.[4400]

    _Davy._ An't please your worship, there's one Pistol[4401]
    come from the court with news.                                       80

    _Fal._ From the court! let him come in.

                         _Enter_ PISTOL.[4402]

    How now, Pistol![4403]

    _Pist._ Sir John, God save you![4404]

    _Fal._ What wind blew you hither, Pistol?

    _Pist._ Not the ill wind which blows no man to good.[4405]           85
    Sweet knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in
    this realm.[4406]

    _Sil._ By'r lady, I think a' be, but goodman Puff of[4407]
    Barson.[4408]

    _Pist._ Puff!                                                        90
    Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base![4409]
    Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,[4409]
    And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,[4409][4410]
    And tidings do I bring and lucky joys[4409]
    And golden times and happy news of price.[4409]                      95

    _Fal._ I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this[4411]
    world.

    _Pist._ A foutre for the world and worldlings base![4412][4413]
    I speak of Africa and golden joys.[4413]

    _Fal._ O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?[4413]              100
    Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.[4413][4414]

    _Sil._ +And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.+[4413][4415]  [_Singing._

    _Pist._ Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons?[4413]
    And shall good news be baffled?[4413]
    Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.[4413][4416]              105

    _Shal._ Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.[4417]

    _Pist._ Why then, lament therefore.

    _Shal._ Give me pardon, sir: if, sir, you come with news[4418]
    from the court, I take it there's but two ways, either to[4419]
    utter them, or to conceal them. I am, sir, under the king,[4420]    110
    in some authority.

    _Pist._ Under which king, Besonian? speak, or die.[4421]

    _Shal._ Under King Harry.

    _Pist._                   Harry the fourth? or fifth?

    _Shal._ Harry the fourth.

    _Pist._                  A foutre for thine office![4422]
    Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king;[4423]                     115
    Harry the fifth's the man. I speak the truth:[4423]
    When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like[4423]
    The bragging Spaniard.[4423]

    _Fal._ What, is the old king dead?

    _Pist._ As nail in door: the things I speak are just.[4424]         120

    _Fal._ Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master[4425]
    Robert Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land,[4425]
    'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.[4425]

    _Bard._ O joyful day!
    I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.[4426]                 125

    _Pist._ What! I do bring good news.[4427]

    _Fal._ Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow,
    my Lord Shallow,--be what thou wilt; I am fortune's
    steward--get on thy boots: we'll ride all night. O sweet[4428]
    Pistol! Away, Bardolph! [_Exit Bard._] Come, Pistol, utter[4429]    130
    more to me; and withal devise something to do thyself
    good. Boot, boot, Master Shallow: I know the young[4430]
    king is sick for me. Let us take any man's horses; the
    laws of England are at my commandment. Blessed are[4431]
    they that have been my friends; and woe to my lord
        chief-justice![4431][4432]                                      135

    _Pist._ Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also!
    'Where is the life that late I led?' say they:[4433]
    Why, here it is; welcome these pleasant days!       [_Exeunt._[4434]

                           TEARSHEET.[4435]

    _Host._ No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I[4436]
    might die, that I might have thee hanged: thou hast drawn
    my shoulder out of joint.

    _First Bead._ The constables have delivered her over to[4437]
    me; and she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant[4438]         5
    her: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her.[4439]

    _Dol._ Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I'll tell[4440]
    thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an the child[4441]
    I now go with do miscarry, thou wert better thou hadst[4442]
    struck thy mother, thou paper-faced villain.                         10

    _Host._ O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would[4443]
    make this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the[4444]
    fruit of her womb miscarry![4445]

    _First Bead._ If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions
    again; you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both              15
    go with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat
    amongst you.[4446]

    _Dol._ I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I[4447]
    will have you as soundly swinged for this,--you blue-bottle[4448]
    rogue, you filthy famished correctioner, if you be not               20
    swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.

    _First Bead._ Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.[4449]

    _Host._ O God, that right should thus overcome might![4450]
    Well, of sufferance comes ease.

    _Dol._ Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.                 25

    _Host._ Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.[4451]

    _Dol._ Goodman death, goodman bones!

    _Host._ Thou atomy, thou![4452]

    _Dol._ Come, you thin thing; come, you rascal.

    _First Bead._ Very well.                                 [_Exeunt._  30


SCENE V. _A public place near Westminster Abbey._

              _Enter two_ Grooms, _strewing rushes_.[4453]

    _First Groom._ More rushes, more rushes.[4454]

    _Sec. Groom._ The trumpets have sounded twice.

    _First Groom._ 'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from[4455]
    the coronation: dispatch, dispatch.                       [_Exeunt._

     _Enter_ FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL, BARDOLPH _and_ Page.[4456]

    _Fal._ Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will[4457]          5
    make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as a'
    comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he will
    give me.

    _Pist._ God bless thy lungs, good knight.[4458]

    _Fal._ Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had               10
    had time to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed
    the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But 'tis no matter;[4459]
    this poor show doth better: this doth infer the zeal I had
    to see him.

    _Shal._ It doth so.[4460]                                            15

    _Fal._ It shows my earnestness of affection,--[4461]

    _Shal._ It doth so.[4462]

    _Fal._ My devotion,--

    _Shal._ It doth, it doth, it doth.[4462]

    _Fal._ As it were, to ride day and night; and not to                 20
    deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience to shift
    me,--

    _Shal._ It is best, certain.[4463]

    _Fal._ But to stand stained with travel, and sweating[4464]
    with desire to see him; thinking of nothing else, putting[4464]      25
    all affairs else in oblivion, as if there were nothing else
        to[4464][4465]
    be done but to see him.[4464]

    _Pist._ 'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'[4466]
    'tis all in every part.[4467]

    _Shal._ 'Tis so, indeed.                                             30

    _Pist._ My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,[4468]
    And make thee rage.[4468]
    Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,[4468][4469]
    Is in base durance and contagious prison;[4468][4469]
    Haled thither[4468][4469][4470]                                      35
    By most mechanical and dirty hand:[4468][4469][4471]
    Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto's snake,[4468][4469]

    imp of fame!

    _Fal._ God save thee, my sweet boy![4475]

    _King._ I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;
    How ill white hairs become a fool and jester![4477]
    I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,[4478]                     50
    So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane;
    But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.[4479]
    Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
    Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
    For thee thrice wider than for other men.                            55
    Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:
    Presume not that I am the thing I was;
    For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,[4480]
    That I have turn'd away my former self;
    So will I those that kept me company.                                60
    When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
    Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
    The tutor and the feeder of my riots:
    Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,
    As I have done the rest of my misleaders,                            65
    Not to come near our person by ten mile.[4481]
    For competence of life I will allow you,
    That lack of means enforce you not to evil:[4482]
    And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,[4483]
    We will, according to your strengths and qualities,[4484]            70
    Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,[4485]

    _Shal._ Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to[4490]           75
    let me have home with me.

    _Fal._ That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not
    you grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to him:
    look you, he must seem thus to the world: fear not your
    advancements; I will be the man yet that shall make you[4491]        80
    great.

    _Shal._ I cannot well perceive how, unless you should[4492]
    give me your doublet, and stuff me out with straw. I beseech
    you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred of my
    thousand.                                                            85

    _Fal._ Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you
    heard was but a colour.

    _Shal._ A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.[4493]

    _Fal._ Fear no colours: go with me to dinner: come,[4494]
    Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent for soon[4494]    90
    at night.[4494]

   _Re-enter_ PRINCE JOHN, _the_ LORD CHIEF-JUSTICE; Officers _with
                             them_.[4495]

    _Ch. Just._ Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:
    Take all his company along with him.

    _Fal._ My lord, my lord,--

    _Ch. Just._ I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.                95
    Take them away.

    _Pist._ Si fortuna me tormenta, spero contenta.

              [_Exeunt all but Prince John and the Chief-Justice._[4496]

    _Lan._ I like this fair proceeding of the king's:
    He hath intent his wonted followers
    Shall all be very well provided for;[4497]                          100
    But all are banish'd till their conversations[4497]
    Appear more wise and modest to the world.[4498]

    _Ch. Just._ And so they are.

    _Lan._ The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.

    _Ch. Just._ He hath.                                                105

    _Lan._ I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
    We bear our civil swords and native fire
    As far as France: I heard a bird so sing,[4499]
    Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.
    Come, will you hence?                                   [_Exeunt._  110

EPILOGUE.

                      _Spoken by a_ Dancer.[4500]


    First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech. My[4501]
    fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty; and my
    speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech
    now, you undo me: for what I have to say is of mine own
    making; and what indeed I should say will, I doubt, prove[4502]       5
    mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the
    venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was
    lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your
    patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant[4503]
    indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an ill venture           10
    it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle
    creditors, lose. Here I promised you I would be and
    here I commit my body to your mercies: bate me some
    and I will pay you some and, as most debtors do, promise
    you infinitely.[4504]                                                15

    If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you
    command me to use my legs? and yet that were but light
    payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience
    will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All[4505]
    the gentlewomen here have forgiven me: if the gentlemen[4506]        20
    will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen,
    which was never seen before in such an assembly.[4507]

    One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too
    much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue
    the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry                   25
    with fair Katharine of France: where, for anything I know,
    Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already a' be killed[4508]
    with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and[4509]
    this is not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs
    are too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down[4510]          30
    before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.[4510]

NOTES.


NOTE I.

The list of Dramatis Personæ given in the first Folio differs but
slightly from that prefixed to our text. Thus Northumberland, &c. are
classed as 'Opposites against King Henrie the Fourth:' Warwick, &c.
as 'Of the king's partie,' and Pointz, &c. as 'Irregular Humorists.'
The Dancer who speaks the Epilogue is called 'Epilogue.' As Blunt is
mentioned as present (iv. 3. 73), we have inserted his name in the
list. Coleridge, with an especial reference to II. 2. 153, proposes
to change 'Doll Tearsheet,' into 'Doll Tearstreet,' and Sidney Walker
approves of the suggestion (_Criticisms_, III. 135). The Servant of the
Lord Chief-Justice, called by Capell his 'Gentleman,' is not in the
list of the Folio.


NOTE II.

INDUCTION. As usual in the Quarto there is no division into acts and
scenes. In the Folios the 'Induction' is reckoned as the first scene,
the second scene beginning with the entry of Lord Bardolph. We have
followed Pope.


NOTE III.

I. 2. 113. Theobald refers to the stage direction of the Quarto in
this place as a proof that Falstaff was originally called Oldcastle,
and that 'the play being printed from the stage-manuscript, Oldcastle
had been all along alter'd into Falstaff, except in this single place
by an oversight: of which the printers not being aware, continued
these initial traces of the original name.' Steevens suggested that
_Old._ might have been the beginning of some actor's name, but this
supposition is rejected by Malone, who maintains that 'there is no
proof whatsoever that Falstaff ever was called Oldcastle in these
plays.' 'The letters prefixed to this speech crept into the first
Quarto copy,' he adds, 'I have no doubt, merely from Oldcastle being,
behind the scenes, the familiar theatrical appellation of Falstaff, who
was his stage-successor.'


NOTE IV.

I. 3. 36-38. We have left this passage as it stands in the Folios,
agreeing with Mr Staunton that something has been lost or misprinted.
Pope read:

    'Yes, if this present quality of war
    Impede the instant act; a cause on foot
    Lives &c.'

Johnson suggested:

    'Yes, in this present quality of war,
    Indeed of instant action. A cause &c.'

Capell read:

    'Yes, if the present quality of war
    Impede the present action. A cause &c.'

Malone, partially adopting Johnson's emendation:

    'Yes, in this present quality of war;--
    Indeed the instant action, (a cause on foot)
    Lives &c.'

Monck Mason proposes:

    'Yes, if this prescient quality of war
    Induc'd the instant action &c.'

Becket:

    'Yes, in this present quality of war
    Instance the instant action &c.'

Mr Knight retains the old reading with a new punctuation:

    'Yes;--if this present quality of war,--
    (Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot,)
    Lives &c.'

Mr Collier, following the MS. corrector, in his second edition, reads:

    'Yes, in this present quality of war:
    Indeed the instant act and cause on foot
    Lives &c.'

For 'Indeed' Steevens suggested 'Impel,' and Mason and Henley
'Induc'd.' For 'instant' Tollet would read 'instanc'd.' Delius thinks
emendation unnecessary.


NOTE V.

II. 2. 101. In the quarto no distinction is made between the letter of
Falstaff and the speaker's remarks, but in the Folios the letter is
printed in italics.


NOTE VI.

II. 4. 166. As the quotation is made by Pistol, who has just spoken of
'Cannibals' (for 'Hannibals') and of 'Trojan Greeks,' we have left it
uncorrected. It would be scarcely consistent to put correct Italian,
or Spanish, into his mouth. All the editors assume that Italian is
the language meant, and give it, as such, more or less correctly. If
Pistol's sword were a Toledo blade, the motto would be Spanish. In that
case 'Si' and 'me' would need no alteration. Mr Douce mentions a sword
inscribed with a French version of the motto. On the same ground we
have left 'obsque,' for 'absque,' (v. 5. 28).


NOTE VII.

II. 4. 221 sqq. We follow the Quarto in writing _'s_ for _is, i'_ for
_in, 'll_ for _will, an_ for _if, a'_ for _he_, &c. as it seems to
represent better the language of the speakers, and from this point we
cease to record such minute discrepancies between it and the Folios.


NOTE VIII.

II. 4. 342. At this point commences an important variation between
different copies of the Quarto. In the earlier impression, which we
call Q₁, the whole of Act III. Sc. 1, was omitted, but inserted in
the latter (Q₂), and in order to make room for this insertion two new
leaves were added to sheet E, but as the new matter did not exactly
fill up the two leaves required, the pagination was altered. Hence
in Q₂, Sig. E 3 recto is made to terminate at 'how now, what's the
matter?' (II. 4. 342) which is seven lines from the bottom in Q₁. The
two become again identical at 'strong and of good friends' (III. 2.
99), the first line of Sig. F.


NOTE IX.

III. 2. 126. We retain the reading of the Quarto, understanding 'much'
in the ironical sense in which it is often found. See _As You Like
It_, IV. 3. 2, and the present play, II. 4. 121.


NOTE X.

III. 2. 293 and 310. Here there are variations in different copies of
the Quarto, in line 293, between _genius_ and _gemies_, and, in line
310, between _Let_ and _Till_. A variation is found also, V. 2. 140,
between _you_ and _your_.


NOTE XI.

IV. I. 93, 95. These lines are omitted in the Folios and in some copies
of the Quarto. With regard to the former line, Theobald says that his
copy of the Quarto read, 'And consecrate Commotion's _civil_ Edge:' in
his text he altered 'civil edge' to 'civil page.'

IV. I. 94. Mr Singer supposed that after _commonwealth_ a line had been
lost, something to the following effect:

    'Whose wrongs do loudly call out for redress.'

Mr Julius Lloyd writes to us: "I am sure the lines are transposed and
should be read thus:

    'I make my quarrel in particular
    My brother; general, the commonwealth.'

"The transposition is proved, further, by the separation of the
doubtful lines:

    'And consecrate commotion's bitter edge
    To brother born an household cruelty,'

which are plainly continuous."

Mr Spedding writes: "I think some lines have been lost. If

    'And consecrate commotion's bitter edge'

belongs to Westmoreland's speech, there must have been another line
following, to complete the cadence both in sound and sense. And again,
if

    'There is no need of any such redress'

is the beginning of his next speech, it is equally clear that something
about 'redress' must have been said between. The opposition between
'brother general' and 'brother born' reads to me like Shakespeare, and
not likely to have come in by accident: and though the transposition of
the lines [as suggested by Mr Lloyd] is ingenious and intelligible and
in another context might be natural, it does not come naturally in the
context proposed. Conjecture seems hopeless in such a case."

On the whole, we are of opinion that several lines have been omitted,
and those which remain displaced, and that this is one of the many
passages in which the true text is irrecoverable.


NOTE XII.

IV. 2. 27. The reading 'seal,' which has been attributed to Mr
Collier's MS. corrector, we have assigned to Capell, considering that
we are justified in doing so, because in his _Various Readings_ (part
I. p. 52) he has the note 'Seal 1ˢᵗ F.--.' We think it clear that
he inadvertently attributed a conjecture of his own to the first and
following Folios. The manner in which the entry is made in his MS.,
which we have consulted, confirms this view.


NOTE XIII.

IV. 4, and IV. 5. The Jerusalem Chamber in which the king died
belonged, as Holinshed tells us (p. 1162, col. 2, ed. 1577), to the
Abbot of Westminster. The same authority states that he was first taken
ill not in the Jerusalem Chamber, as Shakespeare says (IV. 5. 233,
234), but when paying his devotions at the shrine of S. Edward.

Although neither the Folios nor any more recent editors make a change
of scene after line 132, we have ventured to do so, for, as Mr Dyce
says, 'In fact the audience of Shakespeare's time were to suppose that
a change of scene took place as soon as the king was laid on the bed.'
(On the same principle, all editors except Rowe have made a new scene
to begin after IV. I. 228, where no change is marked in the Folios.)

Capell's stage direction is not satisfactory, for it implies a change
of scene, though none is indicated in the text. The king's couch would
not be placed in a recess at the back of the stage, because he has to
make speeches from it of considerable length. He must therefore be
lying in front of the stage where he could be seen and heard by the
audience.


NOTE XIV.

IV. 5. 60, &c. We give Pope's arrangement of this passage in full:

    '_K. Henry._ The Prince hath ta'en it hence; go seek him out.
    Is he so hasty, that he doth suppose
    My sleep my death? find him, my lord of _Warwick_,
    And chide him hither strait; this part of his
    Conjoins with my disease, and helps to end me.
    See, sons, what things you are! how quickly nature
    Falls to revolt, when gold becomes her object?
    For this, the foolish over-careful fathers
    Have broke their sleeps with thought, their brains with care,
    Their bones with industry: for this engrossed
    The canker'd heaps of strange-atchieved gold:
    For this, they have been thoughtful to invest
    Their sons with arts and martial exercises:
    When, like the Bee, culling from ev'ry Flow'r,
    Our thighs are packt with wax, our mouths with honey &c.'


NOTE XV.

V. 3. 36. This, like all Silence's snatches of song, is printed as
prose in the Quarto, and ends _shrovetide, be mery, be mery_. The
Folios print these words in te same line, but with a full stop at
_Shrovetide_. Rowe, and all subsequent editors to Johnson inclusive,
printed the last four words as if they were spoken, not sung. Capell
corrected the error, and printed, _Be merry, be merry, &c._ In line
75, the word _Samingo_ is printed as if spoken, and not sung, by all
editors down to Malone.


NOTE XVI.

V. 4. 1. 'Sincklo.' See note IV. to _The Taming of the Shrew_.


NOTE XVII.

V. 5. 1. The Quarto prefixes the numbers 1, 2, 3, to the first three
speeches of this scene. Mr Dyce conjectures that the speech given to
the first groom at line 3, might be distributed thus:

    '_Third Groom._ It will be two of the clock ere they come from the
    coronation.

    _First Groom._ Dispatch, dispatch.'


NOTE XVIII.

V. 5. 4. It seems probable from the stage-direction of the Quarto, that
the king first crossed the stage in procession to his coronation, which
is supposed to take place during the dialogue between Falstaff and the
others, and that on his second entrance he appeared with the crown on
his head.

SCENE I. _London. An ante-chamber in the_ KING'S _palace_.

  _Enter the_ ARCHBISHOP of CANTERBURY, _and the_ BISHOP of ELY.[4519]

    _Cant._ My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
    Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
    Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
    But that the scambling and unquiet time
    Did push it out of farther question.[4520]                            5

    _Ely._ But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?

    _Cant._ It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
    We lose the better half of our possession:[4521]
    For all the temporal lands which men devout
    By testament have given to the church                                10
    Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
    As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
    Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
    Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
    And, to relief of lazars and weak age,                               15
    Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
    A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
    And to the coffers of the king beside,
    A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.[4522]

    _Ely._ This would drink deep.

    _Cant._                       'Twould drink the cup and all.         20

    _Ely._ But what prevention?

    _Cant._ The king is full of grace and fair regard.

    _Ely._ And a true lover of the holy church.[4523]

    _Cant._ The courses of his youth promised it not.[4524]
    The breath no sooner left his father's body,                         25
    But that his wildness, mortified in him,
    Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
    Consideration, like an angel, came
    And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
    Leaving his body as a paradise,                                      30
    To envelope and contain celestial spirits.
    Never was such a sudden scholar made;
    Never came reformation in a flood,
    With such a heady currance, scouring faults;[4525]
    Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness[4526]                              35
    So soon did lose his seat and all at once[4527]
    As in this king.

    _Ely._           We are blessed in the change.[4528]

    _Cant._ Hear him but reason in divinity,
    And all-admiring with an inward wish
    You would desire the king were made a prelate:                       40
    Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
    You would say it hath been all in all his study:[4529]
    List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
    A fearful battle render'd you in music:
    Turn him to any cause of policy,[4530]                               45
    The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
    Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,[4531]
    The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
    And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
    To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;                            50
    So that the art and practic part of life[4532]
    Must be the mistress to this theoric:[4533]
    Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
    Since his addiction was to courses vain,
    His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,                          55
    His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
    And never noted in him any study,
    Any retirement, any sequestration
    From open haunts and popularity.

    _Ely._ The strawberry grows underneath the nettle                    60
    And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
    Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
    And so the prince obscured his contemplation
    Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
    Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,                        65
    Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.[4534]

    _Cant._ It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
    And therefore we must needs admit the means
    How things are perfected.

    _Ely._                    But, my good lord,
    How now for mitigation of this bill                                  70
    Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
    Incline to it, or no?

    _Cant._               He seems indifferent,
    Or rather swaying more upon our part
    Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
    For I have made an offer to his majesty,                             75
    Upon our spiritual convocation[4535]
    And in regard of causes now in hand,
    Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
    As touching France, to give a greater sum
    Than ever at one time the clergy yet                                 80
    Did to his predecessors part withal.

    _Ely._ How did this offer seem received, my lord?

    _Cant._ With good acceptance of his majesty;
    Save that there was not time enough to hear,
    As I perceived his grace would fain have done,                       85
    The severals and unhidden passages[4536]
    Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
    And generally to the crown and seat of France[4537]
    Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

    _Ely._ What was the impediment that broke this off?                  90

    _Cant._ The French ambassador upon that instant
    Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
    To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?

    _Ely._ It is.

    _Cant._ Then go we in, to know his embassy;                          95
    Which I could with a ready guess declare,
    Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.[4538]

    _Ely._ I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.         [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _The same. The Presence chamber._

       _Enter_ KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK,
                 WESTMORELAND, _and_ Attendants.[4539]

    _K. Hen._ Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?

    _Exe._ Not here in presence.

    _K. Hen._                    Send for him, good uncle.

    _West._ Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?

    _K. Hen._ Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
    Before we hear him, of some things of weight                          5
    That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.

  _Enter the_ ARCHBISHOP of CANTERBURY _and the_ BISHOP of ELY.[4540]

    _Cant._ God and his angels guard your sacred throne,[4541]
    And make you long become it!

    _K. Hen._                    Sure, we thank you.
    My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
    And justly and religiously unfold                                    10
    Why the law Salique that they have in France[4542]
    Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
    And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
    That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
    Or nicely charge your understanding soul                             15
    With opening titles miscreate, whose right
    Suits not in native colours with the truth;
    For God doth know how many now in health
    Shall drop their blood in approbation
    Of what your reverence shall incite us to.                           20
    Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,[4543]
    How you awake our sleeping sword of war:[4544]
    We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
    For never two such kingdoms did contend
    Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops[4545]              25
    Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
    'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords[4546][4547]
    That make such waste in brief mortality.[4547]
    Under this conjuration speak, my lord;[4548]
    For we will hear, note and believe in heart[4549]                    30
    That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
    As pure as sin with baptism.[4550]

    _Cant._ Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
    That owe yourselves, your lives and services[4551]
    To this imperial throne. There is no bar                             35
    To make against your highness' claim to France
    But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
    'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'[4552]
    'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
    Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze                         40
    To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
    The founder of this law and female bar.
    Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
    That the land Salique is in Germany,[4553]
    Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;[4554]                        45
    Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
    There left behind and settled certain French;
    Who, holding in disdain the German women
    For some dishonest manners of their life,[4555]
    Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female[4556]                   50
    Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
    Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,[4554]
    Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
    Then doth it well appear the Salique law[4557]
    Was not devised for the realm of France;                             55
    Nor did the French possess the Salique land
    Until four hundred one and twenty years
    After defunction of King Pharamond,
    Idly supposed the founder of this law;
    Who died within the year of our redemption                           60
    Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
    Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
    Beyond the river Sala, in the year
    Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
    King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,                                 65
    Did, as heir general, being descended
    Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,[4558]
    Make claim and title to the crown of France.
    Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown[4559]
    Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male                      70
    Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
    To find his title with some shows of truth,[4560]
    Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,[4561]
    Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,[4562]
    Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son                              75
    To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son[4563]
    Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the tenth,[4564]
    Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
    Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
    Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied                          80
    That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
    Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
    Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:[4565]
    By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great[4566]
    Was re-united to the crown of France.                                85
    So that, as clear as is the summer's sun,
    King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
    King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear[4567]
    To hold in right and title of the female:
    So do the kings of France unto this day;[4568]                       90
    Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
    To bar your highness claiming from the female,
    And rather choose to hide them in a net
    Than amply to imbar their crooked titles[4569]
    Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.                               95

    _K. Hen._ May I with right and conscience make this claim?

    _Cant._ The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
    For in the book of Numbers is it writ,[4570]
    When the man dies, let the inheritance[4571]
    Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,                           100
    Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
    Look back into your mighty ancestors:[4572]
    Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,[4573]
    From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
    And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,[4574]              105
    Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
    Making defeat on the full power of France,
    Whiles his most mighty father on a hill[4575]
    Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
    Forage in blood of French nobility.[4576]                           110
    O noble English, that could entertain
    With half their forces the full pride of France[4577]
    And let another half stand laughing by,
    All out of work and cold for action![4578]

    _Ely._ Awake remembrance of these valiant dead                      115
    And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
    You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
    The blood and courage that renowned them
    Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
    Is in the very May-morn of his youth,                               120
    Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

    _Exc._ Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
    Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
    As did the former lions of your blood.

    _West._ They know your grace hath cause and means and
        might;[4579][4580]                                              125
    So hath your highness; never king of England[4580]
    Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
    Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
    And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.[4581]

    _Cant._ O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,[4582]            130
    With blood and sword and fire to win your right;[4582][4583]
    In aid whereof we of the spiritualty[4584]
    Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
    As never did the clergy at one time
    Bring in to any of your ancestors.                                  135

    _K. Hen._ We must not only arm to invade the French,
    But lay down our proportions to defend[4585]
    Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
    With all advantages.

    _Cant._ They of those marches, gracious sovereign,[4586]            140
    Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
    Our inland from the pilfering borderers.

    _K. Hen._ We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,[4587]
    But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
    Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;[4588]                  145
    For you shall read that my great-grandfather
    Never went with his forces into France[4589]
    But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
    Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
    With ample and brim fulness of his force,                           150
    Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,[4590]
    Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
    That England, being empty of defence,
    Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.[4591]

    _Cant._ She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;       155
    For hear her but exampled by herself:[4592]
    When all her chivalry hath been in France
    And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
    She hath herself not only well defended
    But taken and impounded as a stray                                  160
    The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
    To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings[4593]
    And make her chronicle as rich with praise[4594]
    As is the ooze and bottom of the sea[4595]
    With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries.                           165

    _West._ But there's a saying very old and true,[4596]
                'If that you will France win,[4597]
                Then with Scotland first begin:'[4597]
    For once the eagle England being in prey,
    To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot                               170
    Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
    Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
    To tear and havoc more than she can eat.[4598]

    _Exe._ It follows then the cat must stay at home:[4599]
    Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,[4600]                          175
    Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
    And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.[4601]
    While that the armed hand cloth fight abroad,
    The advised head defends itself at home;
    For government, though high and low and lower,[4602]                180
    Put into parts, cloth keep in one consent,[4603]
    Congreeing in a full and natural close,[4604]
    Like music.

    _Cant._      Therefore doth heaven divide[4605]
    The state of man in divers functions,
    Setting endeavour in continual motion;                              185
    To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
    Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
    Creatures that by a rule in nature teach[4606]
    The act of order to a peopled kingdom.[4607]
    They have a king and officers of sorts;[4608]                       190
    Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
    Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,[4609]
    Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
    Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,[4610]
    Which pillage they with merry march bring home                      195
    To the tent-royal of their emperor;
    Who, busied in his majesty, surveys[4611]
    The singing masons building roofs of gold,[4612]
    The civil citizens kneading up the honey,[4613]
    The poor mechanic porters crowding in                               200
    Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
    The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
    Delivering o'er to executors pale
    The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
    That many things, having full reference                             205
    To one consent, may work contrariously:
    As many arrows, loosed several ways,
    Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;[4614]
    As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;[4615]
    As many lines close in the dial's centre;                           210
    So may a thousand actions, once afoot,[4616]
    End in one purpose, and be all well borne[4617]
    Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.[4618]
    Divide your happy England into four;
    Whereof take you one quarter into France,                           215
    And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
    If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
    Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
    Let us be worried and our nation lose
    The name of hardiness and policy.                                   220

    _K. Hen._ Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.[4619]

                                              [_Exeunt some Attendants._

    Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
    And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
    France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
    Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,[4620]                225
    Ruling in large and ample empery
    O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
    Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
    Tombless, with no remembrance over them:
    Either our history shall with full mouth[4621]                      230
    Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
    Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,[4622]
    Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.

                 _Enter_ Ambassadors _of France_.[4623]

    Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure[4624]
    Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear                             235
    Your greeting is from him, not from the king.

    _First Amb._ May't please your majesty to give us leave[4625]
    Freely to render what we have in charge;
    Or shall we sparingly show you far off
    The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?                              240

    _K. Hen._ We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
    Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
    As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:[4626]
    Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
    Tell us the Dauphin's mind.

    _First Amb._                Thus, then, in few.[4627]               245
    Your highness, lately sending into France,
    Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
    Of your great predecessor, King Edward the third.[4628]
    In answer of which claim, the prince our master
    Says that you savour too much of your youth,                        250
    And bids you be advised there's nought in France[4629]
    That can be with a nimble galliard won;
    You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
    He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
    This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,                         255
    Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
    Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.[4630]

    _K. Hen._ What treasure, uncle?

    _Exe._                          Tennis-balls, my liege.

    _K. Hen._ We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
    His present and your pains we thank you for:                        260
    When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
    We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
    Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
    Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler[4631]
    That all the courts of France will be disturb'd                     265
    With chaces. And we understand him well,
    How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
    Not measuring what use we made of them.
    We never valued this poor seat of England;
    And therefore, living hence, did give ourself[4632]                 270
    To barbarous license; as 'tis ever common
    That men are merriest when they are from home.
    But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
    Be like a king and show my sail of greatness[4633]
    When I do rouse me in my throne of France:                          275
    For that I have laid by my majesty[4634]
    And plodded like a man for working-days,
    But I will rise there with so full a glory
    That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
    Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.                        280
    And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
    Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
    Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
    That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows[4635]
    Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;                285
    Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
    And some are yet ungotten and unborn[4636]
    That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
    But this lies all within the will of God,
    To whom I do appeal; and in whose name                              290
    Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on.
    To venge me as I may and to put forth
    My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
    So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
    His jest will savour but of shallow wit,                            295
    When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.[4637]
    Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.[4638]

                                                  [_Exeunt Ambassadors._

    _Exe._ This was a merry message.

    _K. Hen._ We hope to make the sender blush at it.[4639]
    Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour                             300
    That may give furtherance to our expedition;
    For we have now no thought in us but France,[4640]
    Save those to God, that run before our business.
    Therefore let our proportions for these wars
    Be soon collected and all things thought upon[4641]                 305
    That may with reasonable swiftness add[4642]
    More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
    We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
    Therefore let every man now task his thought,
    That this fair action may on foot be brought.[4643]                 310

PROLOGUE.[4644]

                            _Enter_ Chorus.

    _Chor._ Now all the youth of England are on fire,[4645]
    And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
    Now thrive the armorers, and honour's thought[4646]
    Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
    They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,                           5
    Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
    With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
    For now sits Expectation in the air,
    And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
    With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,                           10
    Promised to Harry and his followers.
    The French, advised by good intelligence
    Of this most dreadful preparation,
    Shake in their fear and with pale policy
    Seek to divert the English purposes.                                 15
    O England! model to thy inward greatness,
    Like little body with a mighty heart,
    What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
    Were all thy children kind and natural!
    But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out[4647]               20
    A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills[4647][4648]
    With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
    One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
    Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
    Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,                          25
    Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!--
    Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
    And by their hands this grace of kings must die,[4649]
    If hell and treason hold their promises,[4649]
    Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.[4649][4650]         30
    Linger your patience on; and we'll digest[4649][4651][4652]
    The abuse of distance; force a play:[4649][4651][4653]
    The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;[4649][4654]
    The king is set from London; and the scene[4649]
    Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;[4649]                   35
    There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
    And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
    And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
    To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
    We'll not offend one stomach with our play.                          40
    But, till the king come forth, and not till then,[4655]
    Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.                     [_Exit._


SCENE I. _London. A street._[4656]

            _Enter_ Corporal NYM _and_ Lieutenant BARDOLPH.

    _Bard._ Well met, Corporal Nym.

    _Nym._ Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.

    _Bard._ What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?

    _Nym._ For my part, I care not: I say little; but when
    time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as[4657]   5
    it may. I dare not fight; but I will wink and hold out
    mine iron: it is a simple one; but what though? it will
    toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man's
    sword will: and there's an end.[4658]

    _Bard._ I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends;               10
    and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it be[4659]
    so, good Corporal Nym.

    _Nym._ Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the
    certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I will
    do as I may: that is my rest, that is the rendezvous[4660]           15
    of it.

    _Bard._ It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell
    Quickly: and, certainly, she did you wrong; for you were
    troth-plight to her.

    _Nym._ I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men                20
    may sleep, and they may have their throats about them at[4661]
    that time; and some say knives have edges. It must be
    as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet she will[4662]
    plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I cannot tell.

                  _Enter_ PISTOL _and_ HOSTESS.[4663]

    _Bard._ Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good                 25
    corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!

    _Pist._ Base tike, call'st thou me host?[4664][4665]
    Now, by this hand, I swear, I scorn the term;[4665]
    Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.[4665]

    _Host._ No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge               30
    and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live
    honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will be thought
    we keep a bawdy house straight. [_Nym and Pistol draw._][4666]
    O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we shall see[4667]
    wilful adultery and murder committed.                                35

    _Bard._ Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing[4668]
    here.

    _Nym._ Pish![4669]

    _Pist._ Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of
        Iceland![4670]

    _Host._ Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put[4671]            40
    up your sword.

    _Nym._ Will you shog off? I would have you solus.[4672]

    _Pist._ 'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile![4673]
    The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;[4673][4674]
    The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,[4673]                   45
    And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,[4673]
    And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth![4673][4675]
    1 do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;[4673]
    For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,[4673][4676]
    And flashing fire will follow.[4673]                                 50

    _Nym._ I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I
    have an humour to knock you indifferently well. If you
    grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my rapier,
    as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk off, I would
    prick your guts a little, in good terms, as I may: and               55
    that's the humour of it.

    _Pist._ O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
    The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;[4677]
    Therefore exhale.[4678]

    _Bard._ Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the             60
    first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.

                                                         [_Draws._[4679]

    _Pist._ An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.
    Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:[4680]
    Thy spirits are most tall.[4680][4681]

    _Nym._ I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair             65
    terms: that is the humour of it.

    _Pist._ 'Couple a gorge!'[4682]
    That is the word. I thee defy again.[4683][4684]
    O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?[4683]
    No; to the spital go,[4683]                                          70
    And from the powdering-tub of infamy[4683]
    Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,[4683]
    Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:[4683]
    I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly[4683]
    For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough.[4683]
    Go to.[4683]                                                         75

                      _Enter the_ Boy.[4683][4685]

    _Boy._ Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master,[4686]
    and you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.
    Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and do[4687]
    the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.                   80

    _Bard._ Away, you rogue!

    _Host._ By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one
    of these days. The king has killed his heart. Good husband,
    come home presently.                [_Exeunt Hostess and Boy._[4688]

    _Bard._ Come, shall I make you two friends? We must                  85
    to France together: why the devil should we keep knives
    to cut one another's throats?

    _Pist._ Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!

    _Nym._ You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you
    at betting?                                                          90

    _Pist._ Base is the slave that pays.

    _Nym._ That now I will have: that's the humour of it.

    _Pist._ As manhood shall compound: push home.

                                                     [_They draw._[4689]

    _Bard._ By this sword, he that makes the first thrust,
    I'll kill him; by this sword, I will.                                95

    _Pist._ Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.[4690]

    _Bard._ Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be[4690]
    friends: an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me
    too. Prithee, put up.

    _Nym._ I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at[4691]        100
    betting?[4691][4692]

    _Pist._ A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;[4692]
    And liquor likewise will I give to thee,[4692]
    And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:[4692][4693]
    I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;[4692]                   105
    Is not this just? for I shall sutler be[4692]
    Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.[4692]
    Give me thy hand.[4692]

    _Nym._ I shall have my noble?

    _Pist._ In cash most justly paid.                                   110

    _Nym._ Well, then, that's the humour of't.

                       _Re-enter_ HOSTESS.[4694]

    _Host._ As ever you came of women, come in quickly to[4695]
    Sir John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning[4696]
    quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold.
    Sweet men, come to him.                                             115

    _Nym._ The king hath run bad humours on the knight;
    that's the even of it.

    _Pist._ Nym, thou hast spoke the right;[4697]
    His heart is fracted and corroborate.[4697]

    _Nym._ The king is a good king: but it must be as it                120
    may; he passes some humours and careers.

    _Pist._ Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will[4698]
    live.


SCENE II. _Southampton. A council-chamber._[4699]

              _Enter_ EXETER, BEDFORD, _and_ WESTMORELAND.

    _Bed._ 'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.

    _Exe._ They shall be apprehended by and by.

    _West._ How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
    As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
    Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.                              5

    _Bed._ The king hath note of all that they intend,
    By interception which they dream not of.

    _Exe._ Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,[4700]
    Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,[4700][4701]
    That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell[4700]                   10
    His sovereign's life to death and treachery.[4700]

      _Trumpets sound. Enter_ KING HENRY, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY,
                        _and_ Attendants.[4702]

    _K. Hen._ Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
    My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,[4703]
    And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:
    Think you not that the powers we bear with us                        15
    Will cut their passage through the force of France,
    Doing the execution and the act
    For which we have in head assembled them?[4704]

    _Scroop._ No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.

    _K. Hen._ I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded              20
    We carry not a heart with us from hence
    That grows not in a fair consent with ours,[4705]
    Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish[4706]
    Success and conquest to attend on us.

    _Cam._ Never was monarch better fear'd and loved[4707]               25
    Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject[4708]
    That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
    Under the sweet shade of your government.

    _Grey._ True: those that were your father's enemies[4709]
    Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you[4710]             30
    With hearts create of duty and of zeal.

    _K. Hen._ We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
    And shall forget the office of our hand,
    Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
    According to the weight and worthiness.[4711]                        35

    _Scroop._ So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
    And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
    To do your grace incessant services.

    _K. Hen._ We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
    Enlarge the man committed yesterday,                                 40
    That rail'd against our person: we consider
    It was excess of wine that set him on;
    And on his more advice we pardon him.[4712]

    _Scroop._ That's mercy, but too much security:
    Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example                         45
    Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

    _K. Hen._ O, let us yet be merciful.[4713]

    _Cam._ So may your highness, and yet punish too.

    _Grey._ Sir,[4714]
    You show great mercy, if you give him life,[4714]                    50
    After the taste of much correction.

    _K. Hen._ Alas, your too much love and care of me
    Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
    If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
    Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye                 55
    When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,
    Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,[4715]
    Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care
    And tender preservation of our person,
    Would have him punish'd. And now to our French causes:[4716]         60
    Who are the late commissioners?[4717]

    _Cam._ I one, my lord:
    Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.

    _Scroop._ So did you me, my liege.

    _Grey._ And I, my royal sovereign.[4718]                             65

    _K. Hen._ Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
    There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,[4719]
    Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
    Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.
    My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,                           70
    We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!
    What see you in those papers that you lose
    So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
    Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there,
    That hath so cowarded and chased your blood[4720]                    75
    Out of appearance?

    _Cam._             I do confess my fault;[4721]
    And do submit me to your highness' mercy.

    _Grey._    }  To which we all appeal.
    _Scroop._  }

    _K. Hen._ The mercy that was quick in us but late,
    By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:                        80
    You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
    For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,[4722]
    As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.[4723]
    See you, my princes and my noble peers,
    These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,[4724]             85
    You know how apt our love was to accord
    To furnish him with all appertinents[4725]
    Belonging to his honour; and this man
    Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
    And sworn unto the practices of France,                              90
    To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
    This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
    Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
    What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
    Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!                             95
    Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
    That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
    That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,
    Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,
    May it be possible, that foreign hire                               100
    Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
    That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
    That, though the truth of it stands off as gross[4726]
    As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.[4727]
    Treason and murder ever kept together,                              105
    As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
    Working so grossly in a natural cause,[4728]
    That admiration did not whoop at them:[4729]
    But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
    Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:[4730]                      110
    And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
    That wrought upon thee so preposterously[4731]
    Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:[4732]
    All other devils that suggest by treasons[4733]
    Do botch and bungle up damnation                                    115
    With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd[4734]
    From glistering semblances of piety;
    But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,[4735]
    Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
    Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.                        120
    If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
    Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,[4736]
    He might return to vasty Tartar back,
    And tell the legions 'I can never win
    A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'                               125
    O, how hast thou with jealousy infected
    The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
    Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?[4737]
    Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
    Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?                            130
    Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
    Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
    Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,[4738]
    Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,[4739]
    Not working with the eye without the ear,[4740]                     135
    And but in purged judgement trusting neither?
    Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
    And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
    To mark the full-fraught man and best indued[4741]
    With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;[4741][4742]              140
    For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
    Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
    Arrest them to the answer of the law;
    And God acquit them of their practices!

    _Exe._ I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of                145
    Richard Earl of Cambridge.

    I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Henry[4743]
    Lord Scroop of Masham.

    I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas
    Grey, knight, of Northumberland.[4744]                              150

    _Scroop._ Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;
    And I repent my fault more than my death;
    Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
    Although my body pay the price of it.

    _Cam._ For me, the gold of France did not seduce;[4745]             155
    Although I did admit it as a motive
    The sooner to effect what I intended:
    But God be thanked for prevention;
    Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,[4746]
    Beseeching God and you to pardon me.                                160

    _Grey._ Never did faithful subject more rejoice
    At the discovery of most dangerous treason
    Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself,
    Prevented from a damned enterprise:
    My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.                       165

    _K. Hen._ God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
    You have conspired against our royal person,
    Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers[4747]
    Received the golden earnest of our death;
    Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,                 170
    His princes and his peers to servitude,
    His subjects to oppression and contempt
    And his whole kingdom into desolation.[4748]
    Touching our person seek we no revenge;
    But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,                         175
    Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws[4749]
    We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,[4750]
    Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
    The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
    You patience to endure, and true repentance                         180
    Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.

                   [_Exeunt Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, guarded._[4751]

    Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
    Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
    We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,[4752]
    Since God so graciously hath brought to light                       185
    This dangerous treason lurking in our way[4753]
    To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now[4754]
    But every rub is smoothed on our way.[4755]
    Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
    Our puissance into the hand of God,                                 190
    Putting it straight in expedition.
    Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:[4756]
    No king of England, if not king of France,                [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _London. Before a Tavern._[4757]

           _Enter_ PISTOL, HOSTESS, NYM, BARDOLPH, _and_ Boy.

    _Host._ Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee[4758]
    to Staines.

    _Pist._ No; for my manly heart doth yearn.[4759][4760]
    Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:[4759]
    Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is
        dead,[4759][4761][4762]                                           5
    And we must yearn therefore.[4759][4760][4762]

    _Bard._ Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is,
    either in heaven or in hell![4763]

    _Host._ Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's bosom,[4764]
    if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made a[4765]                  10
    finer end and went away an it had been any christom[4765][4766]
    child; a' parted even just between twelve and one, even at[4767][4768]
    the turning o' the tide: for after I saw him fumble with[4768][4769]
    the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his[4770]
    fingers' ends, I knew there was but one way; for his nose[4771]      15
    was as sharp as a pen, and a' babbled of green fields.[4772]
    'How now, Sir John!' quoth I: 'what, man! be o' good[4773]
    cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or four
    times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a' should not
    think of God; I hoped there was no need to trouble himself           20
    with any such thoughts yet. So a' bade me lay more
    clothes on his feet: I put my hand into the bed and felt
    them, and they were as cold as any stone; then I felt to[4774]
    his knees, and they were as cold as any stone, and so[4775]
    upward and upward, and all was as cold as any stone.[4776]           25

    _Nym._ They say he cried out of sack.[4777]

    _Host._ Ay, that a' did.

    _Bard._ And of women.[4778]

    _Host._ Nay, that a' did not.

    _Boy._ Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils[4779]             30
    incarnate.

    _Host._ A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour[4780]
    he never liked.

    _Boy._ A' said once, the devil would have him about[4781]
    women.                                                               35

    _Host._ A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but
    then he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.

    _Boy._ Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon
    Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul burning in
    hell-fire?[4782]                                                     40

    _Bard._ Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:
    that's all the riches I got in his service.

    _Nym._ Shall we shog? the king will be gone from
    Southampton.

    _Pist._ Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.[4783]           45
    Look to my chattels and my movables:[4783]
    Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'[4783][4784]
    Trust none;[4783]
    For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,[4783]
    And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:[4783]                        50
    Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.[4783][4785]
    Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,[4783][4786]
    Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,[4783]
    To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck![4783]

    _Boy._ And that's but unwholesome food, they say.[4787]              55

    _Pist._ Touch her soft mouth, and march.

    _Bard._ Farewell, hostess.                     [_Kissing her._[4788]

    _Nym._ I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.

    _Pist._ Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.

    _Host._ Farewell; adieu.                                 [_Exeunt._  60

       BERRI _and_ BRETAGNE, _the_ CONSTABLE, _and others_.[4789]

    _Fr. King._ Thus comes the English with full power upon us;[4790]
    And more than carefully it us concerns[4791]
    To answer royally in our defences.
    Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,
    Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,[4792]                    5
    And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
    To line and new repair our towns of war
    With men of courage and with means defendant;
    For England his approaches makes as fierce
    As waters to the sucking of a gulf.                                  10
    It fits us then to be as provident
    As fear may teach us out of late examples
    Left by the fatal and neglected English[4793]
    Upon our fields.

    _Dau._           My most redoubted father,
    It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;                           15
    For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
    Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
    But that defences, musters, preparations,
    Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,
    As were a war in expectation.                                        20
    Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
    To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
    And let us do it with no show of fear;[4794]
    No, with no more than if we heard that England
    Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:                             25
    For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
    Her sceptre so fantastically borne
    By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,[4795]
    That fear attends her not.

    _Con._                     O peace, Prince Dauphin!
    You are too much mistaken in this king:                              30
    Question your grace the late ambassadors,
    With what great state he heard their embassy,
    How well supplied with noble counsellors,
    How modest in exception, and withal
    How terrible in constant resolution,                                 35
    And you shall find his vanities forespent
    Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
    Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
    As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
    That shall first spring and be most delicate.                        40

    _Dau._ Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
    But though we think it so, it is no matter:[4796]
    In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh[4797]
    The enemy more mighty than he seems:
    So the proportions of defence are fill'd;                            45
    Which of a weak and niggardly projection[4798]
    Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
    A little cloth.

    _Fr. King._ Think we King Harry strong;
    And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
    The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;                        50
    And he is bred out of that bloody strain
    That haunted us in our familiar paths:[4799]
    Witness our too much memorable shame
    When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
    And all our princes captived by the hand                             55
    Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
    Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,[4800]
    Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,[4801]
    Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,[4802]
    Mangle the work of nature and deface                                 60
    The patterns that by God and by French fathers
    Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
    Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
    The native mightiness and fate of him.[4803]

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Mess._ Ambassadors from Harry King of England[4804]                 65
    Do crave admittance to your majesty.

    _Fr. King._ We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.

                            _[Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords._[4805]

    You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.

    _Dau._ Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
    Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten              70
    Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,[4806]
    Take up the English short, and let them know[4807]
    Of what a monarchy you are the head:
    Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
    As self-neglecting.

              _Re-enter_ Lords, _with_ EXETER _and train_.

    _Fr. King._ From our brother England?[4808]                          75

    _Exe._ From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
    He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
    That you divest yourself, and lay apart
    The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,
    By law of nature and of nations, 'long[4809]                         80
    To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
    And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
    By custom and the ordinance of times
    Unto the crown of France. That you may know
    'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,                               85
    Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
    Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
    He sends you this most memorable line,[4810]
    In every branch truly demonstrative;[4811]
    Willing you overlook this pedigree:[4812]                            90
    And when you find him evenly derived
    From his most famed of famous ancestors,
    Edward the third, he bids you then resign
    Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
    From him the native and true challenger.                             95

    _Fr. King._ Or else what follows?

    _Exe._ Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
    Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
    Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,[4813]
    In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,                          100
    That, if requiring fail, he will compel;[4814]
    And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,[4815]
    Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
    On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
    Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head[4816]                        105
    Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries,[4817][4818]
    The dead men's blood, the pining maidens' groans,[4818][4819]
    For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,
    That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
    This is his claim, his threatening and my message;                  110
    Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
    To whom expressly I bring greeting too.[4820]

    _Fr. King._ For us, we will consider of this further:
    To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
    Back to our brother England.[4821]

    _Dau._                       For the Dauphin,                       115
    I stand here for him: what to him from England?

    _Exe._ Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
    And any thing that may not misbecome
    The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
    Thus says my king; an if your father's highness[4822]               120
    Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
    Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
    He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,[4823]
    That caves and womby vaultages of France
    Shall chide your trespass and return your mock[4824]                125
    In second accent of his ordnance.[4825]

    _Dau._ Say, if my father render fair return,[4826]
    It is against my will; for I desire
    Nothing but odds with England: to that end,[4827]
    As matching to his youth and vanity,[4827]                          130
    I did present him with the Paris balls.[4828]

    _Exe._ He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,[4829]
    Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
    And, be assured, you'll find a difference,
    As we his subjects have in wonder found,                            135
    Between the promise of his greener days
    And these he masters now: now he weighs time[4830]
    Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read[4831]
    In your own losses, if he stay in France.[4832]

    _Fr. King._ To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.[4833]        140

    _Exe._ Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
    Come here himself to question our delay;
    For he is footed in this land already.

    _Fr. King._ You shall be soon dispatch'd with fair conditions:
    A night is but small breath and little pause[4834]                  145
    To answer matters of this consequence.    [_Flourish. Exeunt._[4835]

PROLOGUE.

                         _Enter_ Chorus.[4836]

    _Chor._ Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
    In motion of no less celerity[4837]
    Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen[4837]
    The well-appointed king at Hampton pier[4838]
    Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet                               5
    With silken streamers the young Phœbus fanning:[4839]
    Play with your fancies, and in them behold
    Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
    Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
    To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,                       10
    Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,[4840]
    Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
    Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
    You stand upon the rivage and behold
    A city on the inconstant billows dancing;                            15
    For so appears this fleet majestical,
    Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:[4841]
    Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,[4842]
    And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
    Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,                       20
    Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;[4843]
    For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd
    With one appearing hair, that will not follow
    These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
    Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;                   25
    Behold the ordnance on their carriages,[4844]
    With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
    Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;[4845]
    Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
    Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,                      30
    Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
    The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
    With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,

                                   [_Alarum, and chambers go off._[4846]

    And down goes all before them. Still be kind,[4847]
    And eke out our performance with your mind.          [_Exit._[4848]  35


SCENE I. _France. Before Harfleur._

        _Alarum. Enter_ KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER,
             _and_ Soldiers, _with scaling-ladders_.[4849]

    _K. Hen._ Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once
        more;[4850][4851]
    Or close the wall up with our English dead.[4851]
    In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
    As modest stillness and humility:
    But when the blast of war blows in our ears,                          5
    Then imitate the action of the tiger;
    Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,[4852]
    Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
    Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
    Let it pry through the portage of the head                           10
    Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it[4853]
    As fearfully as doth a galled rock
    O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,[4854]
    Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
    Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,[4855]                15
    Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
    To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,[4856]
    Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof![4857]
    Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
    Have in these parts from morn till even fought                       20
    And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
    Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
    That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
    Be copy now to men of grosser blood,[4858]
    And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,                     25
    Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
    The mettle of your pasture; let us swear[4859]
    That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
    For there is none of you so mean and base,
    That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.                             30
    I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
    Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:[4860]
    Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
    Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'

                           [_Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go off._[4861]


SCENE II. _The same._

            _Enter_ NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, _and_ Boy.[4862]

    _Bard._ On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!

    _Nym._ Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too[4863]
    hot; and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives: the
    humour of it is too hot, that is the very plain-song of it.

    _Pist._ The plain-song is most just; for humours do                   5
    abound:[4864]

        Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;[4865]
                  And sword and shield,[4865]
                  In bloody field,[4865]
              Doth win immortal fame.[4865][4866]

    _Boy._ Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would                10
    give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.[4867]

    _Pist._ And I:[4867]

        If wishes would prevail with me,[4867][4868][4869]
        My purpose should not fail with me,[4867][4869]
            But thither would I hie.[4867][4870]                         15

    _Boy._ As duly, but not as truly,[4867][4871][4872]
        As bird doth sing on bough.[4867][4872]

                     _Enter_ FLUELLEN.[4867][4873]

    _Flu._ Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you
        cullions![4867][4874][4875]

                              [_Driving them forward._[4867][4874][4876]

    _Pist._ Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.[4867][4877]        20
    Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,[4867][4877]
    Abate thy rage, great duke![4867][4877][4878]
    Good bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet chuck![4867][4877]

    _Nym._ These be good humours! your honour wins bad[4867][4879]
    humours.                         [_Exeunt all but Boy._[4867][4880]  25

    _Boy._ As young as I am, I have observed these three
    swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they three,[4881]
    though they would serve me, could not be man to me; for
    indeed three such antics do not amount to a man. For
    Bardolph, he is white-livered and red-faced; by the means            30
    whereof a' faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath
    a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof
    a' breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he
    hath heard that men of few words are the best men; and
    therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a' should be            35
    thought a coward: but his few bad words are matched with
    as few good deeds; for a' never broke any man's head but his
    own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They
    will steal any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
    lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. 40
    Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching,
    and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel: I knew by that piece
    of service the men would carry coals. They would have me
    as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their hand-kerchers:
    which makes much against my manhood, if I[4882]                      45
    should take from another's pocket to put into mine; for it[4882][4883]
    is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them, and
    seek some better service: their villany goes against my weak
    stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.                   [_Exit._

             _Re-enter_ FLUELLEN, GOWER _following_.[4884]

    _Gow._ Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to                  50
    the mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.

    _Flu._ To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good
    to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is not according
    to the disciplines of the war: the concavities of it[4885]
    is not sufficient; for, look you, th' athversary, you may discuss    55
    unto the duke, look you, is digt himself four yard[4886]
    under the countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plow
    up all, if there is not better directions.

    _Gow._ The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of
    the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a         60
    very valiant gentleman, i' faith.

    _Flu._ It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?[4887]

    _Gow._ I think it be.

    _Flu._ By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will[4888]
    verify as much in his beard: he has no more directions in            65
    the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman
    disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.

              _Enter_ MACMORRIS _and_ Captain JAMY.[4889]

    _Gow._ Here a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain
    Jamy, with him.

    _Flu._ Captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman,[4890]        70
    that is certain; and of great expedition and knowledge in
    th' aunchient wars, upon my particular knowledge of his
    directions: by Cheshu, he will maintain his argument as
    well as any military man in the world, in the disciplines of
    the pristine wars of the Romans.                                     75

    _Jamy._ I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.[4891]

    _Flu._ God-den to your worship, good Captain James.[4892]

    _Gow._ How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit[4893]
    the mines? have the pioners given o'er?[4894]

    _Mac._ By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish give[4895]         80
    over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I swear,
    and my father's soul, the work ish ill done; it ish give
    over: I would have blowed up the town, so Chrish save
    me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done, tish ill done; by my
    hand, tish ill done!                                                 85

    _Flu._ Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you
    voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you, as partly
    touching or concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman[4896]
    wars, in the way of argument, look you, and friendly
    communication; partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly              90
    for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the
    direction of the military discipline; that is the point.

    _Jamy._ It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains
    bath: and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick
    occasion; that sall I, marry.                                        95

    _Mac._ It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the
    day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the king,
    and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The town is beseeched,[4897]
    and the trumpet call us to the breach; and we
    talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing: 'tis shame for us all: so         100
    God sa' me, 'tis shame to stand still; it is shame, by my
    hand: and there is throats to be cut, and works to be done;
    and there ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!

    _Jamy._ By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves
    to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i' the[4898]         105
    grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay 't as valorously[4898]
    as I may, that sall I suerly do, that is the breff and[4899]
    the long. Marry, I wad full fain hear some question 'tween[4900]
    you tway.

    _Flu._ Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your             110
    correction, there is not many of your nation--[4901]

    _Mac._ Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,[4902]
    and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish[4902]
    my nation? Who talks of my nation?[4902]

    _Flu._ Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than              115
    is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think
    you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you
    ought to use me, look you; being as good a man as yourself,
    both in the disciplines of war, and in the derivation of
    my birth, and in other particularities.                             120

    _Mac._ I do not know you so good a man as myself: so
    Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.

    _Gow._ Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.[4903]

    _Jamy._ A! that's a foul fault.

                                              [_A parley sounded._[4904]

    _Gow._ The town sounds a parley.                                    125

    _Flu._ Captain Macmorris, when there is more better
    opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so bold
    as to tell you I know the disciplines of war; and there is[4905]
    an end.                                                   [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _The same. Before the gates._

 _The_ Governor _and some_ Citizens _on the walls; the English forces
           below_. _Enter_ KING HENRY _and his train_.[4906]

    _K. Hen._ How yet resolves the governor of the town?
    This is the latest parle we will admit:[4907]
    Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;
    Or like to men proud of destruction
    Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,[4908]                   5
    A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
    If I begin the battery once again,
    I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
    Till in her ashes she lie buried.
    The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,                             10
    And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
    In liberty of bloody hand shall range
    With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
    Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.[4909]

    Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,[4910]
    Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
    Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
    What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
    If your pure maidens fall into the hand                              20
    Of hot and forcing violation?
    What rein can hold licentious wickedness
    When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
    We may as bootless spend our vain command
    Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil                             25
    As send precepts to the leviathan[4911][4912]
    To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,[4911]
    Take pity of your town and of your people,
    Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;[4913]
    Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace[4913]                30
    O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds[4914]
    Of heady murder, spoil and villany.[4915]
    If not, why, in a moment look to see
    The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
    Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;[4916]           35
    Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
    And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,
    Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
    Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
    Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry                       40
    At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
    What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,
    Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?[4917]

    _Gov._ Our expectation hath this day an end:
    The Dauphin, whom of succours we entreated,[4918]                    45
    Returns us that his powers are yet not ready[4919]
    To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,[4920]
    We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
    Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;
    For we no longer are defensible.                                     50

    _K. Hen._ Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,
    Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,[4921]
    And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:
    Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,[4922]
    The winter coming on and sickness growing                            55
    Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.[4923]
    To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;
    To-morrow for the march are we addrest.

SCENE IV. _The_ FRENCH KING'S _Palace_.

                  _Enter_ KATHARINE _and_ ALICE.[4925]

    _Kath._ Alice, tu as été en Angleterre, et tu parles bien[4926]
    le langage.

    _Alice._ Un peu, madame.

    _Kath._ Je te prie, m'enseignez; il faut que j'apprenne à
    parler. Comment appelez-vous la main en Anglois?                      5

    _Alice._ La main? elle est appelée de hand.

    _Kath._ De hand. Et les doigts?

    _Alice._ Les doigts? ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je
    me souviendrai. Les doigts? je pense qu'ils sont appelés
    de fingres; oui, de fingres.                                         10

    _Kath._ La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je
    pense que je suis le bon écolier; j'ai gagné deux mots
    d'Anglois vîtement. Comment appelez-vous les ongles?

    _Alice._ Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.

    _Kath._ De nails. Ecoutez; dites-moi, si je parle bien:              15
    de hand, de fingres, et de nails.

    _Alice._ C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglois.

    _Kath._ Dites-moi l'Anglois pour le bras.

    _Alice._ De arm, madame.

    _Kath._ Et le coude?                                                 20

    _Alice._ De elbow.

    _Kath._ De elbow. Je m'en fais la répétition de tous
    les mots que vous m'avez appris dès à présent.

    _Alice._ Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.

    _Kath._ Excusez-moi, Alice; écoutez: de hand, de fingres,            25
    de nails, de arma, de bilbow.

    _Alice._ De elbow, madame.

    _Kath._ O Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie! de elbow.
    Comment appelez-vous le col?

    _Alice._ De neck, madame.                                            30

    _Kath._ De nick. Et le menton?

    _Alice._ De chin.

    _Kath._ De sin. Le col, de nick; le menton, de sin.

    _Alice._ Oui. Sauf votre honneur, en vérité, vous
    prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.          35

    _Kath._ Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grace de
    Dieu, et en peu de temps.

    _Alice._ N'avez vous pas déjà oublié ce que je vous ai[4927]
    enseigné?

    _Kath._ Non, je reciterai à vous promptement: de hand,               40
    de fingres, de mails,--[4928]

    _Alice._ De nails, madame.

    _Kath._ De nails, de arm, de ilbow.

    _Alice._ Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.

    _Kath._ Ainsi dis-je; de elbow, de nick, et de sin.                  45
    Comment appelez-vous le pied et la robe?

    _Alice._ De foot, madame; et de coun.

    _Kath._ De foot et de coun! O Seigneur Dieu! ce sont
    mots de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et non
    pour les dames d'honneur d'user: je ne voudrais prononcer            50
    ces mots devant les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde.
    Foh! le foot et le coun! Néanmoins, je reciterai une autre[4929]
    fois ma leçon ensemble: de hand, de fingres, de nails, de
    arm, de elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, de coun.

    _Alice._ Excellent, madame!                                          55

    _Kath._ C'est assez pour une fois: allons-nous à dîner.

                                                        [_Exeunt._[4930]


SCENE V. _The same._

   _Enter the_ KING of FRANCE, _the_ DAUPHIN, _the_ DUKE of BOURBON,
             _the_ CONSTABLE of FRANCE, _and others_.[4931]

    _Fr. King._ 'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.

    _Con._ And if he be not fought withal, my lord,[4932]
    Let us not live in France; let us quit all,
    And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.

    _Dau._ O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,                       5
    The emptying of our fathers' luxury,[4933]
    Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,[4934]
    Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,[4935]
    And overlook their grafters?[4936]

    _Bour._ Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards![4937]         10
    Mort de ma vie! if they march along[4938]
    Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,
    To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm[4939]
    In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.[4940]

    _Con._ Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?[4941]         15
    Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,
    On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,[4942]
    Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
    A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
    Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?                        20
    And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
    Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,
    Let us not hang like roping icicles[4943]
    Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people[4944]
    Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!--[4945]             25
    Poor we may call them in their native lords.[4946]

    _Dau._ By faith and honour,
    Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
    Our mettle is bred out and they will give
    Their bodies to the lust of English youth                            30
    To new-store France with bastard warriors.

    _Bour._ They bid us to the English dancing-schools,[4937]
    And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;[4947]
    Saying our grace is only in our heels,
    And that we are most lofty runaways.                                 35

    _Fr. King._ Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:
    Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
    Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged
    More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:[4948]
    Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;[4949]                   40
    You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,
    Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;
    Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,
    Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Fauconberg,[4950]
    Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;[4951]                     45
    High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,[4952]
    For your great seats now quit you of great shames.[4953]
    Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
    With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:
    Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow                            50
    Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
    The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:
    Go down upon him, you have power enough,
    And in a captive chariot into Rouen[4954]
    Bring him our prisoner.

    _Con._                  This becomes the great.                      55
    Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
    His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
    For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
    He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
    And for achievement offer us his ransom.[4955]                       60

    _Fr. King._ Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy,
    And let him say to England that we send
    To know what willing ransom he will give.
    Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.[4954]

    _Dau._ Not so, I do beseech your majesty.                            65

    _Fr. King._ Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
    Now forth, lord constable and princes all,
    And quickly bring us word of England's fall.              [_Exeunt._


SCENE VI. _The English camp in Picardy._

             _Enter_ GOWER _and_ FLUELLEN, _meeting_.[4956]

    _Gow._ How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?

    _Flu._ I assure you, there is very excellent services[4957]
    committed at the bridge.

    _Gow._ Is the Duke of Exeter safe?                                    5

    _Flu._ The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;
    and a man that I love and honour with my soul,
    and my heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living,[4958]
    and my uttermost power: he is not--God be praised and[4959]
    blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the bridge most[4960]     10
    valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient[4961]
    lieutenant there at the pridge, I think in my very conscience[4961]
    he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is
    a man of no estimation in the world; but I did see him do
    as gallant service.[4962]                                            15

    _Gow._ What do you call him?

    _Flu._ He is called Aunchient Pistol.

    _Gow._ I know him not.

                            _Enter_ PISTOL.

    _Flu._ Here is the man.[4963]

    _Pist._ Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:[4964]              20
    The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.[4964]

    _Flu._ Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love
    at his hands.

    _Pist._ Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,[4965]
    And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,[4965][4966]                25
    And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,[4965]
    That goddess blind,[4965][4967]
    That stands upon the rolling restless stone--[4965][4967][4968]

    _Flu._ By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is
    painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to signify to[4969]    30
    you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a
    wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is
    turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and[4970]
    her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls,
    and rolls, and rolls: in good truth, the poet makes a most[4971]     35
    excellent description of it: Fortune is an excellent moral.[4971][4972]

    _Pist._ Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;[4973]
    For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:[4973][4974]
    A damned death![4973][4975]
    Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free[4973]                      40
    And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:[4973]
    But Exeter hath given the doom of death[4973]
    For pax of little price.[4973][4974]
    Therefore, go speak; the duke will hear thy voice;[4973]
    And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut[4973]                     45
    With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:[4973]
    Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.[4973]

    _Flu._ Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your
    meaning.

    _Pist._ Why then, rejoice therefore.                                 50

    _Flu._ Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at:
    for if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the
    duke to use his good pleasure, and put him to execution;[4976]
    for discipline ought to be used.[4976]

    _Pist._ Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship![4977]        55

    _Flu._ It is well.

    _Pist._ The fig of Spain!                                   [_Exit._

    _Flu._ Very good.

    _Gow._ Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I remember
    him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.                                         60

    _Flu._ I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the[4978]
    bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it is very
    well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I warrant
    you, when time is serve.

    _Gow._ Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and               65
    then goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return into
    London under the form of a soldier. And such fellows are[4979]
    perfect in the great commanders' names: and they will learn[4980]
    you by rote where services were done; at such and such a
    sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off             70
    bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy
    stood on; and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,[4981]
    which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what a[4982]
    beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of the camp[4983]
    will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits, is wonderful      75
    to be thought on. But you must learn to know such
    slanders of the age, or else you may be marvellously mistook.

    _Flu._ I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he
    is not the man that he would gladly make show to the
    world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will tell him           80
    my mind. [_Drum heard._] Hark you, the king is coming,[4984]
    and I must speak with him from the pridge.[4985]

        _Drum and Colours. Enter_ KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, _and_
                            Soldiers.[4986]

    God pless your majesty!

    _K. Hen._ How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the[4987]
    bridge?

    _Flu._ Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter                85
    has very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is gone
    off, look you; and there is gallant and most prave passages:
    marry, th' athversary was have possession of the pridge; but
    he is enforced to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of
    the pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a prave man.        90

    _K. Hen._ What men have you lost, Fluellen?

    _Flu._ The perdition of th' athversary hath been very
    great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I think the[4988]
    duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be[4989]
    executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your majesty         95
    know the man: his face is all bubukles, and whelks, and[4990]
    knobs, and flames o' fire: and his lips blows at his nose,[4991]
    and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes
    red; but his nose is executed, and his fire's out.

    _K. Hen._ We would have all such offenders so cut off:[4992]        100
    and we give express charge, that in our marches through[4992]
    the country, there be nothing compelled from the villages,[4992]
    nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided[4992]
    or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and[4992][4993]
    cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the[4992]       105
    soonest winner.[4992]

                        _Tucket. Enter_ MONTJOY.

    _Mont._ You know me by my habit.

    _K. Hen._ Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?

    _Mont._ My master's mind.

    _K. Hen._ Unfold it.                                                110

    _Mont._ Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of[4994]
    England: Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep:[4994][4995]
    advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we could[4994]
    have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not[4994]
    good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe: now we[4994]       115
    speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial: England[4994][4996]
    shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our[4994]
    sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom;[4994]
    which must proportion the losses we have borne, the[4994]
    subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which[4994]   120
    in weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.[4994]
    For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the effusion[4994]
    of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a[4994]
    number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our[4994]
    feet, but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this add[4994]      125
    defiance: and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his[4994]
    followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far my[4994]
    king and master; so much my office.[4994]

    _K. Hen._ What is thy name? I know thy quality.

    _Mont._ Montjoy.                                                    130

    _K. Hen._ Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,
    And tell thy king I do not seek him now;
    But could be willing to march on to Calais
    Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
    Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much                            135
    Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
    My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
    My numbers lessened, and those few I have
    Almost no better than so many French;
    Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,[4997]            140
    I thought upon one pair of English legs
    Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
    That I do brag thus! This your air of France
    Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.
    Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;                            145
    My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
    My army but a weak and sickly guard;
    Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
    Though France himself and such another neighbour
    Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.[4998]            150
    Go, bid thy master well advise himself:
    If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,
    We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
    Discolour: and so, Montjoy, fare you well.
    The sum of all our answer is but this:                              155
    We would not seek a battle, as we are;
    Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:[4999]
    So tell your master.

    _Mont._ I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.

                                                          [_Exit._[5000]

    _Glou._ I hope they will not come upon us now.                      160

    _K. Hen._ We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
    March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:
    Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
    And on to-morrow bid them march away.                     [_Exeunt._


SCENE VII. _The French camp, near Agincourt._[5001]

     _Enter the_ CONSTABLE of France, _the_ LORD RAMBURES, ORLEANS,
                        DAUPHIN, _with others_.

    _Con._ Tut! I have the best armour of the world.
    Would it were day![5002]

    _Orl._ You have an excellent armour; but let my horse
    have his due.

    _Con._ It is the best horse of Europe.                                5

    _Orl._ Will it never be morning?

    _Dau._ My Lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable,
    you talk of horse and armour?[5003]

    _Orl._ You are as well provided of both as any prince in
    the world.                                                           10

    _Dau._ What a long night is this! I will not change my
    horse with any that treads but on four pasterns. Ça, ha![5004]
    he bounds from the earth, as if his entrails were hairs; le[5005][5006]
    cheval volant, the Pegasus, chez les narines de feu! When[5006][5007]
    I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the           15
    earth sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his hoof
    is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.

    _Orl._ He's of the colour of the nutmeg.[5008]

    _Dau._ And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
    Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of           20
    earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient
    stillness while his rider mounts him: he is indeed a horse;
    and all other jades you may call beasts.[5009]

    _Con._ Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and
    excellent horse.                                                     25

    _Dau._ It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like
    the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces
    homage.

    _Orl._ No more, cousin.

    _Dau._ Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the                30
    rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved
    praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as fluent as the sea: turn[5010]
    the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument
    for them all: 'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and
    for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the world,           35
    familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular[5011]
    functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his
    praise, and began thus: 'Wonder of nature,'--

    _Orl._ I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.

    _Dau._ Then did they imitate that which I composed to                40
    my courser, for my horse is my mistress.

    _Orl._ Your mistress bears well.

    _Dau._ Me well; which is the prescript praise and[5012]
    perfection of a good and particular mistress.

    _Con._ Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress[5013]              45
    shrewdly shook your back.

    _Dau._ So perhaps did yours.

    _Con._ Mine was not bridled.

    _Dau._ O then belike she was old and gentle; and you
    rode, like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in           50
    your strait strossers.[5014]

    _Con._ You have good judgement in horsemanship.

    _Dau._ Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and
    ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have my
    horse to my mistress.                                                55

    _Con._ I had as lief have my mistress a jade.

    _Dau._ I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own[5015]
    hair.

    _Con._ I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a
    sow to my mistress.                                                  60

    _Dau._ 'Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement,
    et la truie lavée au bourbier:' thou makest use of any thing.[5016]

    _Con._ Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or
    any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.

    _Ram._ My lord constable, the armour that I saw in                   65
    your tent to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?

    _Con._ Stars, my lord.

    _Dau._ Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.

    _Con._ And yet my sky shall not want.

    _Dau._ That maybe, for you bear a many superfluously,[5017]          70
    and 'twere more honour some were away.

    _Con._ Even as your horse bears your praises; who would
    trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.

    _Dau._ Would I were able to load him with his desert!
    Will it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and              75
    my way shall be paved with English faces.

    _Con._ I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out
    of my way: but I would it were morning; for I would
    fain be about the ears of the English.

    _Ram._ Who will go to hazard with me for twenty[5018]                80
    prisoners?[5019]

    _Con._ You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you
    have them.

    _Dau._ 'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.                   [_Exit._

    _Orl._ The Dauphin longs for morning.[5020]                          85

    _Ram._ He longs to eat the English.

    _Con._ I think he will eat all he kills.

    _Orl._ By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.

    _Con._ Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.

    _Orl._ He is simply the most active gentleman of France.             90

    _Con._ Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.

    _Orl._ He never did harm, that I heard of.

    _Con._ Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that
    good name still.

    _Orl._ I know him to be valiant.                                     95

    _Con._ I was told that by one that knows him better
    than you.

    _Orl._ What's he?

    _Con._ Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he
    cared not who knew it.                                              100

    _Orl._ He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.[5021]

    _Con._ By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it[5021]
    but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it appears,[5021]
    it will bate.[5021]

    _Orl._ Ill will never said well.[5021]                              105

    _Con._ I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in[5021]
    friendship.'[5021]

    _Orl._ And I will take up that with, 'Give the devil his due.'[5021]

    _Con._ Well placed: there stands your friend for the devil:[5021]
    have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A pox of[5021]           110
    the devil.'[5021]

    _Orl._ You are the better at proverbs, by how much[5021]
    'A fool's bolt is soon shot.'[5021]

    _Con._ You have shot over.[5021]

    _Orl._ 'Tis not the first time you were overshot.[5021]             115

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Mess._ My lord high constable, the English lie within[5022]
    fifteen hundred paces of your tents.

    _Con._ Who hath measured the ground?

    _Mess._ The Lord Grandpré.

    _Con._ A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would                   120
    it were day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not
    for the dawning as we do.

    _Orl._ What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King
    of England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so far[5023]
    out of his knowledge!                                               125

    _Con._ If the English had any apprehension, they would
    run away.

    _Orl._ That they lack; for if their heads had any
    intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy head-pieces.

    _Ram._ That island of England breeds very valiant                   130
    creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.

    _Orl._ Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of
    a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten
    apples! You may as well say, that's a valiant flea that
    dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.[5024]                  135

    _Con._ Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the
    mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their
    wits with their wives: and then give them great meals of
    beef and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight
    like devils.                                                        140

    _Orl._ Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.

    _Con._ Then shall we find to-morrow they have only
    stomachs to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:
    come, shall we about it?

    _Orl._ It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten[5025]         145
    We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.                  [_Exeunt._

PROLOGUE.[5026]

                            _Enter_ Chorus.

    _Chor._ Now entertain conjecture of a time
    When creeping murmur and the poring dark
    Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
    From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
    The hum of either army stilly sounds,                                 5
    That the fixed sentinels almost receive
    The secret whispers of each other's watch:
    Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
    Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
    Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs                   10
    Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
    The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
    With busy hammers closing rivets up,
    Give dreadful note of preparation:
    The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,                       15
    And the third hour of drowsy morning name.[5027]
    Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
    The confident and over-lusty French
    Do the low-rated English play at dice;[5028]
    And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night[5029]                       20
    Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
    So tediously away. The poor condemned English,[5030]
    Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
    Sit patiently and inly ruminate
    The morning's danger, and their gesture sad                          25
    Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats[5031]
    Presenteth them unto the gazing moon[5032]
    So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold[5033]
    The royal captain of this ruin'd band
    Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,                      30
    Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
    For forth he goes and visits all his host,
    Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
    And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
    Upon his royal face there is no note[5034]                           35
    How dread an army hath enrounded him;
    Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
    Unto the weary and all-watched night,
    But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
    With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;                           40
    That every wretch, pining and pale before,
    Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
    A largess universal like the sun
    His liberal eye doth give to every one,
    Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,[5035]                   45
    Behold, as may unworthiness define,
    A little touch of Harry in the night.[5036]
    And so our scene must to the battle fly;
    Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
    With four or five most vile and ragged foils,                        50
    Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
    The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
    Minding true things by what their mockeries be.             [_Exit._


SCENE I. _The English camp at Agincourt._

          _Enter_ KING HENRY, BEDFORD, _and_ GLOUCESTER.[5037]

    _K. Hen._ Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;
    The greater therefore should our courage be.
    Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
    There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
    Would men observingly distil it out.                                  5
    For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,
    Which is both healthful and good husbandry:
    Besides, they are our outward consciences,
    And preachers to us all, admonishing
    That we should dress us fairly for our end.[5038]                    10
    Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
    And make a moral of the devil himself.

                           _Enter_ ERPINGHAM.

    Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
    A good soft pillow for that good white head
    Were better than a churlish turf of France.                          15

    _Erp._ Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,
    Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'

    _K. Hen._ 'Tis good for men to love their present pains[5039]
    Upon example; so the spirit is eased:[5040]
    And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,                        20
    The organs, though defunct and dead before,
    Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,
    With casted slough and fresh legerity.[5041]
    Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
    Commend me to the princes in our camp;                               25
    Do my good morrow to them, and anon
    Desire them all to my pavilion.

    _Glou._ We shall, my liege.

    _Erp._ Shall I attend your grace?

    _K. Hen._                         No, my good knight;
    Go with my brothers to my lords of England:                          30
    I and my bosom must debate a while,
    And then I would no other company.

    _Erp._ The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!

                                           [_Exeunt all but King._[5042]

    _K. Hen._ God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.

                            _Enter_ PISTOL.

    _Pist._ Qui va lá?[5043]                                             35

    _K. Hen._ A friend.

    _Pist._ Discuss unto me; art thou officer?[5044]
    Or art thou base, common, and popular?[5044]

    _K. Hen._ I am a gentleman of a company.

    _Pist._ Trail'st thou the puissant pike?                             40

    _K. Hen._ Even so. What are you?

    _Pist._ As good a gentleman as the emperor.

    _K. Hen._ Then you are a better than the king.[5045]

    _Pist._ The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,[5046]
    A lad of life, an imp of fame;[5046][5047]                           45
    Of parents good, of fist most valiant:[5046]
    I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string[5046][5048]
    I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?[5046][5049]

    _K. Hen._ Harry le Roy.

    _Pist._ Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?            50

    _K. Hen._ No, I am a Welshman.

    _Pist._ Know'st thou Fluellen?

    _K. Hen._ Yes.

    _Pist._ Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate[5050]
    Upon Saint Davy's day.[5050][5051]                                   55

    _K. Hen._ Do not you wear your dagger in your cap
    that day, lest he knock that about yours.

    _Pist._ Art thou his friend?

    _K. Hen._ And his kinsman too.

    _Pist._ The figo for thee, then!                                     60

    _K. Hen._ I thank you: God be with you!

    _Pist._ My name is Pistol call'd.                           [_Exit._

    _K. Hen._ It sorts well with your fierceness.

                  _Enter_ FLUELLEN _and_ GOWER.[5052]

    _Gow._ Captain Fluellen!

    _Flu._ So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It[5053]         65
    is the greatest admiration in the universal world, when the
    true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not
    kept: if you would take the pains but to examine the wars
    of Pompey the Great, you shall find, I warrant you, that
    there is no tiddle taddle nor pibble pabble in Pompey's              70
    camp; I warrant you, you shall find the ceremonies of the
    wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety[5054]
    of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.

    _Gow._ Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.

    _Flu._ If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating               75
    coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look
    you, be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb? in your
    own conscience, now?

    _Gow._ I will speak lower.

    _Flu._ I pray you and beseech you that you will.                     80

                                     [_Exeunt Gower and Fluellen._[5055]

    _K. Hen._ Though it appear a little out of fashion,
    There is much care and valour in this Welshman.

        _Enter three soldiers,_ JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, and
                           MICHAEL WILLIAMS.

    _Court._ Brother John Bates, is not that the morning[5056]
    which breaks yonder?

    _Bates._ I think it be: but we have no great cause to                85
    desire the approach of day.

    _Will._ We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I
    think we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?

    _K. Hen._ A friend.

    _Will._ Under what captain serve you?                                90

    _K. Hen._ Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.[5057]

    _Will._ A good old commander and a most kind
    gentleman: I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?

    _K. Hen._ Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look
    to be washed off the next tide.                                      95

    _Bates._ He hath not told his thought to the king?

    _K. Hen._ No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though[5058]
    I speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I am: the
    violet smells to him as it doth to me; the element shows to
    him as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions;     100
    his ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears
    but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted
    than ours, yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like
    wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his
    fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are: yet, in     105
    reason, no man should possess him with any appearance
    of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.

    _Bates._ He may show what outward courage he will; but
    I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in
    Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by[5059]       110
    him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.

    _K. Hen._ By my troth, I will speak my conscience of
    the king: I think he would not wish himself any where but
    where he is.

    _Bates._ Then I would he were here alone; so should he[5060]        115
    be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.[5061]

    _K. Hen._ I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him
    here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
    minds: methinks I could not die any where so contented as
    in the king's company; his cause being just and his quarrel         120
    honourable.

    _Will._ That's more than we know.

    _Bates._ Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we[5062]
    know enough, if we know we are the king's subjects: if his
    cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime           125
    of it out of us.

    _Will._ But if the cause be not good, the king himself
    hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and
    arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together[5063]
    at the latter day and cry all 'We died at such a place;' some       130
    swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives
    left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe,
    some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are
    few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably[5064]
    dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument?                 135
    Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter
    for the king that led them to it; whom to disobey were[5065]
    against all proportion of subjection.

    _K. Hen._ So, if a son that is by his father sent about
    merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the[5066]            140
    imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be
    imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a servant, under his
    master's command transporting a sum of money, be assailed
    by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities, you
    may call the business of the master the author of the               145
    servant's damnation: but this is not so: the king is not bound
    to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father
    of his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose
    not their death, when they purpose their services. Besides,[5067]
    there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to     150
    the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted
    soldiers: some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated
    and contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins
    with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars
    their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of           155
    peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
    defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they
    can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God: war
    is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that here men are
    punished for before-breach of the king's laws in now
        the[5068][5069]                                                 160
    king's quarrel: where they feared the death, they have borne[5069]
    life away; and where they would be safe, they perish: then
    if they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of their
    damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties
    for the which they are now visited. Every subject's duty is         165
    the king's; but every subject's soul is his own. Therefore
    should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his[5070]
    bed, wash every mote out of his conscience: and dying so,[5071]
    death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
    blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained: and in[5072]    170
    him that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God[5073]
    so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His
    greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.

    _Will._ 'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon[5074]
    his own head, the king is not to answer it.                         175

    _Bates._ I do not desire he should answer for me; and
    yet I determine to fight lustily for him.

    _K. Hen._ I myself heard the king say he would not be
    ransomed.

    _Will._ Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but            180
    when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we
    ne'er the wiser.

    _K. Hen._ If I live to see it, I will never trust his word
    after.

    _Will._ You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out[5075]          185
    of an elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can[5076]
    do against a monarch! you may as well go about to turn
    the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock's
    feather. You'll never trust his word after! come, 'tis a
    foolish saying.                                                     190

    _K. Hen._ Your reproof is something too round: I should
    be angry with you, if the time were convenient.

    _Will._ Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.

    _K. Hen._ I embrace it.

    _Will._ How shall I know thee again?                                195

    _K. Hen._ Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it
    in my bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I
    will make it my quarrel.

    _Will._ Here's my glove: give me another of thine.

    _K. Hen._ There.                                                    200

    _Will._ This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou
    come to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'
    by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.[5077]

    _K. Hen._ If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.

    _Will._ Thou darest as well be hanged.                              205

    _K. Hen._ Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the
    king's company.

    _Will._ Keep thy word: fare thee well.

    _Bates._ Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we
    have French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.         210

    _K. Hen._ Indeed, the French may lay twenty French[5078]
    crowns to one, they will beat us; for they bear them on[5078]
    their shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut French[5078]
    crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will be a clipper.[5078]

                                               [_Exeunt Soldiers._[5079]

    Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,[5080][5081]             215
    Our debts, our careful wives,[5081]
    Our children and our sins lay on the king![5081]
    We must bear all. O hard condition,[5081][5082]
    Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath[5081][5083]
    Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel[5081]                   220
    But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease[5081][5084]
    Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy![5081]
    And what have kings, that privates have not too,
    Save ceremony, save general ceremony?[5085]
    And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?                              225
    What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more
    Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
    What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?[5086]
    O ceremony, show me but thy worth![5086][5087]
    What is thy soul of adoration?[5088]                                230
    Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,
    Creating awe and fear in other men?
    Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
    Than they in fearing.
    What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,                    235
    But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
    And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
    Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out[5089]
    With titles blown from adulation?
    Will it give place to flexure and low bending?[5090]                240
    Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,
    Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
    That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;[5091]
    I am a king that find thee, and I know
    'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,                        245
    The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
    The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
    The farced title running 'fore the king,
    The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
    That beats upon the high shore of this world,                       250
    No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,[5092]
    Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
    Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,[5093]
    Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
    Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;[5094]             255
    Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,[5095]
    But, like a lackey, from the rise to set[5096]
    Sweats in the eye of Phœbus and all night
    Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,
    Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,[5097]                     260
    And follows so the ever-running year,
    With profitable labour, to his grave:
    And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
    Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
    Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.[5098]                      265
    The slave, a member of the country's peace,
    Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots
    What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,
    Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

                           _Enter_ ERPINGHAM.

    _Erp._ My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,[5099]         270
    Seek through your camp to find you.

    _K. Hen._                           Good old knight,[5100]
    Collect them all together at my tent:
    I'll be before thee.[5100]

    _Erp._               I shall do't, my lord.                 [_Exit._

    _K. Hen._ O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
    Possess them not with fear; take from them now                      275
    The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers[5101]
    Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,[5101][5102]
    O, not to-day, think not upon the fault[5103]
    My father made in compassing the crown!
    I Richard's body have interred new;                                 280
    And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears
    Than from it issued forced drops of blood:
    Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
    Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up
    Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built[5104]              285
    Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests[5104]
    Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;[5104]
    Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
    Since that my penitence comes after all,[5105]
    Imploring pardon.                                                   290

                          _Enter_ GLOUCESTER.

    _Glou._ My liege!

    _K. Hen._         My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay;[5106][5107]
    I know thy errand, I will go with thee:[5107]
    The day, my friends and all things stay for me.[5108]

SCENE II. _The French camp._[5109]

         _Enter the_ DAUPHIN, ORLEANS, RAMBURES, _and others_.

    _Orl._ The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords![5110]

    _Dau._ Montez à cheval! My horse! varlet! laquais! ha![5111][5112]

    _Orl._ O brave spirit![5111]

    _Dau._ Via! les eaux et la terre.[5111][5113]

    _Orl._ Rien puis? l'air et le feu.[5111][5114]                        5

    _Dau._ Ciel, cousin Orleans.[5111][5115]

                        _Enter_ CONSTABLE.[5111]

    Now, my lord constable![5111]

    _Con._ Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh![5111]

    _Dau._ Mount them, and make incision in their hides,[5111]
    That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,[5111]                 10
    And dout them with superfluous courage, ha![5111][5116]

    _Ram._ What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?[5111]
    How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?[5111]

                        _Enter_ Messenger.[5111]

    _Mess._ The English are embattled, you French peers.[5111][5117]

    _Con._ To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!             15
    Do but behold yon poor and starved band,
    And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
    Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
    There is not work enough for all our hands;
    Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins                        20
    To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,[5118]
    That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
    And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,[5119]
    The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
    'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,[5120]                   25
    That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
    Who in unnecessary action swarm
    About our squares of battle, were enow[5121]
    To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
    Though we upon this mountain's basis by                              30
    Took stand for idle speculation:
    But that our honours must not. What's to say?
    A very little little let us do,
    And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
    The tucket sonance and the note to mount;[5122]                      35
    For our approach shall so much dare the field
    That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

                           _Enter_ GRANDPRE.

    _Grand._ Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?
    Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
    Ill-favouredly become the morning field:                             40
    Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
    And our air shakes them passing scornfully:
    Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
    And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:
    The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,                            45
    With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades[5123]
    Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,[5124]
    The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes,
    And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit[5125]
    Lies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless;                   50
    And their executors, the knavish crows,
    Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.[5126]
    Description cannot suit itself in words
    To demonstrate the life of such a battle[5127]
    In life so lifeless as it shows itself.[5128]                        55

    _Con._ They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.[5129]

    _Dau._ Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
    And give their fasting horses provender,
    And after fight with them?

    _Con._ I stay but for my guidon: to the field![5130][5131]           60
    I will the banner from a trumpet take,[5130]
    And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
    The sun is high, and we outwear the day.                  [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _The English camp._[5132]

                 host_: SALISBURY _and_ WESTMORELAND.

    _Glou._ Where is the king?

    _Bed._ The king himself is rode to view their battle.

    _West._ Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.

    _Exe._ There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.[5133]

    _Sal._ God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.                 5
    God be wi' you, princes all; I'll to my charge:[5134]
    If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
    Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,
    My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
    And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!                            10

    _Bed._ Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!

    _Exe._ Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:
    And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,[5135]
    For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.[5135]

                                                [_Exit Salisbury._[5136]

    _Bed._ He is as full of valour as of kindness;                       15
    Princely in both.

                           _Enter the_ KING.

    _West._           O that we now had here
    But one ten thousand of those men in England
    That do no work to-day!

    _K. Hen._               What's he that wishes so?
    My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:[5137]
    If we are mark'd to die, we are enow[5138]                           20
    To do our country loss; and if to live,
    The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
    God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
    By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,[5139]
    Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;                               25
    It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
    Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
    But if it be a sin to covet honour,
    I am the most offending soul alive.
    No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:[5140]                30
    God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
    As one man more, methinks, would share from me
    For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more![5141]
    Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
    That he which hath no stomach to this fight,                         35
    Let him depart; his passport shall be made
    And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
    We would not die in that man's company
    That fears his fellowship to die with us.
    This day is call'd the feast of Crispian:                            40
    He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
    Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,
    And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
    He that shall live this day, and see old age,[5142]
    Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,[5143]                 45
    And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
    Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
    And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'[5144]
    Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,[5145]
    But he'll remember with advantages[5145]                             50
    What feats he did that day: then shall our names,[5146]
    Familiar in his mouth as household words,[5147]
    Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
    Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
    Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.                         55
    This story shall the good man teach his son;
    And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
    From this day to the ending of the world,
    But we in it shall be remembered;
    We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;                           60
    For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
    Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
    This day shall gentle his condition:
    And gentlemen in England now a-bed
    Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,                  65
    And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks[5148]
    That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

                      _Re-enter_ SALISBURY.[5149]

    _Sal._ My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:
    The French are bravely in their battles set,[5150]
    And will with all expedience charge on us.                           70

    _K. Hen._ All things are ready, if our minds be so.

    _West._ Perish the man whose mind is backward now!

    _K. Hen._ Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?[5151]

    _West._ God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,
    Without more help, could fight this royal battle![5152]              75

    _K. Hen._ Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;[5153]
    Which likes me better than to wish us one.
    You know your places: God be with you all!

                        _Tucket. Enter_ MONTJOY.

    _Mont._ Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,[5154]
    If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,                            80
    Before thy most assured overthrow:
    For certainly thou art so near the gulf,
    Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,[5155]
    The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
    Thy followers of repentance; that their souls                        85
    May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
    From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies
    Must lie and fester.

    _K. Hen._            Who hath sent thee now?

    _Mont._ The Constable of France.

    _K. Hen._ I pray thee, bear my former answer back:                   90
    Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
    Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
    The man that once did sell the lion's skin
    While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
    A many of our bodies shall no doubt[5156]                            95
    Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
    Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:
    And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
    Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
    They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,            100
    And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;
    Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
    The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
    Mark then abounding valour in our English,[5157][5158]
    That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,[5157][5159]          105
    Break out into a second course of mischief,[5157]
    Killing in relapse of mortality.[5157][5160]
    Let me speak proudly: tell the constable
    We are but warriors for the working-day;
    Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd                         110
    With rainy marching in the painful field;
    There's not a piece of feather in our host--
    Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
    And time hath worn us into slovenry:
    But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;                       115
    And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
    They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck[5161]
    The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
    And turn them out of service. If they do this,--[5162]
    As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then[5163]                120
    Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;[5164]
    Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:
    They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
    Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,[5165]
    Shall yield them little, tell the constable.[5166]                  125

    _Mont._ I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
    Thou never shalt hear herald any more.                      [_Exit._

    _K. Hen._ I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.[5167]

                             _Enter_ YORK.

    _York._ My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
    The leading of the vaward.                                          130

    _K. Hen._ Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away:
    And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!              [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _The field of battle._[5168]

     _Alarum. Excursions. Enter_ PISTOL, French Soldier, _and_ Boy.

    _Pist._ Yield, cur!

    _Fr. Sol._ Je pense que vous êtes gentilhomme de bonne[5169]
    qualité.

    _Pist._ Qualtitie calmie custure me! Art thou a gentleman?[5170]
    what is thy name? discuss.                                            5

    _Fr. Sol._ O Seigneur Dieu!

    _Pist._ O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman:[5171]
    Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark;[5171]
    O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,[5171][5172]
    Except, O signieur, thou do give to me[5171]                         10
    Egregious ransom.[5171]

    _Fr. Sol._ O, prenez miséricorde! ayez pitié de moi!

    _Pist._ Moy shall not serve; I will have forty moys;[5173]
    Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat[5173][5174]
    In drops of crimson blood.[5173]                                     15

    _Fr. Sol._ Est-il impossible d'échapper la force de ton
    bras?

    _Pist._ Brass, cur![5175]
    Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,[5175]
    Offer'st me brass?[5175]                                             20

    _Fr. Sol._ O pardonnez moi!

    _Pist._ Say'st thou me so? is that a ton of moys?[5176]
    Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French[5176]
    What is his name.[5176]

    _Boy._ Écoutez: comment êtes-vous appelé?                            25

    _Fr. Sol._ Monsieur le Fer.

    _Boy._ He says his name is Master Fer.

    _Pist._ Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferret
    him: discuss the same in French unto him.

    _Boy._ I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and             30
    firk.

    _Pist._ Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.

    _Fr. Sol._ Que dit-il, monsieur?

    _Boy._ Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites
    vous prèt; car ce soldat ici est disposé tout à cette heure[5177]    35
    de couper votre gorge.

    _Pist._ Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,[5178]
    Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;[5178][5179]
    Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.[5178]

    _Fr. Sol._ O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me              40
    pardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison: gardez[5180]
    ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents écus.

    _Pist._ What are his words?

    _Boy._ He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman
    of a good house; and for his ransom he will give you two             45
    hundred crowns.

    _Pist._ Tell him my fury shall abate, and I[5181]
    The crowns will take.[5181]

    _Fr. Sol._ Petit monsieur, que dit-il?

    _Boy._ Encore qu'il est centre son jurement de pardonner             50
    aucun prisonnier, néanmoins, pour les écus que vous
    l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la liberté, le
    franchisement.

    _Fr. Sol._ Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercîmens;
    et je m'estime heureux que je suis tombé entre les[5182]             55
    mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave, vaillant, et
    très distingué seigneur d'Angleterre.

    _Pist._ Expound unto me, boy.

    _Boy._ He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks;
    and he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into the[5183]      60
    hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave, valorous, and
    thrice-worthy signieur of England.

    _Pist._ As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.[5184]
    Follow me![5185]

    _Boy._ Suivez-vous le grand capitaine. [_Exeunt Pistol,[5186]_       65
    _and French Soldier._] I did never know so full a voice[5187]
    issue from so empty a heart: but the saying is true, 'The[5188]
    empty vessel makes the greatest sound.' Bardolph and
    Nym had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i'
    the old play, that every one may pare his nails with a[5189]         70
    wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and so would[5190]
    this be, if he durst steal any thing adventurously. I must
    stay with the lackeys, with the luggage of our camp: the
    French might have a good prey of us, if he knew of it; for[5191]
    there is none to guard it but boys.                        [_Exit._  75


SCENE V. _Another part of the field._

  _Enter_ CONSTABLE, ORLEANS, BOURBON, DAUPHIN, _and_ RAMBURES.[5192]

    _Con._ O diable!

    _Orl._ O seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!

    _Dau._ Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all![5193]
    Reproach and everlasting shame[5194]
    Sits mocking in our plumes. O méchante fortune![5195]                 5
    Do not run away.[5195]      [_A short alarum._

    _Con._           Why, all our ranks are broke.

    _Dau._ O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.
    Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?

    _Orl._ Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?

    _Bour._ Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!                  10
    Let us die in honour: once more back again;[5196]
    And he that will not follow Bourbon now,[5197]
    Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand,
    Like a base pander, hold the chamber-door
    Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,[5198]                     15
    His fairest daughter is contaminated.[5199]

    _Con._ Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now!
    Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.[5200]

    _Orl._ We are enow yet living in the field[5201]
    To smother up the English in our throngs,                            20
    If any order might be thought upon.

    _Bour._ The devil take order now! I'll to the throng:
    Let life be short; else shame will be too long.           [_Exeunt._


SCENE VI. _Another part of the field._

 _Alarums. Enter_ KING HENRY _and forces_, EXETER, _and others_.[5202]

    _K. Hen._ Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:
    But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.[5203]

    _Exe._ The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.

    _K. Hen._ Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour
    I saw him down; thrice up again, and fighting;                        5
    From helmet to the spur all blood he was.[5204]

    _Exe._ In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
    Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,[5205]
    Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
    The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.                                 10
    Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
    Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
    And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes
    That bloodily did yawn upon his face;
    And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk![5206]                   15
    My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;[5207]
    Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
    As in this glorious and well-foughten field
    We kept together in our chivalry!'
    Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:                          20
    He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,[5208]
    And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,
    Commend my service to my sovereign.'
    So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
    He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;                        25
    And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd
    A testament of noble-ending love.[5209]
    The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
    Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
    But I had not so much of man in me,                                  30
    And all my mother came into mine eyes[5210]
    and gave me up to tears.

    _K. Hen._                I blame you not;
    For, hearing this, I must perforce compound
    With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.[5211]      [_Alarum._
    But, hark! what new alarum is this same?[5212]                       35
    The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:[5213][5214]
    Then every soldier kill his prisoners;[5213][5215]
    Give the word through.                              [_Exeunt._[5216]


SCENE VII. _Another part of the field._

                  _Enter_ FLUELLEN _and_ GOWER.[5217]

    _Flu._ Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly against
    the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of knavery, mark you
    now, as can be offer't; in your conscience, now, is it not?[5218]

    _Gow._ 'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the
    cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this               5
    slaughter: besides, they have burned and carried away all[5219]
    that was in the king's tent; wherefore the king, most worthily,
    hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat.
    O, 'tis a gallant king!

    _Flu._ Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower.                   10
    What call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig
    was born?

    _Gow._ Alexander the Great.

    _Flu._ Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or
    the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous,           15
    are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a little
    variations.

    _Gow._ I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon:
    his father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.

    _Flu._ I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn.             20
    I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the 'orld, I
    warrant you sall find, in the comparisons between Macedon[5220]
    and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both
    alike. There is a river in Macedon; and there is also moreover[5221]
    a river at Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth;                   25
    but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other
    river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is to my
        fingers,[5222]
    and there is salmons in both. If you mark Alexander's
    life well, Harry of Monmouth's life is come after
    it indifferent well; for there is figures in all things. Alexander,  30
    God knows, and you know, in his rages, and his
    furies, and his wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and
    his displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a
    little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers,
    look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.[5223]                       35

    _Gow._ Our king is not like him in that: he never killed
    any of his friends.

    _Flu._ It is not well done, mark you now, to take the
    tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I[5224]
    speak but in the figures and comparisons of it: as Alexander[5225]   40
    killed his friend Cleitus, being in his ales and his[5223]
    cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in his right wits and
    his good judgements, turned away the fat knight with the[5226]
    great belly-doublet: he was full of jests, and gipes, and
    knaveries, and mocks; I have forgot his name.[5227]                  45

    _Gow._ Sir John Falstaff.

    _Flu._ That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn
    at Monmouth.

    _Gow._ Here comes his majesty.

     _Alarum. Enter_ KING HENRY, _and forces_; WARWICK, GLOUCESTER,
                      EXETER, _and others_.[5228]

    _K. Hen._ I was not angry since I came to France[5229][5230]         50
    Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;[5230]
    Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:[5230]
    If they will fight with us, bid them come down,[5230]
    Or void the field; they do offend our sight:[5230]
    If they'll do neither, we will come to them,[5230]                   55
    And make them skirr away, as swift as stones[5230][5231]
    Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:[5230]
    Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,[5230]
    And not a man of them that we shall take[5230]
    Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.[5230]                    60

                            _Enter_ MONTJOY.

    _Exe._ Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.

    _Glo._ His eyes are humbler than they used to be.

    _K. Hen._ How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not[5232]
    That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
    Comest thou again for ransom?

    _Mont._                       No, great king:                        65
    I come to thee for charitable license,
    That we may wander o'er this bloody field
    To look our dead, and then to bury them;[5233]
    To sort our nobles from our common men.
    For many of our princes--woe the while!--                            70
    Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;
    So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
    In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds[5234]
    Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
    Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,                    75
    Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
    To view the field in safety and dispose
    Of their dead bodies!

    _K. Hen._             I tell thee truly, herald,
    I know not if the day be ours or no;
    For yet a many of your horsemen peer[5235]                           80
    And gallop o'er the field.

    _Mont._                    The day is yours.

    _K. Hen._ Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
    What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?

    _Mont._ They call it Agincourt.

    _K. Hen._ Then call we this the field of Agincourt,                  85
    Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.

    _Flu._ Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please
    your majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack
    Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles, fought a
    most prave pattle here in France.                                    90

    _K. Hen._ They did, Fluellen.

    _Flu._ Your majesty says very true: if your majesties[5236]
    is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a
    garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth
    caps; which, your majesty know, to this hour is an[5237]             95
    honourable badge of the service; and I do believe your majesty
    takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day.

    _K. Hen._ I wear it for a memorable honour;
    For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.

    _Flu._ All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's              100
    Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that: God
    pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases his grace, and[5238]
    his majesty too!

    _K. Hen._ Thanks, good my countryman.[5239]

    _Flu._ By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I                  105
    care not who know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: I
    need not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised be God,
    so long as your majesty is an honest man.

    _K. Hen._ God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:[5240]
    Bring me just notice of the numbers dead                            110
    On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.

               [_Points to Williams. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy._[5241]

    _Exe._ Soldier, you must come to the king.[5242]

    _K. Hen._ Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?

    _Will._ An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one[5243]
    that I should fight withal, if he be alive.                         115

    _K. Hen._ An Englishman?

    _Will._ An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered[5243]
    with me last night; who, if alive and ever dare to challenge[5244]
    this glove, I have sworn to take him a box o' th' ear: or if I[5245]
    can see my glove in his cap, which he swore, as he was a            120
    soldier, he would wear if alive, I will strike it out soundly.

    _K. Hen._ What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit
    this soldier keep his oath?

    _Flu._ He is a craven and a villain else, an't please your[5246]
    majesty, in my conscience.                                          125

    _K. Hen._ It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great
    sort, quite from the answer of his degree.

    _Flu._ Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is,
    as Lucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, look your
    grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: if he be perjured,        130
    see you now, his reputation is as arrant a villain and a
    Jacksauce, as ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground[5247]
    and his earth, in my conscience, la!

    _K. Hen._ Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest
    the fellow.                                                         135

    _Will._ So I will, my liege, as I live.

    _K. Hen._ Who servest thou under?

    _Will._ Under Captain Gower, my liege.

    _Flu._ Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge
    and literatured in the wars.[5248]                                  140

    _K. Hen._ Call him hither to me, soldier.

    _Will._ I will, my liege.                                   [_Exit._

    _K. Hen._ Here, Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me
    and stick it in thy cap: when Alençon and myself were
    down together, I plucked this glove from his helm: if any           145
    man challenge this, he is a friend to Alençon, and an enemy
    to our person; if thou encounter any such, apprehend him,
    an thou dost me love.[5249]

    _Flu._ Your grace doo's me as great honours as can be[5250]
    desired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fain see the         150
    man, that has but two legs, that shall find himself aggriefed[5251]
    at this glove; that is all; but I would fain see it once,[5252]
    an please God of his grace that I might see.[5253]

    _K. Hen._ Knowest thou Gower?

    _Flu._ He is my dear friend, an please you.[5254]                   155

    _K. Hen._ Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my
    tent.

    _Flu._ I will fetch him.                                    [_Exit._

    _K. Hen._ My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,
    Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:                               160
    The glove which I have given him for a favour
    May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;[5245]
    It is the soldier's; I by bargain should
    Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:
    If that the soldier strike him, as I judge                          165
    By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,[5255]
    Some sudden mischief may arise of it;
    For I do know Fluellen valiant
    And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,
    And quickly will return an injury:[5256]                            170
    Follow, and see there be no harm between them.[5257]
    Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.[5258]      [_Exeunt._

    majesty's name, apprehend him: he's a friend of the Duke
    Alençon's.

                   _Enter_ WARWICK _and_ GLOUCESTER.

    it!--a most contagious treason come to light, look you, as           20
    you shall desire in a summer's day. Here is his majesty.[5263]

                    _Enter_ KING HENRY _and_ EXETER.

    _K. Hen._ How now! what's the matter?

    your grace, has struck the glove which your majesty is
    take out of the helmet of Alençon.                                   25

    _Will._ My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow
    of it; and he that I gave it to in change promised to wear
    it in his cap: I promised to strike him, if he did: I met
    this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as[5264]
    good as my word.                                                     30

    _Flu._ Your majesty hear now, saving your majesty's
    manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy knave
    it is: I hope your majesty is pear me testimony and witness,[5265]
    and will avouchment, that this is the glove of Alençon,[5265]
    that your majesty is give me; in your conscience, now?               35

    _K. Hen._ Give me thy glove, soldier: look, here is the[5266][5267]
    fellow of it.[5266]
    'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike;[5268][5269]
    And thou hast given me most bitter terms.[5268]

    _Flu._ An please your majesty, let his neck answer for[5270]         40
    it, if there is any martial law in the world.

    _K. Hen._ How canst thou make me satisfaction?

    _Will._ All offences, my lord, come from the heart:[5271]
    never came any from mine that might offend your majesty.

    _K. Hen._ It was ourself thou didst abuse.                           45

    _Will._ Your majesty came not like yourself: you appeared
    to me but as a common man; witness the night, your
    garments, your lowliness; and what your highness suffered
    under that shape, I beseech you take it for your own fault[5272]
    and not mine: for had you been as I took you for, I made[5273]       50
    no offence; therefore, I beseech your highness, pardon me.

    And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;[5274]

    Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns:                         55
    And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

    _Flu._ By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle
    enough in his belly. Hold, there is twelve pence for you;[5275]
    and I pray you to serve Got, and keep you out of prawls,
    and prabbles, and quarrels, and dissensions, and, I warrant          60
    you, it is the better for you.

    _Will._ I will none of your money.

    _Flu._ It is with a good will; I can tell you, it will serve
    you to mend your shoes: come, wherefore should you be
    so pashful? your shoes is not so good: 'tis a good silling,          65

PROLOGUE.[5295]

                            _Enter_ Chorus.

    _Chor._ Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,[5296]
    That I may prompt them: and of such as have,[5297]
    I humbly pray them to admit the excuse
    Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
    Which cannot in their huge and proper life                            5
    Be here presented. Now we bear the king
    Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,[5298]
    Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
    Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
    Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,[5299]              10
    Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth'd sea,
    Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king
    Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,
    And solemnly see him set on to London.
    So swift a pace hath thought that even now                           15
    You may imagine him upon Blackheath;
    Where that his lords desire him to have borne
    His bruised helmet and his bended sword
    Before him through the city: he forbids it,
    Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;                    20
    Giving full trophy, signal and ostent
    Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
    In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
    How London doth pour out her citizens!
    The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,                         25
    Like to the senators of the antique Rome,[5300]
    With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
    Go forth and fetch their conquering Cæsar in:
    As, by a lower but loving likelihood,[5301]
    Were now the general of our gracious empress,                        30
    As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,
    Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
    How many would the peaceful city quit,
    To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
    Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;                        35
    As yet the lamentation of the French[5302]
    Invites the King of England's stay at home;[5303]
    The emperor's coming in behalf of France,[5304]
    To order peace between them; and omit[5305]
    All the occurrences, whatever chanced,                               40
    Till Harry's back-return again to France:
    There must we bring him; and myself have play'd
    The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.
    Then brook abridgement, and your eyes advance,
    After your thoughts, straight back again to France.        [_Exit._  45

    _Gow._ Nay, that's right; but why wear you your leek
    to-day? Saint Davy's day is past.[5307]

    _Flu._ There is occasions and causes why and wherefore
    in all things: I will tell you, asse my friend, Captain Gower:[5308]
    the rascally, scald, beggarly, lousy, pragging knave, Pistol,         5
    which you and yourself and all the world know to be no[5309]
    petter than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is
    come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look
    you, and bid me eat my leek: it was in a place where I
    could not breed no contention with him; but I will be so[5310]       10
    bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again, and

    my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat, look
    you, this leek: because, look you, you do not love it, nor[5316]
    your affections and your appetites and your disgestions[5317]
    doo's not agree with it, I would desire you to eat it.[5318]

    _Pist._ Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.                       25

    _Flu._ There is one goat for you. [_Strikes him._] Will[5319]
    you be so good, scauld knave, as eat it?

    _Pist._ Base Trojan, thou shalt die.

    _Flu._ You say very true, scauld knave, when God's will
    is: I will desire you to live in the mean time, and eat your         30
    victuals: come, there is sauce for it. [_Strikes him._] You[5320]
    called me yesterday mountain-squire; but I will make you
    to-day a squire of low degree. I pray you, fall to: if you[5321]
    can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.

    _Gow._ Enough, captain: you have astonished him.                     35

    _Flu._ I say, I will make him eat some part of my leek,
    or I will peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you; it is[5322]
    good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.

    _Pist._ Must I bite?

    _Flu._ Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question[5323]    40
    too, and ambiguities.

    _Pist._ By this leek, I will most horribly revenge: I eat[5324][5325]
    and eat, I swear--[5325]

    _Flu._ Eat, I pray you: will you have some more sauce
    to your leek? there is not enough leek to swear by.                  45

    _Pist._ Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.

    _Flu._ Much good do you, scauld knave, heartily. Nay,
    pray you, throw none away; the skin is good for your
    broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see leeks
    hereafter, I pray you, mock at 'em; that is all.[5326]               50

    _Pist._ Good.

    _Flu._ Ay, leeks is good: hold you, there is a groat to
    heal your pate.

    _Pist._ Me a groat!

    _Flu._ Yes, verily and in truth, you shall take it; or I             55
    have another leek in my pocket, which you shall eat.

    _Pist._ I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.

    _Flu._ If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in cudgels:
    you shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me
    but cudgels. God b' wi' you, and keep you, and heal your[5327]       60
    pate.                                                       [_Exit._

    _Pist._ All hell shall stir for this.

    _Gow._ Go, go; you are a counterfeit cowardly knave.
    Will you mock at an ancient tradition, begun upon an[5328]
    honourable respect, and worn as a memorable trophy of                65
    predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds
    any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and galling
    at this gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because
    he could not speak English in the native garb, he could not
    therefore handle an English cudgel: you find it otherwise;[5329]     70
    and henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good
    English condition. Fare ye well.[5330]      [_Exit._

    _Pist._ Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?[5331]
    News have I, that my Doll is dead i' the spital[5331][5332]
    Of malady of France;[5331][5333]                                     75
    And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.[5331]
    Old I do wax; and from my weary limbs[5331]
    Honour is cudgelled. Well, bawd I'll turn,[5331][5334]
    And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.[5331]
    To England will I steal, and there I'll steal:                       80
    And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars,[5335]
    And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.[5336]      [_Exit._


SCENE II. _France. A royal palace._

    _Enter, at one door,_ KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER,
        WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, _and other_ Lords; _at another,
        the_ FRENCH KING, QUEEN ISABEL, _the_ PRINCESS KATHARINE,
        ALICE _and other_ Ladies; _the_ DUKE of BURGUNDY, _and his
        train._[5337]

    _K. Hen._ Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!
    Unto our brother France, and to our sister,
    Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes
    To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;
    And, as a branch and member of this royalty,                          5
    By whom this great assembly is contrived,
    We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;[5338]
    And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!

    _Fr. King._ Right joyous are we to behold your face,
    Most worthy brother England; fairly met:[5339]                       10
    So are you, princes English, every one.

    _Q. Isa._ So happy be the issue, brother England,[5340]
    Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,
    As we are now glad to behold your eyes;
    Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them[5341]                   15
    Against the French, that met them in their bent,[5341]
    The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:
    The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,
    Have lost their quality, and that this day[5342]
    Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.                      20

    _K. Hen._ To cry amen to that, thus we appear.

    _Q. Isa._ You English princes all, I do salute you.

    _Bur._ My duty to you both, on equal love,
    Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,[5343]
    With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,                    25
    To bring your most imperial majesties
    Unto this bar and royal interview,
    Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.[5344]
    Since then my office hath so far prevail'd
    That, face to face and royal eye to eye,                             30
    You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,
    If I demand, before this royal view,
    What rub or what impediment there is,
    Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,
    Dear nurse of arts, plenties and joyful births,                      35
    Should not in this best garden of the world
    Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?[5345]
    Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,
    And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
    Corrupting in its own fertility.[5346]                               40
    Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
    Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,[5347]
    Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,
    Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas
    The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory[5348]                          45
    Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts[5349]
    That should deracinate such savagery;
    The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
    The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,
    Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,[5350]                     50
    Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
    But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,[5351]
    Losing both beauty and utility.
    And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,[5352][5353]
    Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,[5353][5354]            55
    Even so our houses and ourselves and children,
    Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,
    The sciences that should become our country;
    But grow like savages,--as soldiers will[5355]
    That nothing do but meditate on blood,--                             60
    To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire[5356]
    And every thing that seems unnatural,
    Which to reduce into our former favour
    You are assembled: and my speech entreats
    That I may know the let, why gentle Peace                            65
    Should not expel these inconveniences
    And bless us with her former qualities.

    _K. Hen._ If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,[5357]
    Whose want gives growth to the imperfections
    Which you have cited, you must buy that peace                        70
    With full accord to all our just demands;
    Whose tenours and particular effects[5358]
    You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.

    _Bur._ The king hath heard them; to the which as yet
    There is no answer made.

    _K. Hen._                Well then the peace,                        75
    Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.

    _Fr. King._ I have but with a cursorary eye[5359]
    O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace
    To appoint some of your council presently
    To sit with us once more, with better heed[5360]                     80
    To re-survey them, we will suddenly
    Pass our accept and peremptory answer.[5361]

    _K. Hen._ Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,
    And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,[5362]
    Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;[5363]                      85
    And take with you free power to ratify,
    Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best
    Shall see advantageable for our dignity,[5364]
    Any thing in or out of our demands;[5365]
    And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,                    90
    Go with the princes, or stay here with us?

    _Q. Isa._ Our gracious brother, I will go with them:
    Haply a woman's voice may do some good,[5366]
    When articles too nicely urged be stood on.

    _K. Hen._ Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:               95
    She is our capital demand, comprised
    Within the fore-rank of our articles.

    _Q. Isa._ She hath good leave.

                 [_Exeunt all except Henry, Katharine, and Alice._[5367]

    _K. Hen._                     Fair Katharine, and most fair,
    Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
    Such as will enter at a lady's ear                                  100
    And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?

    _Kath._ Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak
    your England.

    _K. Hen._ O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly
    with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it       105
    brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?

    _Kath._ Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'[5368]

    _K. Hen._ An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like
    an angel.

    _Kath._ Que dit-il? que je suis semblable à les anges?              110

    _Alice._ Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.

    _K. Hen._ I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not
    blush to affirm it.

    _Kath._ O bon Dieu! les langues des homines sont
    pleines de tromperies.                                              115

    _K. Hen._ What says she, fair one? that the tongues of[5369]
    men are full of deceits?

    _Alice._ Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
    deceits: dat is de princess.[5370]

    _K. Hen._ The princess is the better Englishwoman. I'               120
    faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am
    glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if thou couldst,
    thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst
    think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no
    ways to mince it in love, but directly to say 'I love you:'         125
    then if you urge me farther than to say 'do you in faith?'
    I wear out my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do:
    and so clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?

    _Kath._ Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.[5371]

    _K. Hen._ Marry, if you would put me to verses or to                130
    dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one,
    I have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I
    have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in
    strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting[5372]
    into my saddle with my armour on my back, under the                 135
    correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap
    into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my
    horse for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and
    sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate,
    I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I              140
    have no cunning in protestation; only downright oaths,[5373]
    which I never use till urged, nor never break for urging.[5374]
    If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face
    is not worth sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for
    love of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook.         145
    I speak to thee plain soldier: if thou canst love me for this,[5375]
    take me; if not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but
    for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And[5376]
    while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined[5377]
    constancy; for he perforce must do thee right,                      150
    because he hath not the gift to woo in other places: for[5378]
    these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves
    into ladies' favours, they do always reason themselves out
    again. What! a speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a
    ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a         155
    black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow bald;
    a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow: but a
    good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or, rather, the
    sun, and not the moon; for it shines bright and never
    changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have[5379]       160
    such a one, take me; and take me, take a soldier; take a[5380]
    soldier, take a king. And what sayest thou then to my
    love? speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.

    _Kath._ Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of
    France?                                                             165

    _K. Hen._ No; it is not possible you should love the
    enemy of France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love
    the friend of France; for I love France so well that I will
    not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine: and,
    Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is[5381]       170
    France and you are mine.

    _Kath._ I cannot tell vat is dat.[5382]

    _K. Hen._ No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which
    I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married[5383]
    wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook off. Je[5384]     175
    quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez[5384][5385]
    le possession de moi,--let me see, what then? Saint Denis[5385]
    be my speed!--done votre est France et vous êtes mienne.
    It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as
    to speak so much more French: I shall never move thee in            180
    French, unless it be to laugh at me.

    _Kath._ Sauf votre honneur, le François que vous parlez,
    il est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.[5386]

    _K. Hen._ No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of
    my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs be[5387]     185
    granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand
    thus much English, canst thou love me?

    _Kath._ I cannot tell.

    _K. Hen._ Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll
    ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,                190
    when you come into your closet, you'll question this gentlewoman
    about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her
    dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart:
    but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the rather, gentle
    princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest           195
    mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tells me
    thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must
    therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not
    thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound
    a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to                  200
    Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard? shall we
    not? what sayest thou, my fair flower-de-luce?

    _Kath._ I do not know dat.

    _K. Hen._ No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise:
    do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your               205
    French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety take
    the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you, la plus
    belle Katharine du monde, mon très cher et devin déesse?[5388]

    _Kath._ Your majestee ave fausse French enough to[5389]
    deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.[5390]             210

    _K. Hen._ Now, fie upon my false French! By mine
    honour, in true English, I love thee, Kate: by which
    honour I dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood
    begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the
    poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew[5391]        215
    my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars
    when he got me: therefore was I created with a stubborn
    outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when I come to woo
    ladies, I fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax,
    the better I shall appear: my comfort is, that old age, that        220
    ill layer up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face:
    thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou
    shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better: and
    therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you have me?
    Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the thoughts of your            225
    heart with the looks of an empress; take me by the hand,
    and say 'Harry of England, I am thine:' which word thou
    shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee
    aloud 'England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine,
    and Henry Plantagenet is thine;' who, though I speak it             230
    before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou[5392]
    shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your
    answer in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy
    English broken; therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break[5393]
    thy mind to me in broken English; wilt thou have me?                235

    _Kath._ Dat is as it sall please de roi mon père.[5394]

    _K. Hen._ Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall
    please him, Kate.

    _Kath._ Den it sail also content me.[5394]

    _K. Hen._ Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you                240
    my queen.

    _Kath._ Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je
    ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant
    la main d'une de votre seigneurie indigne serviteur;[5395]
    excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon très-puissant seigneur.           245

    _K. Hen._ Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.

    _Kath._ Les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées
    devant leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.[5396]

    _K. Hen._ Madam my interpreter, what says she?

    _Alice._ Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of             250
    France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.[5397]

    _K. Hen._ To kiss.

    _Alice._ Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.

    _K. Hen._ It is not a fashion for the maids in France to[5398]
    kiss before they are married, would she say?                        255

    _Alice._ Oui, vraiment.

    _K. Hen._ O Kate, nice customs courtesy to great kings.[5399]
    Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak
    list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of manners,
    Kate; and the liberty that follows our places stops the             260
    mouth of all find-faults; as I will do yours, for upholding[5400]
    the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss:
    therefore, patiently and yielding. [_Kissing her._] You have[5401]
    witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is more eloquence in
    a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French[5402]       265
    council; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England
    than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes
    your father.

   _Re-enter the_ FRENCH KING _and his_ QUEEN, BURGUNDY, _and other_
                              Lords.[5403]

    _Bur._ God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach[5404][5405]
    you our princess English?[5405]                                     270

    _K. Hen._ I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how
    perfectly I love her; and that is good English.

    _Bur._ Is she not apt?[5406]

    _K. Hen._ Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition[5407]
    is not smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the            275
    heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit[5408]
    of love in her, that he will appear in his true likeness.

    _Bur._ Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer
    you for that. If you would conjure in her, you must make
    a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true likeness, he        280
    must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her then,
    being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of[5409]
    modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy
    in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition
    for a maid to consign to.                                           285

    _K. Hen._ Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind
    and enforces.

    _Bur._ They are then excused, my lord, when they see
    not what they do.

    _K. Hen._ Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to                  290
    consent winking.[5410]

    _Bur._ I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you
    will teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well summered[5411]
    and warm kept, are like flies at Bartholomew-tide,
    blind, though they have their eyes; and then they will              295
    endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.

    _K. Hen._ This moral ties me over to time and a hot[5412]
    summer; and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the
    latter end and she must be blind too.

    _Bur._ As love is, my lord, before it loves.                        300

    _K. Hen._ It is so: and you may, some of you, thank
    love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French
    city for one fair French maid that stands in my way.

    _Fr. King._ Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively,
    the cities turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with        305
    maiden walls that war hath never entered.[5413]

    _K. Hen._ Shall Kate be my wife?

    _Fr. King._ So please you.

    _K. Hen._ I am content; so the maiden cities you talk
    of may wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for[5414]     310
    my wish shall show me the way to my will.[5414]

    _Fr. King._ We have consented to all terms of reason.

    _K. Hen._ Is't so, my lords of England?

    _West._ The king hath granted every article:
    His daughter first, and then in sequel all,[5415]                   315
    According to their firm proposed natures.[5416]

    _Exe._ Only he hath not yet subscribed this:
    Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,
    having any occasion to write for matter of grant, shall name
    your highness in this form and with this addition, in French,       320
    Notre très-cher fils Henri, Roi d'Angleterre, Hèritier de[5417]
    France; and thus in Latin, Præclarissimus filius noster[5418]
    Henricus, Rex Angliæ, et Hæres Franciæ.

    _Fr. King._ Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,[5419]
    But your request shall make me lot it pass.                         325

    _K. Hen._ I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,
    Let that one article rank with the rest;
    And thereupon give me your daughter.[5420]

    _Fr. King._ Take her, fair, son and from her blood raise up
    Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms[5421]                     330
    Of France and England, whose very shores look pale[5422]
    With envy of each other's happiness,
    May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction
    Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
    In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance[5423]                 335
    His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.

    _All._ Amen![5424]

    _K. Hen._ Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,
    That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.             [_Flourish._

    _Q. Isa._ God, the best maker of all marriages,                     340
    Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!
    As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
    So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,
    That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,
    Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,                     345
    Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,[5425]
    To make divorce of their incorporate league;
    That English may as French, French Englishmen,[5426]
    Receive each other. God speak this Amen!

    _All._ Amen![5427]                                                  350

    _K. Hen._ Prepare we for our marriage: on which day,
    My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
    And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.[5428]
    Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;
    And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!                      360

EPILOGUE.

                         _Enter_ CHORUS.[5430]

    _Chor._ Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,
      Our bending author hath pursued the story,[5431]
    In little room confining mighty men,
      Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
    Small time, but in that small most greatly lived                      5
      This star of England: Fortune made his sword;
    By which the world's best garden he achieved,
      And of it left his son imperial lord.[5432]
    Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd King
      Of France and England, did this king succeed;                      10
    Whose state so many had the managing,
      That they lost France and made his England bleed:[5433]
    Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake,
    In your fair minds let this acceptance take.          [_Exit._[5434]

NOTES.


NOTE I.

DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. In Rowe's list, which remained uncorrected by any
editor before Capell, the Duke of Clarence is introduced and the Duke
of York is called '_Uncle_ to the king.' The list we have given differs
in a few other unimportant points from that of Rowe.

In the first Folio the title of the play is _The Life of Henry the
Fift_. The second Folio has _The Life of King Henry the Fift_. In the
Folios the play is divided into acts, but not into scenes, although
they prefix _Actus Primus, Scena Prima_, to the first act. The division
was first made by Pope.


NOTE II.

Act II. Prologue, 31, 32. Mr Knight says, "The passage is evidently
corrupt; and we believe that the two lines were intended to be erased
from the author's copy; for 'the abuse of distance' is inapplicable as
the lines stand." Mr Keightley proposes to read,

                    'and we'll digest
    The abuse of distance as we forge our play.'

We have left the reading of the Folios, as no proposed emendation can
be regarded as entirely satisfactory.


NOTE III.

II. 2. 139, 140. Malone misquotes the reading of Pope in this passage,
and his error is repeated without correction in subsequent editions.
Mr Mitford in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, Nov. 1844, proposes to read,
'To mark the full-fraught man and _least inclined_,' &c., quoting
'_inclined_' as if it were the received text. Perhaps it is a printer's
error.


NOTE IV.

II. 2. 176. Mr Collier in a note which has remained uncorrected in his
second edition says, "Malone, without any authority from Quartos or
Folios, printed 'Whose ruin you _three_ sought.'" The fact is that this
is the reading of every Folio, except the first, and of every edition,
without exception, which had appeared before Malone's.


NOTE V.

II. 3. 16. Here is Pope's note on this famous passage: 'These words
_and a table of green fields_ are not to be found in the old editions
of 1600 and 1608. This nonsense got into all the following editions by
a pleasant mistake of the Stage-editors, who printed from the common
piecemeal-written parts in the Play-house. A Table was here directed
to be brought in (it being a scene in a tavern where they drink at
parting) and this direction crept into the text from the margin.
Greenfield was the name of the Property-man in that time who furnished
implements &c. for the actors. A table of Greenfield's.'

Theobald's emendation was suggested, he says, by a marginal conjecture
in an edition of Shakespeare 'by a gentleman sometime deceased.'
_Shakespeare Restored_, p. 138.

Mr Spedding approves of _talked_ as being nearer to the _ductus
literarum_, according to the handwriting of the time. The reading
_talked_ derives some support from the following passage in the Quartos:

    'His nose was as sharpe as a pen:
    For when I saw him fumble with the sheetes,
    And talk of floures, and smile vpo his fingers ends
    I knew there was no way but one.'


NOTE VI.

II. 4. 1. We retain the reading _comes_ which is authorized by the
Folios. It is an example of the idiom mentioned in the note to _King
John_, V. 4. 14. So we find in the passage of the first and third
Quartos, corresponding to II. 4. 72, 'Cut up _this English_ short,'
and again in that corresponding to IV. 3. 69, 'The _French is_ in the
field.' See, also, IV. 4. 74.


NOTE VII.

III. 2. 18. The Quartos here read 'breaches,' not 'preaches,' and the
Folios 'breach,' not 'preach.' Throughout the speeches of Fluellen the
old copies sometimes mark the peculiarity of his pronunciation, by
using 'p' for 'b,' and 't' for 'd,' sometimes not; an inconsistency,
which Hanmer and others have attempted to correct. As a rule, we have
silently followed the first Folio. See _Merry Wives of Windsor_,
Note II. The same will apply to the Scotch of Jamy and the Irish of
Macmorris; for these dialects, which could not be represented by the
printer, were left to the actor's power of imitation.

Ritson, in his _Remarks_, p. 108, says, 'In the Folio, it is the _duke
of Exeter_ and not Fluellen, who enters and to whom Pistol addresses
himself. Shakespeare had made the alteration and the player editors
inserted it in the text, but inadvertently, left Fluellen in possession
of the margin.' No copy of any Folio with which we are acquainted bears
out Ritson's assertion. All have _Enter Fluellen_, as well as _Flu._ in
the margin. It seems to us that there is some comic humour in making
Pistol, almost beside himself with fright, endeavour to propitiate
the captain by giving him high sounding titles. The language, too, of
the exhortation is more suitable to the choleric Fluellen than to the
stately Exeter.


NOTE VIII.

III. 1. 112-114. Mr Knight, at the suggestion of a friend, transposes
this passage thus: 'Of my nation? What ish my nation? What ish my
nation? Who talks of my nation ish a villain, a bastard, and a knave,
and a rascal.' We agree with Mr Staunton's suggestion, that 'the
incoherence of the original was designed to mark the impetuosity of the
speaker.'


NOTE IX.

III. 3. 32. The editor of the variorum edition of 1803, adopting the
emendation 'deadly,' which was really Capell's conjecture, though
Malone appropriates it, makes it appear, as if on the authority of
Malone, that 'deadly' is the reading of the second Folio. We have left
unnoticed many similar errors, which run, uncorrected, through the
successive variorum editions.


NOTE X.

III. 4. 1. We content ourselves with a few specimens of the errors and
variations of the old copies in this scene. The French was set right,
or nearly so, by successive alterations made by Rowe, Pope, Theobald,
Warburton, and Capell. Some obvious corrections in the distribution of
the dialogue were made by Theobald.


NOTE XI.

III. 5. 1. The stage direction of the Folios is as follows:

_Enter the King of France, the Dolphin, the Constable of France, and
others._ To the speeches which commence lines 10 and 32 they prefix
_Brit._ But as the Duke of 'Britaine' does not appear elsewhere in the
play, and as the stage direction of the Quartos runs: _Enter King
of France, Bourbon, Dolphin, and others_, we have followed Theobald
in introducing Bourbon among the persons who enter and in assigning
the two speeches to him. 'Bourbon,' and not 'Britaine,' is mentioned
among the lords in line 41. In Holinshed (p. 1077, ed. 1577), the
Dukes of Berry and Britaine are mentioned as belonging to the French
king's council, and not the Duke of Bourbon. Shakespeare probably first
intended to introduce the Duke of Britaine, and then changed his mind,
but forgot to substitute _Bour._ for _Brit._ before the two speeches.
Rowe omitted to insert the Duke of 'Britaine' in his list of Dramatis
Personæ.


NOTE XII.

III. 5. 40. As the metre will not allow us to set _Delabreth_ right
by reading _D'Albret_, we do not see what is gained by substituting
_De-la-bret_, which is as erroneous as the word which Shakespeare
copied from Holinshed. The same chronicler afterwards calls him
_Dalbreth_. (Holinshed, ed. 1577, p. 1175 and 1176).


NOTE XIII.

III. 6. 100-106. Pope, following the Quarto to a certain extent, alters
the whole passage thus:

    'We would have such offenders so cut off,
    And give express charge that in all our march
    There shall be nothing taken from the villages
    But shall be paid for, and no French upbraided
    Or yet abused in disdainful language;
    When lenity and cruelty play for kingdoms
    The gentler gamester is the soonest winner.'


NOTE XIV.

III. 6. 111-128. Pope gives the speech as follows:

    'Thus says my King: say thou to Harry England,
    Although we seemed dead, we did but sleep:
    Advantage is a better soldier than rashness.
    Tell him we could at Harfleur have rebuk'd him,
    But that we thought not good to bruise an injury
    Till it were ripe. Now speak we on our cue,
    With voice imperial: England shall repent
    His folly, see his weakness, and admire
    Our suff'rance. Bid him therefore to consider
    What must the ransom be, which must proportion
    The losses we have born, the subjects we
    Have lost, and the disgrace we have digested;
    To answer which, his pettiness would bow under.
    First for our loss, too poor is his Exchequer;
    For the effusion of our blood, his army
    Too faint a number; and for our disgrace,
    Ev'n his own person kneeling at our feet
    A weak and worthless satisfaction.
    To this defiance add; and for conclusion,
    Tell him he hath betray'd his followers,
    Whose condemnation is pronounc'd. So far
    My King and master; and so much my office.'


NOTE XV.

IV. Prol. 45. Theobald's reading of this obscure passage is as follows:

                  'Then, mean and gentle, all
    Behold, (as may unworthiness define)
    A little touch, &c.'

In his note he says: 'The poet, first, expatiates on the real influence
that Harry's eye had on the camp: and then addressing himself to every
degree of his audience, he tells them, he'll shew (as well as his
unworthy pen and powers can describe it) a little touch, or sketch of
this hero in the night.'

Hanmer reads,

                'Then mean and gentle all
    Behold, &c.'

Capell, following substantially Theobald, reads,

                'Then, mean and gentle all,
    Behold, &c.'

Theobald supports his reading by two quotations from previous speeches
of the chorus (I. prol. 8; II. prol. 35) in which the audience are
addressed as 'gentles;' but this does not justify the supposition that
he would address any of them as 'mean.' The phrase 'mean and gentle'
appears to us to refer to the various ranks of the English army who are
mentioned in the previous line. Delius's conjecture that a line is lost
after the word 'all' seems very probable.


NOTE XVI.

IV. 1. 274, 275. Theobald says, "The poet might intend, 'Take from
them the sense of reckoning those opposed numbers; which might pluck
their courage from them.' But the relative not being expressed, the
sense is very obscure; and the following verb seems a petition, in the
imperative mood."

Perhaps a line has been lost, which, by help of the Quartos, we might
supply thus:

                            'Take from them now
    The sense of reckoning of the opposed numbers,
    _Lest that the multitudes which stand before them_
    Pluck their hearts from them.'


NOTE XVII.

IV. 2. 60. The conjectural reading, _guidon:_ for _guard: on_, which
we have adopted, and which is attributed by recent editors to Dr
Thackeray, late Provost of King's College, Cambridge, is found in
Rann's edition, without any name attached. Dr Thackeray probably made
the conjecture independently. We find it written in pencil on the
margin of his copy of Nares's Glossary, under the word 'Guard.'


NOTE XVIII.

IV. 3. 13, 14. Thirlby's emendation, which indeed seems absolutely to
be required by the context, is supported by the corresponding passage
in the Quartos:

    '_Clar._ Farewell kind Lord, fight valiantly to day,
    And yet in truth, I do thee wrong,
    For thou art made on the true sparkes of honour.'


NOTE XIX.

IV. 3. 52. We retain _his mouth_, because it gives a very complete
sense, and because the authority of the Folio is greatly superior to
that of the Quarto. The names of the King, Bedford, &c. were to be
familiar as household words in the mouth of the old veteran, that is,
spoken of every day, not on one day of the year only. The neighbours,
who had no personal recollections connected with those names, were only
reminded of them by their host on St Crispin's day.


NOTE XX.

V. 1. 73. Although it appears from line 75, 'And there my rendezvous is
quite cut off,' that Capell's emendation is what Shakespeare ought to
have written, yet as the reading 'Doll' is found throughout both the
Quartos and Folios, it is probable that the mistake is the author's
own, and therefore, in accordance with our principle, we have allowed
it to remain.


NOTE XXI.

V. 2. 174. Warburton's printer by mistake gave 'married' for
'new-married.' Johnson says: "Every wife is a married wife: I suppose
we should read 'new-married,'" which is in fact the reading of every
edition before Warburton's. In line 149, he omitted to correct
Warburton's misprint of 'Kate' for 'dear Kate.' The Doctor seems
to have collated the older editions by fits and starts, with long
intervals of laziness.


NOTE XXII.

V. 2. 176. As it is clear that the king is meant to speak bad
French, we leave uncorrected what we find in the Folios. His French
is much worse in the Quartos. In line 208, most editors, somewhat
inconsistently, leave 'mon' for 'ma' while they change 'cher' and
'devin' to 'chère' and 'divine.'


NOTE XXIII.

V. 2. 276. This curious misprint, 'hatred' for 'flattery', escaped the
notice of Pope, who repeated it in both his editions. Theobald first
pointed it out in his Letters to Warburton, _Nichols' Illustrations_,
Vol. II. p. 429.


NOTE XXIV.

V. 2. 322. Shakespeare copied both French and Latin from Holinshed,
where by mistake 'Præclarissimus' is printed for 'Præcharissimus' (p.
1207, ed. 1577). The same error is found in Hall, _Henry V._ fol. 39 b
(ed. 1550).


NOTE XXV.

V. 2. 360. The printer of the second Folio when he misread 'Sonet' for
'Senet,' probably supposed it to be the title of the poem of fourteen
lines, which the Chorus speaks, though the position of the word is
ambiguous. The printer of the fourth Folio and Rowe place it as if
it belonged to the _Enter Chorus_ rather than to the _Exeunt_. Pope
omitted the word altogether, and it did not reappear till Mr Dyce
restored it.

    Of some serious matters touching vs and _France_.

    _Bi._ God and his Angels guard your sacred throne,
    And make you long become it.                                          5

    _King._ Shure we thank you. And good my Lord proceed[5435]
    Why the Lawe _Salicke_ which they haue in _France_,
    Or should or should not, stop vs in our clayme:[5436]
    And God forbid my wise and learned Lord,
    That you should fashion, frame, or wrest the same.                   10
    For God doth know how many now in health,
    Shall drop their blood in approbation,
    Of what your reuerence shall incite vs too.
    Therefore take heed how you impawne our person,
    How you awake the sleeping sword of warre:                           15
    We charge you in the name of God take heed.
    After this coniuration, speake my Lord:
    And we will iudge, note, and beleeue in heart,
    That what you speake, is washt as pure
    As sin in baptisme.                                                  20

                                                                [_Bish._

    Then heare me gracious soueraigne, and you peeres,[5437]
    Which owe your liues, your faith and seruices
    To this imperiall throne.
    There is no bar to stay your highnesse claime to _France_
    But one, which they produce from _Faramount_,                        25
    No female shall succeed in salicke land,
    Which salicke land the French vniustly gloze
    To be the realme of _France_:
    And _Faramont_ the founder of this law and female barre:
    Yet their owne writers faithfully affirme                            30
    That the land salicke lyes in _Germany_,
    Betweene the flouds of _Sabeck_ and of _Elme_,
    Where _Charles_ the fift hauing subdude the Saxons,
    There left behind, and setled certaine French,
    Who holding in disdaine the Germaine women,                          35
    For some dishonest maners of their liues,
    Establisht there this lawe. To wit,
    No female shall succeed in salicke land:
    Which salicke land as I said before,[5438]
    Is at this time in _Germany_ called _Mesene_:                        40
    Thus doth it well appeare the salicke lawe
    Was not deuised for the realme of _France_,
    Nor did the French possesse the salicke land,
    Vntill 400. one and twentie yeares
    After the function of king _Faramont_,                               45
    Godly supposed the founder of this lawe:
    _Hugh Capet_ also that vsurpt the crowne,
    To fine his title with some showe of truth,
    When in pure truth it was corrupt and naught:
    Conuaid himselfe as heire to the Lady _Inger_,[5439]                 50
    Daughter to _Charles_, the foresaid Duke of _Lorain_,
    So that as cleare as is the sommers Sun,
    King _Pippins_ title and _Hugh Capets_ claime,
    King _Charles_ his satisfaction all appeare,
    To hold in right and title of the female:                            55
    So do the Lords of _France_ vntil this day,
    Howbeit they would hold vp this salick lawe
    To bar your highnesse claiming from the female,
    And rather choose to hide them in a net,
    Then amply to imbace their crooked causes,[5440]                     60
    Vsurpt from you and your progenitors.

    _K._ May we with right & conscience make this claime?

    _Bi._ The sin vpon my head dread soueraigne.
    For in the booke of Numbers is it writ,[5441]
    When the sonne dyes, let the inheritance                             65
    Descend vnto the daughter.
    Noble Lord stand for your owne,
    Vnwinde your bloody flagge,
    Go my dread Lord to your great graunsirs graue,[5442]
    From whom you clayme:                                                70
    And your great Vncle _Edward_ the blacke Prince,
    Who on the French ground playd a Tragedy
    Making defeat on the full power of _France,_
    Whilest his most mighty father on a hill,
    Stood smiling to behold his Lyons whelpe,                            75
    Foraging blood of French Nobilitie.[5443]
    O Noble English that could entertaine
    With halfe their Forces the full power of _France_:
    And let an other halfe stand laughing by,
    All out of worke, and cold for action.                               80

    _King._ We must not onely arme vs against the French,[5444]
    But lay downe our proportion for the Scot,[5445]
    Who will make rode vpon vs with all aduantages.

    _Bi._ The Marches gracious soueraigne, shalbe sufficient
    To guard your _England_ from the pilfering borderers.                85

    _King._ We do not meane the coursing sneakers onely,
    But feare the mayne entendement of the Scot,
    For you shall read, neuer my great grandfather
    Vnmaskt his power for _France_,
    But that the Scot on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,                        90
    Came pouring like the Tide into a breach,
    That _England_ being empty of defences,
    Hath shooke and trembled at the brute hereof.

    _Bi._ She hath bin then more feared then hurt my Lord:
    For heare her but examplified by her selfe,                          95
    When all her chiualry hath bene in _France_
    And she a mourning widow of her Nobles,
    She hath her selfe not only well defended,
    But taken and impounded as a stray, the king of Scots,
    Whom like a caytiffe she did leade to _France_,                     100
    Filling your Chronicles as rich with praise
    As is the owse and bottome of the sea
    With sunken wrack and shiplesse treasurie.

    _Lord._ There is a saying very old and true,
    If you will _France_ win,                                           105
    Then with _Scotland_ first begin:
    For once the Eagle, England being in pray,
    To his vnfurnish nest the weazel Scot[5446]
    Would suck her egs, playing the mouse in absence of the cat:
    To spoyle and hauock more then she can eat.                         110

    _Exe._ It followes then, the cat must stay at home,
    Yet that is but a curst necessitie,
    Since we haue trappes to catch the petty theeues:
    Whilste that the armed hand doth fight abroad
    The aduised head controlles at home:                                115
    For gouernment though high or lowe, being put into parts,[5447]
    Congrueth with a mutuall consent like musicke.

    _Bi._ True: therefore doth heauen diuide the fate of man in diuers
        functions.
    Whereto is added as an ayme or but, obedience:
    For so liue the honey Bees, creatures that by awe                   120
    Ordaine an act of order to a peopeld Kingdome:
    They haue a King and officers of sort,
    Where some like Magistrates correct at home:
    Others like Marchants venture trade abroad:
    Others like souldiers armed in their stings,                        125
    Make boote vpon the sommers veluet bud:
    Which pillage they with mery march bring home
    To the tent royall of their Emperour;
    Who busied in his maiestie, behold
    The singing masons building roofes of gold:                         130
    The ciuell citizens lading vp the honey,
    The sad eyde Iustice with his surly humme,
    Deliuering vp to executors pale, the lazy caning Drone.
    This I infer, that 20. actions once a foote,
    May all end in one moment.                                          135
    As many Arrowes losed seuerall wayes, flye to one marke:
    As many seuerall wayes meete in one towne:
    As many fresh streames run in one selfe sea:
    As many lines close in the dyall center:
    So may a thousand actions once a foote,                             140
    End in one moment, and be all well borne without defect.
    Therefore my Liege to _France_,
    Diuide your happy England into foure,
    Of which take you one quarter into France,
    And you withall, shall make all _Gallia_ shake.                     145

    Cannot defend our owne doore from the dogge,
    Let vs be beaten, and from henceforth lose

    _Ki._ Call in the messenger sent frō the Dolphin.                   150

    Or breake it all in peeces:

    Not worshipt with a paper Epitaph:

    Now are we well prepared to know the Dolphins pleasure,
    For we heare your comming is from him.

    _Ambassa._ Pleaseth your Maiestie to giue vs leaue                  160
    Freely to render what we haue in charge:
    Or shall I sparingly shew a farre off,
    The Dolphins pleasure and our Embassage?

    _King._ We are no tyrant, but a Christian King,
    To whom our spirit is as subiect,                                   165
    As are our wretches fettered in our prisons.
    Therefore freely and with vncurbed boldnesse
    Tell vs the Dolphins minde.

    _Ambas._ Then this in fine the Dolphin saith,
    Whereas you clayme certaine Townes in France,                       170
    From your predecessor king _Edward_ the third,
    This he returnes.
    He saith, theres nought in _France_ that can be with a nimble
    Galliard wonne: you cannot reuel into Dukedomes there:
    Therefore he sendeth meeter for your study,                         175
    This tunne of treasure: and in lieu of this,
    Desires to let the Dukedomes that you craue
    Heare no more from you: This the Dolphin saith.

    _King._ What treasure Vncle?

    _Exe._ Tennis balles my Liege.                                      180

    _King._ We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs,
    Your message and his present we accept:
    When we haue matched our rackets to these balles,
    We will by Gods grace play such a set,[5448]
    Shall strike his fathers crowne into the hazard.                    185
    Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler,
    That all the Courts of _France_ shall be disturbd with chases.
    And we vnderstand him well, how he comes ore vs
    With our wilder dayes, not measuring what vse we made of them.
    We neuer valued this poore seate of England.                        190
    And therefore gaue our selues to barbarous licence:
    As tis common seene that men are merriest when they are from home.
    But tell the Dolphin we will keepe our state,
    Be like a King, mightie and commaund,
    When we do rowse vs in throne of _France_:[5449]                    195
    For this haue we laid by our Maiestie:[5450]
    And plodded lide a man for working dayes.[5451]
    But we will rise there with so full of glory,[5452]
    That we will dazell all the eyes of _France_,
    I strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,                         200
    And tell him this, his mock hath turnd his balles to gun stones,

    According to their cause and worthinesse.                            20

    _Masha._ So seruice shall with steeled sinewes shine,

    What see you in those papers
    That hath so chased your blood out of apparance?                     55

    _Cam._ I do confesse my fault, and do submit me
    To your highnesse mercie.

    By your owne reasons is forestald and done:                          60
    You must not dare for shame to aske for mercy,
    For your owne conscience turne upon your bosomes,
    As dogs upon their maisters worrying them.
    See you my Princes, and my noble Peeres,
    These English monsters:                                              65
    My Lord of _Cambridge_ here,
    You know how apt we were to grace him,
    In all things belonging to his honour:

    Lightly conspired and sworne vnto the practices of _France_:         70
    To kill vs here in _Hampton_. To the which,
    This knight no lesse in bountie bound to vs
    Then _Cambridge_ is, haah likewise sworne.[5470]
    But oh what shall I say to thee false man,

    Can it be possible that out of thee                                  80
    Should proceed one sparke that might annoy my finger?
    Tis so strange, that tho the truth doth showe as grose
    As black from white, mine eye wil scarcely see it.
    Their faults are open, arrest them to the answer of the lawe,
    And God acquit them of their practises.                              85

    _Exe._ I arrest thee of high treason,
    By the name of _Richard_, Earle of _Cambridge_.
    I arest thee of high treason.
    By the name of _Henry_, Lord of _Masham_.
    I arest thee of high treason,                                        90
    By the name of _Thomas Gray_, knight of _Northumberland_.

    _Mash._ Our purposes God iustly hath discouered,
    And I repent my fault more then my death,
    Which I beseech your maiestie forgiue,
    Altho my body pay the price of it.                                   95

    _King._ God quit you in his mercy. Heare your sentence.[5473]
    You haue conspired against our royall person,
    Ioyned with an enemy proclaimed and fixed.
    And frō his coffers receiued the golden earnest of our death
    Touching our person we seeke no redresse.
    But we our kingdomes safetie must so tender                         101
    Whose ruine you haue sought,
    That to our lawes we do deliuer you.
    Get ye therefore hence: poore miserable creatures to your death,[5474]

    Cheerly to sea, the signes of war aduance:
    No King of England, if not King of _France_.

    _Pist._ No fur, no fur.

    _Bar._ Well sir _Iohn_ is gone. God be with him.

    _Host._ I, he is in _Arthors_ bosom, if euer any were:
    He went away as if it were a crysombd childe,[5475]                   5
    Betweene twelue and one,
    Iust at turning of the tide:
    His nose was as sharpe as a pen:
    For when I saw him fumble with the sheetes,
    And talk of floures and smile vpō his fingers ends                   10
    I knew there was no way but one.
    How now sir _Iohn_ quoth I?
    And he cryed three times, God, God, God,
    Now I to comfort him, bad him not think of God,
    I hope there was no such need.                                       15
    Then he bad me put more cloathes at his feete:[5476]
    And I felt to them, and they were as cold as any stone:
    And to his knees, and they were as cold as any stone.
    And so vpward, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone.[5477]

    _Nim._ They say he cride out on Sack.                                20

    _Host._ I that he did.

    _Boy._ And of women.

    _Host._ No that he did not.

    _Boy._ Yes that he did: and he sed they were diuels incarnat.[5478]

    _Host._ Indeed carnation was a colour he neuer loued.

    _Nim._ Well he did cry out on women.                                 26

    _Host._ Indeed he did in some sort handle women,
    But then he was rumaticke, and talkt of the whore of _Babylon._

    _Boy._ Hostes do you remember he saw a Flea stand
    Vpon _Bardolfes_ Nose, and sed it was a blacke soule                 30
    Burning in hell fire?[5479]

    That was all the wealth I got in his seruice.

    The king wil be gone from _Southampton_.                             35

    And holdfast is the onely dog my deare.                              40

    Question your grace the late Embassador,
    With what regard he heard his Embassage,
    How well supplied with aged Counsellours,

    Of lawe of nature, and of nations, longs[5483]                       35
    To him and to his heires, namely the crmvne

    From his most famed and famous ancestors,
    _Edward_ the third, he bids you then resigne
    Your crowne and kingdome, indirectly held
    From him, the natiue and true challenger.

    _King._ If not, what followes?                                       50

    _Exe._ Bloody costraint, for if you hide the crown
    Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
    Therefore in fierce tempest is he comming,
    In thunder, and in earthquake, like a _Ioue_,
    That if requiring faile, he will compell it:                         55
    And on your heads turnes he the widowes teares,

    This is his claime, his threatning, and my message.[5485]

    And any thing that may not misbecome
    The mightie sender, doth he prise you at:
    Thus saith my king. Vnles your fathers highnesse
    Sweeten the bitter mocke you sent his Maiestie,                      70
    Heele call you to so loud an answere for it,
    That caues and wombely vaultes of _France_

    In second accent of his ordenance.

    _Dol._ Say that my father render faire reply,                        75
    It is against my will:
    For I desire nothing so much,
    As oddes with England.
    And for that cause according to his youth
    I did present him with those _Paris_ balles.                         80

    _Exe._ Heele make your _Paris_ Louer shake for it,
    Were it the mistresse Court of mightie _Europe_.
    And be assured, youle finde a difference
    As we his subiects haue in wonder found:

    To the Mines, to the Duke of _Gloster_.                              25

    To come to the mines: the concuaueties is otherwise,
    You may discusse to the Duke, the enemy is digd
    Himselfe fiue yardes vnder the countermines:

    _Flew._ By Iesus thers excellēt seruice cōmitted at yᵉ bridge.

    And I worship, with my soule, and my heart, and my life,              5
    And my lands and my liuings,
    And my vttermost powers.
    The Duke is looke you,
    God be praised and pleased for it, no harme in the worell.
    He is maintain the bridge very gallently: there is an Ensigne[5494]  10
    There, I do not know how you call him, but by Iesus I think He is
        as[5495]
    valient a man as _Marke Anthonie_, he doth maintain the bridge
        most[5496]
    gallantly: yet he is a man of no reckoning: But I did see him do
        gallant
    seruice.

    The Duke of _Exeter_ doth loue thee well.                            20

    _Flew._ I, and I praise God I haue merrited some loue at his hands.

    _Pist. Bardolfe_ a souldier, one of buxsome valour,
    Hath by furious fate
    And giddy Fortunes fickle wheele,

    Fortune, looke you is painted,
    Plind with a mufler before her eyes,
    To signifie to you, that Fortune is plind:
    And she is moreouer painted with a wheele,                           30
    Which is the morall that Fortune is turning,
    And inconstant, and variation; and mutabilities:
    And her fate is fixed at a sphericall stone
    Which roules, and roules, and roules:
    Surely the Poet is make an excellēt descriptiō of Fortune.           35
    Fortune looke you is and excellent morall.[5498]

    _Pist._ Fortune is _Bardolfes_ foe, and frownes on him,
    For he hath stolne a packs, and hanged must he be:[5499]
    A damned death, let gallowes gape for dogs,
    Let man go free, and let not death his windpipe stop.                40
    But _Exeter_ hath giuen the doome of death,
    For packs of pettie price:
    Therefore go speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce,

    With edge of penny cord, and vile approach.                          45
    Speake Captaine for his life, and I will thee requite.

    _Flew._ Captain _Pistoll_, I partly vnderstand your meaning.

    _Pist._ Why then reioyce therefore.

    _Flew._ Certainly Antient _Pistol_, tis not a thing to reioyce at,
    For if he were my owne brother, I would wish the Duke                50
    To do his pleasure, and put him to executions: for look you,
    Disciplines ought to be kept, they ought to be kept.

    _Pist._ Die and be damned, and figa for thy friendship.[5500]

    _Flew._ That is good.

    _Pist._ The figge of _Spaine_ within thy Iawe.                       55

    _Flew._ That is very well.

    _Pist._ I say the fig within thy bowels and thy durty maw.

    _Exit Pistoll._

    _Fle._ Captaine _Gour_, cannot you hear it lighten & thunder?

    _Gour._ Why is this the Ancient you told me of?
    I remember him now, he is a bawd, a cutpurse.                        60

    _Flew._ By Iesus hee is vtter as praue words vpon the bridge
    As you shall desire to see in a sommers day, but its all one,
    What he hath sed to me,
    looke you, is all one.

    _Go._ Why this is a gull, a foole, a rogue that goes to the wars
    Onely to grace himselfe at his returne to London:                    65
    And such fellowes as he,
    Are perfect in great Commaunders names.
    They will learne by rote where seruices were done,
    At such and such a sconce, at such a breach,
      At such a conuoy: who came off brauely, who was shot,              70
    Who disgraced, what termes the enemie stood on.
    And this they con perfectly in phrase of warre,[5501]
    Which they trick vp with new tuned oathes, & what a berd
    Of the Generalls cut, and a horid shout of the campe
    Will do among the foming bottles and alewasht wits                   75
    Is wonderfull to be thought on: but you must learne
    To know such slaunders of this age,
    Or else you may maruellously be mistooke.

    _Flew._ Certain captain _Gower_, it is not the man, looke you,
    That I did take him to be: but when time shall serue,                80
    I shall tell him a litle of my desires: here comes his Maiestie.

             _Enter King_, Clarence, Gloster _and others_.

    _King._ How now _Flewellen_, come you from the bridge?

    _Flew._ I and it shall please your Maiestie,
    There is excellent seruice at the bridge.

    _King._ What men haue you lost _Flewellen_?                          85

    _Flew._ And it shall please your Maiestie,
    The partition of the aduersarie hath bene great,
    Very reasonably great: but for our own parts, like you now,[5502]
    I thinke we haue lost neuer a man, vnlesse it be one
    For robbing of a church, one _Bardolfe_, if your Maiestie            90
    Know the man, his face is full of whelkes and knubs,
    And pumples, and his breath blowes at his nose
    Like a cole, sometimes red, sometimes plew:
    But god be praised, now his nose is executed, & his fire out.

    _King._ We would haue all offenders so cut off,                      95
    And we here giue expresse commaundment,[5503]
    That there be nothing taken from the villages but paid for,
    None of the French abused,
    Or abraided with disdainfull language:[5504]
    For when cruelty and lenitie play for a Kingdome,                   100
    The gentlest gamester is the sooner winner.

                        _Enter French Herauld._

    _Hera._ You know me by my habit.

    _Ki._ Well thē, we know thee, what shuld we know of thee?

    _Hera._ My maisters minde.

    _King._ Vnfold it.                                                  105

    _Heral._ Go thee vnto _Harry_ of _England_, and tell him,
    Aduantage is a better souldier then rashnesse:
    Altho we did seeme dead, we did but slumber.
    Now we speake vpon our kue, and our voyce is imperiall,
    England shall repent her folly: see her rashnesse,[5505]            110
    And admire our sufferance. Which to raunsome,
    His pettinesse would bow vnder:
    For the effusion of our blood, his army is too weake:
    For the disgrace we haue borne, himselfe
    Kneeling at our feete, a weake and worthlesse satisfaction.         115
    To this, adde defyance. So much from the king my maister.

    _King._ What is thy name? we know thy qualitie.

    _Herald. Montioy_.

    _King._ Thou dost thy office faire, returne thee backe,
    And tell thy King, I do not seeke him now:[5506]                    120
    But could be well content, without impeach,
    To march on to _Callis_: for to say the sooth,
    Though tis no wisdome to confesse so much
    Vnto an enemie of craft and vantage.
    My souldiers are with sicknesse much infeebled,                     125
    My Army lessoned, and those few I haue,[5507]
    Almost no better then so many French:
    Who when they were in heart, I tell thee Herauld,
    I thought vpon one paire of English legges,
    Did march three French mens.                                        130
    Yet forgiue me God, that I do brag thus:[5508]
    Your heire of _France_ hath blowne this vice in me.[5509]
    I must repent, go tell thy maister here I am,
    My raunsome is this frayle and worthlesse body,
    My Army but a weake and sickly guarde.                              135
    Yet God before, we will come on,
    If _France_ and such an other neighbour stood in our way:
    If we may passe, we will: if we be hindered,
    We shal your tawny ground with your red blood discolour.
    So _Montioy_ get you gone, there is for your paines:[5510]          140
    The sum of all our answere is but this,
    We would not seeke a battle as we are:
    Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it.[5511]

    _Herauld._ I shall deliuer so: thanks to your Maiestie.

    _Glos._ My Liege, I hope they will not come vpon vs now.            145

    To night we will encampe beyond the bridge,
    And on to morrow bid them march away.

    _Const._ Tut I haue the best armour in the world.

    _Orleance._ You haue an excellent armour,
    But let my horse haue his due.

    _Burbon._ Now you talke of a horse, I haue a steed like the
    Palfrey of the sun, nothing but pure ayre and fire,                   5
    And hath none of this dull element of earth within him.

    _Orleance._ He is of the colour of the Nutmeg.

    And my horse is argument for them all:                               10
    I once writ a Sonnet in the praise of my horse,[5513]
    And began thus. Wonder of nature.

    _Con._ I haue heard a Sonnet begin so,
    In the praise of ones Mistresse.

    _Burb._ Why then did they immitate that                              15
    Which I writ in praise of my horse,
    For my horse is my mistresse.

    _Con._ Ma foy the other day, me thought
    Your mistresse shooke you shrewdly.

    My mistresse weares her owne haire.

    _Con._ I could make as good a boast of that,
    If I had had a sow to my mistresse.[5514]

    _Bur._ Tut thou wilt make vse of any thing.

    _Con._ Yet I do not vse my horse for my mistresse.                   25

    _Bur._ Will it neuer be morning?
    Ile ride too morrow a mile,
    And my way shalbe paued with English faces.

    _Con._ By my faith so will not I,
    For feare I be outfaced of my way.                                   30

    _Bur._ Well ile go arme my selfe, hay.

    _Gebon._ The Duke of _Burbon_ longs for morning.

    _Or._ I he longs to eate the English.

    With a logge of the diuel.

    _Or._ Well the Duke of _Burbon_, is simply,
    The most actiue Gentleman of _France_.

    _Con._ Doing his actiuitie, and heele stil be doing.

    _Or._ He neuer did hurt as I heard off.                              45

    _Con._ No I warrant you, nor neuer will.

    _Or._ I hold him to be exceeding valiant.

    _Con._ I was told so by one that knows him better the[n] you.

    _Or._ Whose that?

    _Con._ Why he told me so himselfe:                                   50
    And said he cared not who knew it.

    _Or._ Well who will go with me to hazard,
    For a hundred English prisoners?

    _Con._ You must go to hazard your selfe,
    Before you haue them.                                                55

    Paces of your Tent.

           _Enter the King disguised, to him_ Pistoll.[5517]

    _Pist._ Ke ve la?

    _King._ A friend.

    _Pist._ Discus vnto me, art thou Gentleman?
    Or art thou common, base, and popeler?

    _King._ No sir, I am a Gentleman of a Company.                        5

    _Pist._ Trailes thou the puissant pike?

    _King._ Euen so sir. What are you?

    _Pist._ As good a gentleman as the Emperour.

    _King._ O then thou art better then the King?

    _Pist._ The kings a bago, and a hart of gold.                        10

    _Pist._ A lad of life, an impe of fame:[5518]
    Of parents good, of fist most valiant:
    I kis his durtie shoe: and from my hart strings
    I loue the louely bully. What is thy name?

    _King. Harry_ le Roy.                                                15

    _Pist._ Le Roy, a Cornish man:
    Art thou of Cornish crew?

    _Kin._ No sir, I am a Wealchman.

    _Pist._ A Wealchman: knowst thou _Flewellen_?

    _Kin._ I sir, he is my kinsman.                                      20

    _Pist._ Art thou his friend?

    _Kin._ I sir.

    _Pist._ Figa for thee then: my name is _Pistoll_.

    _Kin._ It sorts well with your fiercenesse.

    _Pist. Pistoll_ is my name.                                          25

    _Exit_ Pistoll.

                      _Enter Gower and Flewellen._

    _Gour._ Captaine _Flewellen_.

    _Flew._ In the name of Iesu speake lewer.[5519]
    It is the greatest folly in the worell, when the auncient
    Prerogatiues of the warres be not kept.
    I warrant you, if you looke into the warres of the Romanes,          30
    You shall finde no tittle tattle, nor bible bable there:
    But you shall finde the cares, and the feares,
    And the ceremonies, to be otherwise.

    _Gour._ Why the enemy is loud: you heard him all night.

    _Flew._ Godes sollud, if the enemy be an Asse & a Foole,             35
    And a prating cocks-come, is it meet that we be also a foole,
    And a prating cocks-come, in your conscience now?

    _Gour._ Ile speake lower.

    _Flew._ I beseech you do, good Captaine Gower.

                      _Exit Gower, and Flewellen._

    _Kin._ Tho it appeare a litle out of fashion,                        40
    Yet theres much care in this.

                        _Enter three Souldiers._

    _1. Soul._ Is not that the morning yonder?

    _2. Soul._ I we see the beginning,
    God knowes whether we shall see the end or no.

    _3. Soul._ Well I thinke the king could wish himselfe                45
    Vp to the necke in the middle of the Thames,
    And so I would he were, at all aduentures, and I with him.

    _Kin._ Now masters god morrow, what cheare?[5520]

    _3. S._ Ifaith small cheer some of vs is like to haue,
    Ere this day ende.[5521]                                             50

    _Kin._ Why fear nothing man, the king is frolike.

    _2. S._ I he may be, for he hath no cause as we.[5522]

    _Kin._ Nay say not so, he is a man as we are.
    The Violet smels to him as to vs:[5523]
    Therefore if he see reasons, he feares as we do.                     55

    _2. Sol._ But the king hath a heauy reckoning to make,
    If his cause be not good: when all those soules
    Whose bodies shall be slaughtered here,
    Shall ioyne together at the latter day,
    And say I dyed at such a place. Some swearing:                       60
    Some their wiues rawly left:
    Some leauing their children poore behind them.
    Now if his cause be bad, I think it will be a greeuous matter to him.

    _King._ Why so you may say, if a man send his seruant
    As Factor into another Countrey,                                     65
    And he by any meanes miscarry,
    You may say the businesse of the maister,
    Was the author of his seruants misfortune.
    Or if a sonne be imployd by his father,
    And he fall into any leaud action, you may say the father            70
    Was the author of his sonnes damnation.
    But the master is not to answere for his seruants,
    The father for his sonne, nor the king for his subiects:
    For they purpose not their deaths, whē they craue their seruices:
    Some there are that haue the gift of premeditated                    75
    Murder on them:
    Others the broken scale of Forgery, in beguiling maydens.
    Now if these outstrip the lawe,
    Yet they cannot escape Gods punishment.
    War is Gods Beadel. War is Gods vengeance:                           80
    Euery mans seruice is the kings:
    But euery mans soule is his owne.
    Therfore I would haue euery souldier examine himselfe,
    And wash euery moath out of his conscience:
    That in so doing, he may be the readier for death:                   85
    Or not dying, why the time was well spent,
    Wherein such preparation was made.

    _3. Lord._ Yfaith he saies true:[5524]
    Euery mans fault on his owne head,[5525]
    I would not haue the king answere for me.                            90
    Yet I intend to fight lustily for him.

    _King._ Well, I heard the king, he wold not be ransomde.[5526]

    _2. L._ I he said so, to make vs fight:[5527]
    But when our throates be cut, he may be ransomde,
    And we neuer the wiser.                                              95

    _King._ If I liue to see that, Ile neuer trust his word againe.

    _2. Sol._ Mas youle pay him then, tis a great displeasure
    That an elder gun, can do against a cannon,
    Or a subiect against a monarke.
    Youle nere take his word again, your a nasse goe.[5528]             100

    _King._ Your reproofe is somewhat too bitter:
    Were it not at this time I could be angry.

    _2. Sol._ Why let it be a quarrell if thou wilt.

    _King._ How shall I know thee?

    _2. Sol._ Here is my gloue, which if euer I see in thy hat,[5529]   105
    Ile challenge thee, and strike thee.

    _Kin._ Here is likewise another of mine,
    And assure thee ile weare it.[5530]

    _2. Sol._ Thou dar'st as well be hangd.

    _3. Sol._ Be friends you fooles,                                    110
    We haue French quarrels anow in hand:[5531]
    We haue no need of English broyles.

    _Kin._ Tis no treason to cut French crownes,
    For to morrow the king himselfe wil be a clipper.

    Take from them now the sence of rekconing,
    That the apposed multitudes which stand before them,
    May not appall their courage.

    Now at this instant, that doth not worke in England.

    _Kin._ Whose that, that wishes so, my Cousen _Warwick_?

    One man would share from me,
    Not for my Kingdome.                                                 15

    Without more helpe, might fight this battle out.                     55

    Good God, why should they mock good fellows thus?                    65

    Throat to be cut. O he is a worthy king.                             10

    _Flew._ I he was born at _Monmorth_;[5557]
    Captain _Gower_, what call you the place where
    _Alexander_ the big was borne?

    _Gour. Alexander_ the great.

    _Flew._ Why I pray, is nat big great?[5558]                          15
    As if I say, big, or great, or magnanimous,
    I hope it is all one reconing,[5559]
    Saue the frase is a little varation.

    _Gour._ I thinke _Alexander_ the great
    Was borne at _Macedon_.                                              20
    His father was called _Philip_ of _Macedon_,
    As _I_ take it.

    _Flew. I_ thinke it was _Macedon_ indeed where _Alexander_
    Was borne: looke you captaine _Gower_,

    In _Monmorth_, the Riuers name at _Monmorth_
    Is called Wye.                                                       30

    And there is Samons in both.
    Looke you captaine _Gower_, and you marke it,
    You shall finde our King is come after _Alexander_.                  35
    God knowes, and you know, that _Alexander_ in his
    Bowles, and his alles, and his wrath, and his displeasures,
    And indignations, was kill his friend _Clitus_.

    _Gow. I_ but our King is not like him in that,
    For he neuer killd any of his friends.                               40

    _Flew._ Looke you, tis not well done to take the tale out
    O a mans mouth, ere it is made an end and finished:
    I speake in the comparisons, as _Alexander_ is kill
    His friend _Clitus_: so our King being in his ripe
    Wits and iudgements, is turne away, the fat knite                    45
    With the great belly doublet: I am forget his name.

    For _Kate_, I loue _France_ so well,
    That Ile not leaue a Village,                                        45

    _Kate._ Den _France_ sall be mine.

    _Harry._ Et Ie suyues a vous.

    _Har._ Wilt beleeue me _Kate?_ tis easier for me                     65
    To conquer the kingdome, thē to speak so much
    More French.

    _Kate._ A your Maiesty has false _France_ inough
    To deceiue de best Lady in _France_.

    _Harry._ No faith _Kate_ not I. But _Kate_,[5622]                    70
    In plaine termes, do you loue me?[5623]

    Come K_ate_, I know you loue me.                                     75
    And soone when you are in your closset,
    Youle question this Lady of me.
    But I pray thee sweete K_ate_, vse me mercifully,
    Because I loue thee cruelly.
    That I shall dye K_ate_, is sure:                                    80
    But for thy loue, by the Lord neuer.
    What Wench,
    A straightbacke will growe crooked,
    A round eye will growe hollowe,
    A great leg will waxe small,                                         85
    A curld pate proue balde:
    But a good heart Kate, is the sun and the moone,
    And rather the Sun and not the Moone:
    And therefore K_ate_ take me,
    Take a souldier: take a souldier,                                    90
    Take a King.
    Therefore tell me K_ate_, wilt thou haue me?

    K_ate._ Dat is as please the King my father.

    _Harry._ Nay it will please him:[5624]
    Nay it shall please him K_ate_.                                      95
    And vpon that condition K_ate_ Ile kisse you.

    K_a._ O mon du Ie ne voudroy faire quelke chosse[5625]
    Pour toute le monde,
    Ce ne poynt votree fachion en fouor.

    _Harry._ What saies she Lady?[5626]                                 100

    _Lady._ Dat it is not de fasion en _France_,
    For de maides, before da be married to[5627]
    May foy ie oblye, what is to bassie?

    _Har._ To kis, to kis. O that tis not the
    Fashion in _Frannce_ for the maydes to kis                          105
    Before they are married.

    _Lady._ Owye see votree grace.

    _Har._ Well, weele breake that custome.
    Therefore _Kate_ patience perforce and yeeld.
    Before God _Kate_, you haue witchcraft                              110
    In your kisses:
    And may perswade with me more,
    Then all the French Councell.
    Your father is returned.

                    _Enter the King of France, and
                             the Lordes._

    How now my Lords?                                                   115

    _Fran._ Brother of England,
    We haue orered the Articles,[5628]
    And haue agreed to all that we in sedule had.

    _Exe._ Only he hath not subscribed this,
    Where your maiestie demaunds,                                       120
    That the king of _France_ hauing any occasion
    To write for matter of graunt,
    Shall name your highnesse, in this forme:
    And with this addition in French.
    _Nostre tresher fils, Henry Roy D'anglaterre,_                      125
    _E heare de France._ And thus in Latin:
    _Preclarissimus filius noster Henricus Rex Anglie,
    Et heres Francie._

    _Fran._ Nor this haue we so nicely stood vpon,
    But you faire brother may intreat the same.                         130

    _Har._ Why then let this among the rest,
    Haue his full course: And withall,
    Your daughter _Katherine_ in mariage.

    _Fran._ This and what else,
    Your maiestie shall craue:                                          135
    God that disposeth all, giue you much ioy.

    _Har._ Why then faire _Katherine_,
    Come giue me thy hand:
    Our manage will we present solemnise,
    And end our hatred by a bond of loue.                               140
    Then will I sweare to _Kate_, and _Kate_ to mee:
    And may our vowes once made, vnbroken bee.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

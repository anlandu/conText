PREFACE.


1. The earliest edition of HAMLET appeared in 1603, with the following
title-page:

    THE | Tragicall Historie of | HAMLET | _Prince of Denmarke_
    | By William Shake-speare. | As it hath beene diuerse times
    acted by his Highnesse ser-| uants in the Cittie of London: as
    also in the two V-| niuersities of Cambridge and Oxford, and
    else-where | At London printed for N: L. and Iohn Trundell. |
    1603.

We refer to it as (Q₁).

A copy of this edition belonged to Sir Thomas Hanmer, though he does
not appear to have mentioned it in his notes to Shakespeare or in his
correspondence, and its existence was not known till his library came
into the possession of Sir E. H. Bunbury in 1821. In a copy of the
Reprint of 1825, now at Barton, Sir E. H. Bunbury wrote the following
note:

'The only copy of this edition of Hamlet (1603) which is known to be
in existence was found by me in the Library at Barton when it came
into my possession in 1821. The Hamlet was bound up with ten others of
the small 4to editions of Shakespeare's Plays (1598 to 1603) and with
The Two Noble Kinsmen (1634). Most of these were complete. I sold the
volume in Dec. 1824 for £180 to Messrs Payne and Foss, who resold it to
the Duke of Devonshire for £230.'

This copy wanted the last leaf containing the 22 concluding lines.
A second copy, wanting the title-page but otherwise perfect, was
discovered in 1856 by Mr W. H. Rooney of Dublin. 'It was bought,' says
Mr Timmins, 'by Mr Rooney from a student of Trinity College, Dublin,
who had brought it from Nottinghamshire with his other books. After
reprinting the last leaf, Mr Rooney sold the pamphlet to Mr Boone for
£70, from whom Mr J. O. Halliwell bought it for £120, and it is now in
the British Museum.'

We have reprinted this edition, and recorded in foot-notes the few
discrepancies which are found between the two copies.

An extremely accurate reprint was made from the Devonshire copy in
1825, and it was lithographed in facsimile, with the addition of the
missing leaf, in 1858, under the direction of Mr Collier and at the
expense of the Duke. In 1860 Mr J. Allen, Junr., reprinted this edition
and the Quarto of 1604, placing the corresponding passages as nearly as
possible on opposite pages, with a preface by Mr Samuel Timmins.

The edition of 1603 is obviously a very imperfect reproduction of the
play, and there is every reason to believe that it was printed from
a manuscript surreptitiously obtained. This manuscript may have been
compiled in the first instance from short hand notes taken during the
representation, but there are many errors in the printed text which
seem like errors of a copyist rather than of a hearer. Compare for
example lines 37, 38 of Scene III. of our Reprint, p. 205, with the
corresponding lines of the more perfect drama as it was printed in the
Quarto of 1604, Act I. Scene 3, lines 73, 74, p. 26.

In the Quarto of 1603 the passage runs thus:

    And they of _France_ of the chiefe rancke and station
    Are of a most select and generall chiefe in that:

In that of 1604:

    'And they in Fraunce of the best ranck and station,
    Or of a most select and generous, chiefe in that:'

It is clear that the corruption in both passages is due to an error in
the transcript from which both were copied. Probably the author had
originally written:

    'And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous in that:'

and then given between the lines or in the margin, 'of,' 'chief',
meaning these as alternative readings for 'in' and 'best' in the first
line. The transcriber by mistake inserted them in the second line. A
few lines above both Quartos give 'courage' for 'comrade,' a mistake
due undoubtedly to the eye and not to the ear.

We believe then that the defects of the manuscript from which the
Quarto of 1603 was printed had been in part at least supplemented by
a reference to the authentic copy in the library of the theatre. Very
probably the man employed for this purpose was some inferior actor or
servant, who would necessarily work in haste and by stealth, and in any
case would not be likely to work very conscientiously for the printer
or bookseller who was paying him to deceive his masters.

The Quarto of 1604, which we call Q₂, has the following title-page:

    _THE_ | Tragicall Historie of | HAMLET, | _Prince of Denmarke_.
    | By William Shakespeare. | Newly imprinted and enlarged to
    almost as much | againe as it was, according to the true and
    perfect | Coppie. | AT LONDON, | Printed by I. R. for N. L. and
    are to be sold at his | shoppe vnder Saint Dunstons Church in |
    Fleetstreet. 1604.

The printer 'I. R.' was no doubt, as Mr Collier says, James Roberts,
who had made an entry in the books of the Stationers' company as
early as July 26, 1602, of 'A booke, The Revenge of Hamlett prince
of Denmarke, as yt was latelie acted by the Lord Chamberleyn his
servantes.'

For some unknown reason the projected edition was delayed, and in the
mean time the popularity of the play encouraged N. L., i.e. Nicholas
Ling, and the other publisher, Trundell, to undertake a surreptitious
edition.

In the interval between the two editions Shakespeare seems to have
changed the names of some of his Dramatis Personæ, substituting
'Polonius' for 'Corambis' and 'Reynaldo' for 'Montano.' He may also
have changed the order of one or two scenes, and here and there erased
or inserted a few lines, but we think that no substantial change
was made, and that the chief differences between (Q₁) and Q₂ are
only such as might be expected between a bona fide, and a mala fide,
transcription.

The Quarto of 1605, which we call Q₃, is not, properly speaking, a new
edition, being printed from the same forms as Q₂, and differing from it
no more than one copy of the same edition may differ from another. The
title-page differs only in the date, where 1605 is substituted for 1604.

Another Quarto, our Q₄, printed in 1611, bears a title-page which does
not substantially differ from that of Q₃, except that it is said to be:

    'Printed for _Iohn Smethwicke_, and are to be sold at his
    shoppe | in Saint Dunstons Church-yeard in Fleetstreet. | Under
    the Diall. 1611. |'

Another Quarto, without date, is said on the title-page to be 'Newly
imprinted and inlarged, according to the true | and perfect Copy lastly
Printed,' and to be 'Printed by W. S. for _Iohn Smethwicke_.' Otherwise
the title-page is identical with that of Q₄. Mr Collier supposes this
undated Quarto to have been printed in 1607, because there is an entry
in the Stationers' books of that year and no edition with that date is
known to exist. We are convinced however that the undated Quarto was
printed from that of 1611, and we have therefore called it Q₅.

Another Quarto, printed 'by _R. Young_ for _John Smethwicke_,' was
published in 1637. This we call Q₆. It is printed from Q₅, though the
spelling is considerably modernized and the punctuation amended.

The symbol Qq signifies the agreement of Q₂, Q₃, Q₄, Q₅ and Q₆.

Besides these, several editions, usually known as Players' Quartos,
were printed at the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the
following century. Of these we have had before us during our collation,
editions of 1676, 1685, 1695 and 1703. These we call respectively
Q(1676), Q(1685), Q(1695) and Q(1703). We have given all readings
which seemed in any way remarkable, though we need scarcely say that
the changes made in these editions have no authority whatever. It is
however worthy of notice that many emendations usually attributed to
Rowe and Pope are really derived from one or other of these Players'
Quartos. When we give a reading as belonging to one of these Quartos,
it is to be understood that it occurs there for the first time and that
all the subsequent Quartos adopt it.

The text of Hamlet given in the Folio of 1623 is not derived from any
of the previously existing Quartos, but from an independent manuscript.
Many passages are found in the Folio which do not appear in any of the
Quartos. On the other hand many passages found in the Quartos are not
found in the Folio. It is to be remarked that several of those which
appear in the Folio and not in the Quarto of 1604 or its successors,
are found in an imperfect form in the Quarto of 1603, and therefore are
not subsequent additions. Both the Quarto text of 1604 and the Folio
text of 1623 seem to have been derived from manuscripts of the play
curtailed, and curtailed differently, for purposes of representation.
Therefore in giving in our text all the passages from both Folio and
Quarto we are reproducing, as near as may be, the work as it was
originally written by Shakespeare, or rather as finally retouched by
him after the spurious edition of 1603.

We have been unable to procure a copy of the Quarto edition of this
play, edited in 1703 by 'the accurate Mr John Hughs' (Theobald's
_Shakespeare Restored_, p. 26), and have therefore quoted the readings
of it on Theobald's authority. It is different from the Players'
Quarto of 1703, and is not mentioned in Bohn's edition of Lowndes's
_Bibliographer's Manual_. No copy of it exists in the British Museum,
the Bodleian, the library of the Duke of Devonshire, the Capell
collection, or any other to which we have had access.

We have to thank Dr C. M. Ingleby for the loan of several editions of
_Hamlet_ which we should otherwise have had difficulty in procuring.

2. KING LEAR first appeared in 1608. In this year there were two
editions in Quarto. One bears the following title:

    M. William Shakespeare, | _HIS_ | True Chronicle History of the
    life | and death of King _Lear_, and his | _three Daughters_. |
    _With the unfortunate life of_ EDGAR, | sonne and heire to the
    Earle of _Glocester_, and | _his sullen and assumed humour of_
    TOM | of Bedlam. | _As it was plaid before the Kings Maiesty
    at White-Hall, vp-_ | _on S. Stephens night, in Christmas
    Hollidaies_. | By his Maiesties Seruants, playing vsually at
    the | _Globe_ on the _Banck-side_. | Printed for _Nathaniel
    Butter_. | 1608. |

The printer's device is that of J. Roberts.

This we have called Q₁. In the few instances in which there are
differences between Capell's copy and that in the Duke of Devonshire's
library, we have distinguished the readings as those of Q₁ (Cap.) and
Q₁ (Dev.) respectively. Through the kindness of Sir S. Morton Peto and
Mr Lilly, we have been enabled to collate two other copies, but without
discovering any variations from that in the Capell collection.

In the same year another Quarto edition of this play was issued by the
same publisher. Its title is as follows:

    M. William Shak-speare: | _HIS_ | True Chronicle Historie of
    the life and | death of King LEAR and his three | Daughters.
    | _With the vnfortunate life of_ Edgar, _sonne_ | and heire
    to the Earle of Gloster, and his | sullen and assumed humor
    of | TOM of Bedlam: | _As it was played before the Kings
    Maiestie at Whitehall vpon_ | _S._ Stephans _night in Christmas
    Hollidayes_. | By his Maiesties seruants playing vsually at
    the Gloabe | on the Bancke-side. | _LONDON_,| Printed for
    _Nathaniel Butter_, and are to be sold at his shop in _Pauls_ |
    Church-yard at the signe of the Pide Bull neere | Sᵗ. _Austins_
    Gate. 1608. |

We have called this Q₂. In the six copies we have collated there are a
large number of very curious and important variations. To distinguish
them we have made use of the following notation.

1. Q₂ (Cap.) The copy in Capell's collection.

2. Q₂ (Dev.) The copy in the Library of the Duke of Devonshire.

3. Q₂ (Mus. per.) A perfect copy in the British Museum (C. 34. K. 18).

4. Q₂ (Mus. imp.) An imperfect copy (wanting title) in the British
Museum (C. 34. K. 17); formerly in the possession of Mr Halliwell.

5. Q₂ (Bodl. 1). A copy in the Bodleian Library (Malone 35), with the
title, but wanting the last leaf.

6. Q₂ (Bodl. 2). A copy in the Bodleian Library (Malone 37), wanting
title but having the last leaf.

It has been supposed in consequence of statements made by Malone and
Boswell that a third edition of King Lear was published in 1608.
We shall show that there is no evidence for this. In the _Variorum
Shakespeare_ (II. 652), edited by Boswell in 1821, three Quartos are
described, which are distinguished in the notes to the play by the
letters A, B, C, respectively. The first of these is a copy of Q₂,
quoted by us as Q₂ (Bodl. 1); the second is a copy of Q₁; and the
third, which is in reality another copy of Q₂ and is quoted by us as Q₂
(Bodl. 2), is described as follows:

"Title the same as the two former, except that like the first it begins
at signature B: and like the second, has no reference to the place of
sale."

This statement of Boswell's is taken from a note in Malone's
handwriting prefixed to the copy in question, which we transcribe.

"This copy of King Lear differs in some particulars from the two others
in Vol. IV.

"The title-page of it is the same as the second of those copies, that
is, it has no direction to the place of sale, and the first signat.
is B,--notwithstanding which there are minute diversities; thus, in
this copy in H₃ verso, we have 'A _foole_ vsurps my _bed_'; in the
other whose first signature is also B, we find--'My _foote_ usurps my
_body_', and in the copy without any direction to the place of sale
(whose first signature is A) 'My _foote_ usurps my _head_'."

Now it is a little remarkable that at present the copy has no
title-page at all, and there is no trace of the title-page having
been removed since the volume has been in its present condition. The
probability is that the title was originally wanting and that one had
been supplied from a copy of Q₁ before it came into Malone's hands, and
that while it was in this condition he wrote the above note upon it. It
was then sent to be bound in a volume with other quartos, and the title
may have been lost at the binder's, or may have been intentionally
removed as not belonging to the book. That alterations were made by the
binder is evident from the fact that the copy to which Malone refers as
the _second_ of those in Vol. IV. is in reality the _first_. Malone,
writing his note when Vol. IV. was arranged for binding, described
the then order of the plays, which must afterwards have been altered.
In any case, however Malone's statement is to be accounted for, it is
quite clear that Boswell must have described the Quarto after it was
bound, when the title could not have existed.

We have said that Boswell quotes the three Quartos of Lear, now in the
Bodleian, by the letters A, B, C, respectively. In doing so, however,
he is not consistent. We record his mistakes that others may not be
misled by them. Bearing in mind therefore that A = Q₂ (Bodl. 1), B =
Q₁, and C = Q₂ (Bodl. 2), we find in Act II. Scene 2 (Vol. X. p. 97)
'Quarto B, _ausrent_; Quarto A, reads _unreverent_.' Here B and A
should change places. In Act III. Scene 7 (p. 188), 'Quarto A omits
_roguish_:' for A read C. In Act IV. Scene 2 (p. 199), for 'Quartos B
and C, _the whistling_,' read 'Quarto C' alone. In Act IV. Scene 6 (p.
220) B and A should again be interchanged. In Act V. Scene 3 (p. 277),
'Quarto A omits this line'; for A read B. It will be seen from these
instances that A has been in turn made to represent three different
copies.

The differences in various copies of Q₂ are accounted for by supposing
that the corrections were made before the sheets were all worked
off, and that the corrected and uncorrected sheets were bound up
indiscriminately. It will be observed that the readings of the
uncorrected sheets of Q₂ agree for the most part with those of Q₁,
and this led us to the conclusion which had previously been arrived
at by Capell and also by J. P. Kemble, that the edition which we have
called Q₁ was the earlier of the two printed in the same year. But upon
collating a copy of Q₂ in the Bodleian, which we have called Q₂ (Bodl.
1), we found evidence which points to an opposite conclusion. In Kent's
soliloquy (II. 2. 160) that copy, as will be seen in our notes, reads,

          nothing almost sees _my rackles_
    But miserie, &c.

which of course is an accidental corruption, by displacement of the
type, of 'myrackles' (i.e. 'miracles') the true reading. In the
corrected copies of Q₂ this is altered, apparently by the printer's
conjecture, to 'my wracke', which is also the reading of Q₁. Throughout
the sheet in which this occurs the readings of Q₁ agree with the
corrected copies of Q₂, and had it not been for the instance quoted, we
might have supposed that the corrections in the latter were made from
Q₁. But the corruption 'my rackles' for 'miracles' must have come from
the original MS., and 'my wracke' is only a conjectural emendation, so
that the order of succession in this sheet at least appears to be the
following. First the uncorrected copy of Q₂, then the same corrected,
and lastly Q₁. On the other hand it is remarkable that Q₁, if printed
from Q₂ at all, must have been printed from a copy made up, with the
exception just mentioned from II. 1. 128 to II. 4. 133, and another
containing from IV. 6. 224 to V. 3. 64, of uncorrected sheets. Another
hypothesis which might be made is that Q₁ and Q₂ were printed from the
same manuscript, and that the printer of Q₁ corrupted 'miracles' into
'my wracke', while the printer of Q₂ made it 'my rackles', which was
afterwards altered by a reference to Q₁. The question, however, is
very difficult to decide, and at most is one rather of bibliographical
curiosity than of critical importance. We may mention that, without
giving the reasons for his conclusion, Jennens, in his edition of
_Lear_ in 1770, quotes as the 1st Quarto that which we have called Q₂
and vice versa.

A third Quarto, which we have called Q₃, was printed very carelessly
page for page from Q₁ and published in 1655.

In the first Folio _King Lear_ was printed from an independent
manuscript, and its text is on the whole much superior to that of the
Quartos. Each however supplies passages which are wanting in the other.

Capell appears to have prepared the play for press in the first
instance from Pope's first edition. The manuscript readings and stage
directions, marked in his copy of that edition but not adopted in his
own, we have quoted as 'Capell MS'.

3. OTHELLO was first printed in Quarto in 1622 with the following title:

    THE | Tragœdy of Othello, | The Moore of Venice. | _As it
    hath beene diuerse times acted at the_ | Globe, and at the
    Black-Friers, by | _his Maiesties Seruants_. | _Written by_
    William Shakespeare. | _LONDON_,| Printed by _N. O._ for
    _Thomas Walkley_, and are to be sold at his | shop, at the
    Eagle and Child, in Brittans Bursse. | 1622. |

To this edition which we call Q₁, the following preface was affixed by
the publisher:

                     The Stationer to the Reader.

    _To set forth a booke without an Epistle, were like to the old
    English prouerbe_, A blew coat without a badge, _& the Author
    being dead, I thought good to take that piece of worke vpon
    mee: To commend it, I will not, for that which is good, I hope
    euery man will commend, without intreaty: and I am the bolder,
    because the Authors name is sufficient to vent his worke. Thus
    leauing euery one to the liberty of iudgement: I haue ventered
    to print this Play, and leaue it to the generall censure._

                                                                _Yours_,

                                                         Thomas Walkley.

This first Quarto contains many oaths and expletives, which in all the
later editions are altered or omitted. This shows that the MS. from
which it was printed had not been recently used as an acting copy. Many
passages are omitted in Q₁, by accident or design, and some which we
find only in the later editions look like afterthoughts of the author.

The title-page of the second Quarto is letter for letter the same as
the first, except that it has the following imprint:

    _LONDON_,| Printed by _A. M._ for _Richard Hawkins_, and are to
    be sold at | his shoppe in Chancery-Lane, neere Sergeants-Inne.
    | 1630. |

Of this Quarto, which we term Q₂, Mr Collier says: 'It was
unquestionably printed from a manuscript different from that used for
the Quarto of 1622, or for the Folio of 1623.' But after a minute
comparison of the two it appears to us clear that the Quarto of 1630
must have been printed from a copy of the Quarto of 1622, which had
received additions and corrections in manuscript. The resemblances
between the two are too close to allow of any other supposition. These
additions and corrections, though agreeing for the most part with the
first Folio, which had appeared in the interval, were derived from an
independent source.

The third Quarto, which we refer to as Q₃, was printed from the second,
and is called 'The Fourth Edition.' It has the following imprint:

    _LONDON_, | Printed for _William Leak_ at the _Crown_ _in
    Fleet-_ | _street_, between the two Temple Gates, 1655 |

Jennens, in his edition of _Othello_, published in 1773, was not aware
of the existence of the Quarto of 1630, and quotes as the readings of
the second Quarto those of the edition of 1655.

An edition in Quarto, without date, is quoted by Capell on the
authority of Pope; but on reference to Pope's list it appears that,
though he has omitted the date, he refers to the Quarto of 1622, which
contains the publisher's preface.

The kindness of Sir S. Morton Peto has enabled us to consult a copy of
the first Quarto in the library at Chipstead, which, in cases where its
readings differ from those of the copies in the Capell and Devonshire
collections, we have distinguished as Q₁ (Chip.) A Players' Quarto of
1695, for the use of which, as well as for other acts of kindness, we
have to thank Sir Charles Bunbury, is quoted as Q (1695).

In the Addenda we have given some readings which we had not previously
seen from an anonymous tract published in 1752, with the title,
_Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmark_. The rest are chiefly from books which have been published
since the greater part of our volume was struck off.

SCENE I. _Elsinore. A platform before the castle._

           FRANCISCO _at his post. Enter to him_ BERNARDO.[1]

    _Ber._ Who's there?[2][3]

    _Fran._ Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.[3]

    _Ber._ Long live the king![3]

    _Fran._ Bernardo?[3][4]

    _Ber._ He.[3]                                                      5

    _Fran._ You come most carefully upon your hour.[5]

    _Ber._ 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.[6]

    _Fran._ For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.

    _Ber._ Have you had quiet guard?

    _Fran._                          Not a mouse stirring.            10

    _Ber._ Well, good night.[7]
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,[7][8]
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.[7][8]

    _Fran._ I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?[9]

                    _Enter_ HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS.

    _Hor._ Friends to this ground.

    _Mar._                         And liegemen to the Dane.          15

    _Fran._ Give you good night.[10]

    _Mar._                       O, farewell, honest soldier:[11][12]
    Who hath relieved you?[13]

    _Fran._                Bernardo hath my place.[13]
    Give you good night.                                [_Exit._[10][13]

    _Mar._               Holla! Bernardo!

    _Ber._                                Say,[14][15]
    What, is Horatio there?[14]

    _Hor._                  A piece of him.[16]

    _Ber._ Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.                 20

    _Mar._ What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?[17]

    _Ber._ I have seen nothing.

    _Mar._ Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,[18]
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:[19]                25
    Therefore I have entreated him along[20]
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,[20]
    That if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

    _Hor._ Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

    _Ber._                               Sit down awhile;[21]         30
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,[22]
    What we have two nights seen.[22][23]

    _Hor._                        Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

    _Ber._ Last night of all,                                         35
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole[24]
    Had made his course to illume that part of heaven[25]
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one,--[26]

                             _Enter_ Ghost.

    _Mar._ Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again![27]     40

    _Ber._ In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

    _Mar._ Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

    _Ber._ Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.[28]

    _Hor._ Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.[29]

    _Ber._ It would be spoke to.

    _Mar._                       Question it, Horatio.[30]            45

    _Hor._ What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,[31]
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak![32]

    _Mar._ It is offended.

    _Ber._                 See, it stalks away!                       50

    _Hor._ Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak![33]

                                                          [_Exit Ghost._

    _Mar._ 'Tis gone, and will not answer.

    _Ber._ How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?[34]                                          55

    _Hor._ Before my God, I might not this believe[35]
    Without the sensible and true avouch[36]
    Of mine own eyes.

    _Mar._            Is it not like the king?

    _Hor._ As thou art to thyself:
    Such was the very armour he had on[37]                            60
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;[38]
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.[39]
    'Tis strange.[40]

    _Mar._ Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,[41]         65
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.[42]

    _Hor._ In what particular thought to work I know not;[43]
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,[44]
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

    _Mar._ Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,[45]        70
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,[46]
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,[47]
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task                  75
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;[48]
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:[49]
    Who is't that can inform me?

    _Hor._                       That can I;
    At least the whisper goes so. Our last king,                      80
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,[50]
    Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--[51]
    For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--                85
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,[52]
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,[53]
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands[54]
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:[55]
    Against the which, a moiety competent                             90
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd[56]
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant[57]
    And carriage of the article design'd,[58]
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,[59]               95
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,[60]
    Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,[61][62]
    For food and diet, to some enterprise[62]
    That hath a stomach in't: which is no other--[63]                100
    As it doth well appear unto our state--[64]
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands[65]
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,                          105
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

    _Ber._ I think it be no other but e'en so:[66][67]
    Well may it sort, that this portentous figure[66]
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the king[66]              110
    That was and is the question of these wars.[66]

    _Hor._ A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.[66][68]
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,[66][69]
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,[66]
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead[66][70]        115
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:[66][71]
          .    .    .    .    .    .    .
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,[66][72][73]
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,[66][74][73]
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,[66]
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:[66]                    120
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,[66][75]
    As harbingers preceding still the fates[66][76]
    And prologue to the omen coming on,[66][77]
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated[66]
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.[66][78]                      125

                           _Re-enter_ Ghost.

    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion![79]
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me:[80]
    If there be any good thing to be done,[80]                       130
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,[81]
    Speak to me:[81]
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,[82][83]
    O, speak![82]                                                    135
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,[84]
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! [_The cock crows._] Stop it,
               Marcellus.[85]

    _Mar._ Shall I strike at it with my partisan?[86]                140

    _Hor._ Do, if it will not stand.[87][88]

    _Ber._                            'Tis here![87]

    _Hor._                                       'Tis here![87]

    _Mar._ 'Tis gone!                             [_Exit Ghost._[87][89]
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,[90]                         145
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.

    _Ber._ It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

    _Hor._ And then it started like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,[91]                   150
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day, and at his warning,[92]
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,[92]
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies[92][93]
    To his confine: and of the truth herein[92]                      155
    This present object made probation.

    _Mar._ It faded on the crowing of the cock.[94]
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes[95]
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:[96]                  160
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,[97]
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm,[98]
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.[99]

    _Hor._ So have I heard and do in part believe it.                165
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:[100]
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice,[101]
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,[102]                       170
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,[103]
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

    _Mar._ Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know[104]
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.      [_Exeunt._[105]  175


SCENE II. _A room of state in the castle._

     _Flourish. Enter the_ KING, QUEEN, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES,
          VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, _and_ Attendants.[106]

    _King._ Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death[107]
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted[107][108]
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom[109]
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature                      5
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,[110]
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,[111]
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--                         10
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,[112]
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone                       15
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.[113]
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,[114]
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,                        20
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,[115]
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,[116]
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.[117]                25
    Now for ourself, and for this time of meeting:[118]
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears[119]
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress                        30
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,[120]
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch[121]
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,[122]
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,[123]                  35
    Giving to you no further personal power[124]
    To business with the king more than the scope[124]
    Of these delated articles allow.[125]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.[126]

    _Cor._} In that and all things will we show our duty.[127]        40
    _Vol._}

    _King._ We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.[128]

                                      [_Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius._

    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?[129]
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,[130]         45
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?[131]
    The head is not more native to the heart,[132]
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.[133]
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

    _Laer._                           My dread lord,[134]             50
    Your leave and favour to return to France,
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France[135]              55
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

    _King._ Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?[136]

    _Pol._ He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave[137][138][139]
    By laboursome petition, and at last[138][139][140]
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:[139]                      60
    I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

    _King._ Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,[141]
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will![141][142]
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--[143]

    _Ham._ [_Aside_] A little more than kin, and less than kind.[144]  65

    _King._ How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

    _Ham._ Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.[145]

    _Queen_ Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,[146]
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids[147]                         70
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,[148]
    Passing through nature to eternity.

    _Ham._ Ay, madam, it is common.

    _Queen._                        If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?                             75

    _Ham._ Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,[149]
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,                            80
    Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,[150]
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,[151]
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    But I have that within which passes show;[152]                    85
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

    _King._ 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,[153]
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    But, you must know, your father lost a father,
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound[154]           90
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever[155]
    In obstinate condolement is a course[156]
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief:[156][157]
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,                         95
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,[158]
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    For what we know must be and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition                          100
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme[159]
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,[160]              105
    'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us[161]
    As of a father: for let the world take note,[162]
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love[163][164]                      110
    Than that which dearest father bears his son[164]
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent[164][165]
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,[166]
    It is most retrograde to our desire:[167]
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain[168]                      115
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin and our son.

    _Queen._ Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:[169]
    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.[170]

    _Ham._ I shall in all my best obey you, madam.[171]              120

    _King._ Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:[172]
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
    This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,[173]
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,                     125
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,[174]
    And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,[175]
    Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.[176]

                                     [_Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet._

    _Ham._ O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,[177]
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!                              130
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God![178]
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable[179]
    Seem to me all the uses of this world![180]
    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,[181]                  135
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this![182]
    But two months dead! nay, not so much, not two:
    So excellent a king; that was, to this,[183]
    Hyperion to a satyr: so loving to my mother,[183][184]           140
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven[185]
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth![186]
    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,[186][187]
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--[188]                145
    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--[189]
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old[190]
    With which she follow'd my poor father's body,[191]
    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she,--[192]
    O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,[193]             150
    Would have mourn'd longer,--married with my uncle,[194]
    My father's brother, but no more like my father[195]
    Than I to Hercules: within a month;
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears[196]
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,[197]                   155
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets![198]
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good:
    But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue![199]

              _Enter_ HORATIO, MARCELLUS, _and_ BERNARDO.

    _Hor._ Hail to your lordship!

    _Ham._                     I am glad to see you well:[200][201]  160
    Horatio,--or I do forget myself.[201][202]

    _Hor._ The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.[203]

    _Ham._ Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:[204]
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?[205]                                                  165

    _Mar._ My good lord?[206]

    _Ham._ I am very glad to see you. [_To Ber._] Good even, sir.[207]
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?[208]

    _Hor._ A truant disposition, good my lord.[209]

    _Ham._ I would not hear your enemy say so,[210]                  170
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence,[211]
    To make it truster of your own report[212]
    Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?[213]
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.[214]               175

    _Hor._ My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

    _Ham._ I prethee, do not mock me, fellow-student;[215]
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.[216]

    _Hor._ Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.[217]

    _Ham._ Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked-meats          180
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio![218]
    My father!--methinks I see my father.

    _Hor._ O where, my lord?

    _Ham._                   In my mind's eye, Horatio.[219]         185

    _Hor._ I saw him once; he was a goodly king.[220]

    _Ham._ He was a man, take him for all in all,[220][221]
    I shall not look upon his like again.[222]

    _Hor._ My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

    _Ham._ Saw? Who?[223]                                            190

    _Hor._ My lord, the king your father.

    _Ham._                                The king my father!

    _Hor._ Season your admiration for a while[224]
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver,[225]
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.

    _Ham._              For God's love, let me hear.[226]            195

    _Hor._ Two nights together had these gentlemen,
    Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
    In the dead vast and middle of the night,[227]
    Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,[228]                           200
    Appears before them, and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd[229]
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,[230]
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd[231]
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,[232]                       205
    Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did;[233]
    And I with them the third night kept the watch:
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,[234]
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,                 210
    The apparition comes: I knew your father;[235]
    These hands are not more like.

    _Ham._                         But where was this?

    _Mar._ My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

    _Ham._ Did you not speak to it?

    _Hor._                          My lord, I did,[236]
    But answer made it none: yet once methought[237]                 215
    It lifted up its head and did address[238]
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak:[239]
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.

    _Ham._                       'Tis very strange.                  220

    _Hor._ As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true,[240]
    And we did think it writ down in our duty[241]
    To let you know of it.[242]

    _Ham._ Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.[243]
    Hold you the watch to-night?

    _Mar._ }               We do, my lord.[244]                      225
    _Ber._ }

    _Ham._ Arm'd, say you?

    _Mar._ }              Arm'd, my lord.
    _Ber._ }

    _Ham._                                 From top to toe?[244]

    _Mar._ }  My lord, from head to foot.[244][245][246]
    _Ber._ }

    _Ham._ Then saw you not his face?[246][247]

    _Hor._ O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.[246][248]

    _Ham._ What, look'd he frowningly?[249]                          230

    _Hor._ A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

    _Ham._ Pale or red?

    _Hor._ Nay, very pale.

    _Ham._                 And fix'd his eyes upon you?

    _Hor._  Most constantly.

    _Ham._                   I would I had been there.

    _Hor._  It would have much amazed you.[250]                      235

    _Ham._  Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?[250][251]

    _Hor._  While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.[250][252]

    _Mar._}    Longer, longer.[250][253]
    _Ber._}

    _Hor._ Not when I saw't.

    _Ham._                   His beard was grizzled? no?[254][255]

    _Hor._  It was, as I have seen it in his life,[255][256]         240
    A sable silver'd.[257]

    _Ham._            I will watch to-night;
    Perchance 'twill walk again.

    _Hor._                       I warrant it will.[258]

    _Ham._  If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,                        245
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,[259]
    Let it be tenable in your silence still,[260]
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,[261]
    Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
    I will requite your loves. So fare you well:[262]                250
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve.[263]
    I'll visit you.

    _All._          Our duty to your honour.[264]

    _Ham._ Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.[265]

                                               [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._

    My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;[266]
    I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!               255
    Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,[267]
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.         [_Exit._


SCENE III. _A room in Polonius's house._

                  _Enter_ LAERTES _and_ OPHELIA.[268]

    _Laer._ My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:[269]
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,[270]
    But let me hear from you.

    _Oph._                    Do you doubt that?

    _Laer._ For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,[271]           5
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood,
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,[272]
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,[273]
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;[274]
    No more.

    _Oph._   No more but so?

    _Laer._                  Think it no more:[275]                   10
    For nature crescent does not grow alone[276]
    In thews and bulk; but, as this temple waxes,[277]
    The inward service of the mind and soul[278]
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch[279]                     15
    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,[280]
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;[281]
    For he himself is subject to his birth:[282]
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,[283]
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends[284]                 20
    The safety and health of this whole state,[285]
    And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,[286]
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it                          25
    As he in his particular act and place[287]
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,[288]
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,[289]                  30
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open[290]
    To his unmaster'd importunity.[291]
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,[292]
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.                             35
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
    The canker galls the infants of the spring[293]
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,[294]                   40
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

    _Oph._ I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,[295]          45
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,[296]
    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,[297]
    Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,[298]
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads[299]                50
    And recks not his own rede.[300]

    _Laer._                     O, fear me not.
    I stay too long: but here my father comes.

                         _Enter_ POLONIUS.[301]

    A double blessing is a double grace;[302]
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

    _Pol._ Yet here, Laertes! Aboard, aboard, for shame![303]         55
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee![304]
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,[305]
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.                           60
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,[306]
    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel,[307]
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment[308]
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware[309]               65
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't, that th' opposed may beware of thee.[310]
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice:[311]
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,                            70
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are of a most select and generous chief in that.[312]
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be:[313]                          75
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,[314]
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.[315]
    This above all: to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,[316]
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.                          80
    Farewell: my blessing season this in thee![317]

    _Laer._  Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.[318]

    _Pol._  The time invites you; go, your servants tend.[319]

    _Laer._  Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.

    _Oph._       'Tis in my memory lock'd,[320]                       85
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

    _Laer._  Farewell.                                     [_Exit._[321]

    _Pol._  What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?[322]

    _Oph._  So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.[323]

    _Pol._  Marry, well bethought:                                    90
    'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
    If it be so--as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution--I must tell you,                      95
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? give me up the truth.[324]

    _Oph._  He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.                                          100

    _Pol._  Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,[325]
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.[326]
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

    _Oph._  I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

    _Pol._  Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby,[327]       105
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,[328]
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;[329]
    Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.[330]

    _Oph._  My lord, he hath importuned me with love                 110
    In honourable fashion.

    _Pol._  Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.[331]

    _Oph._ And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,[332][333]
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.[332][334]

    _Pol._  Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,[335]         115
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul[336]
    Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,[337]
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,[338]
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,[339]
    You must not take for fire. From this time[340]                  120
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence;[341]
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate[342]
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,[343]
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk[344]                        125
    Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,[345]
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,[346]
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,[347]                  130
    The better to beguile. This is for all:[348]
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
    Have you so slander any moment leisure,[349]
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.[350]                    135

    _Oph._ I shall obey, my lord.                        [_Exeunt._[351]


SCENE IV. _The platform._[352]

               _Enter_ HAMLET, HORATIO, _and_ MARCELLUS.

    _Ham._ The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.[353]

    _Hor._ It is a nipping and an eager air.[354]

    _Ham._ What hour now?

    _Hor._                I think it lacks of twelve.

    _Mar._ No, it is struck.[355]

    _Hor._ Indeed? I heard it not: it then draws near the season[356]  5
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

           [_A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within._[357]

    What does this mean, my lord?[358]

    _Ham._  The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,[359]
    Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;[360]
    And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,[361]               10
    The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out[362]
    The triumph of his pledge.

    _Hor._                     Is it a custom?[363]

    _Ham._  Ay, marry, is't:[364]
    But to my mind, though I am native here[365]
    And to the manner born, it is a custom                            15
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west[366][367][368][369]
    Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:[366][367][369][370]
    They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase[366][367][371]
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes[366][367]                  20
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,[366][367]
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.[366][367]
    So, oft it chances in particular men,[366][367][372]
    That for some vicious mole of nature in them,[366][367][373]
    As, in their birth,--wherein they are not guilty,[366][367]       25
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,--[366][367]
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,[366][367][374]
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,[366][367]
    Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens[366][367]
    The form of plausive manners, that these men,--[366][367]         30
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,[366][367]
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--[366][367][375]
    Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,[366][367][376]
    As infinite as man may undergo--[366][367]
    Shall in the general censure take corruption[366][367]            35
    From that particular fault: the dram of eale[366][367][377][378]
    Doth all the noble substance of a doubt[367][377][378]
    To his own scandal.[367][377][379]

                             _Enter Ghost._

    _Hor._              Look, my lord, it comes![380]

    _Ham._ Angels and ministers of grace defend us![381]
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,                      40
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,[382]
    Thou comest in such a questionable shape[383]
    That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me![384]                      45
    Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell[385]
    Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,[385][386]
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,[387]
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,[388]
    Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,                          50
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    That thou, dead corse, again, in complete steel,
    Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,[389]
    Making night hideous; and we fools of nature[390]
    So horridly to shake our disposition[391]                         55
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?[392]
    Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?[393]

                                                [_Ghost beckons Hamlet._

    _Hor._  It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.

    _Mar._        Look, with what courteous action                    60
    It waves you to a more removed ground:[394]
    But do not go with it.

    _Hor._                 No, by no means.[395]

    _Ham._  It will not speak; then I will follow it.[396]

    _Hor._  Do not, my lord.

    _Ham._                   Why, what should be the fear?[397]
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;[398]                         65
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?[399]
    It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.

    _Hor._  What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,[400]
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff[401]                       70
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,[402]
    And there assume some other horrible form,[403]
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason[404]
    And draw you into madness? think of it:[405]
    The very place puts toys of desperation,[406]                     75
    Without more motive, into every brain[406]
    That looks so many fathoms to the sea[406]
    And hears it roar beneath.[406][407][408]

    _Ham._                     It waves me still.[407]
    Go on; I'll follow thee.

    _Mar._ You shall not go, my lord.

    _Ham._                            Hold off your hands.[409]       80

    _Hor._ Be ruled; you shall not go.

    _Ham._                             My fate cries out,[410]
    And makes each petty artery in this body[411]
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.[412]
    Still am I call'd: unhand me, gentlemen;[413]
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me:                 85
    I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.

                                        [_Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet._[414]

    _Hor._  He waxes desperate with imagination.[415]

    _Mar._  Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

    _Hor._  Have after. To what issue will this come?

    _Mar._  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.              90

    _Hor._  Heaven will direct it.

    _Mar._                  Nay, let's follow him.       [_Exeunt._[416]


SCENE V. _Another part of the platform._

                    _Enter_ Ghost _and_ HAMLET.[417]

    _Ham._  Whither wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.[418]

    _Ghost._  Mark me.

    _Ham._             I will.

    _Ghost._                  My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames[419]
    Must render up myself.

    _Ham._                 Alas, poor ghost!

    _Ghost._ Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing[420][421]       5
    To what I shall unfold.[420]

    _Ham._                  Speak; I am bound to hear.[422]

    _Ghost._ So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.[423]

    _Ham._ What?[424]

    _Ghost._ I am thy father's spirit;
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,                      10
    And for the day confined to fast in fires,[425]
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid[426]
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word                         15
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part[427]
    And each particular hair to stand an end,[428]
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:[429]                     20
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list![430]
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love--[431]

    _Ham._ O God![432]

    _Ghost._ Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.              25

    _Ham._ Murder![433]

    _Ghost._ Murder most foul, as in the best it is,[434]
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.

    _Ham._ Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift[435]
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,[436]                       30
    May sweep to my revenge.[437]

    _Ghost._                 I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed[438][439]
    That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,[440]
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:[440]
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,[441]                 35
    A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark[442]
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,[443]
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life[444]
    Now wears his crown.

    _Ham._               O my prophetic soul![445]                    40
    My uncle![445][446]

    _Ghost._ Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,[447]
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--[448]
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power[449]
    So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust[450]                      45
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:[451]
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there![452]
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage; and to decline[453]                    50
    Upon a wretch, whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine![454][455]
    But virtue, as it never will be moved,[454]
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,[456]                   55
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed[457][458]
    And prey on garbage.[457][459]
    But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;[460]
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,[461]
    My custom always of the afternoon,[462]                           60
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,[463]
    With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,[464]
    And in the porches of my ears did pour[465]
    The leperous distilment; whose effect[466]
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man[466]                       65
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body;[467]
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset[468]
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,[469]
    The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;                     70
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,[470]
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:[471]             75
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,[472]
    Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd;[473]
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head:[474]
    O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible![475]                     80
    If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,[476]
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive[477]                85
    Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,[478]
    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:                           90
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! remember me.                      [_Exit._[479]

    _Ham._  O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
    And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;[480]
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee![481][482]                  95
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat[483]
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee![482]
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,[484]           100
    That youth and observation copied there;
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven![485]
    O most pernicious woman![486]                                    105
    0 villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables,--meet it is I set it down,[487][488]

    _Mar._                               Lord Hamlet!

    _Hor._                                       Heaven secure him![494]

    _Hor._}               Ay, by heaven, my lord.
    _Mar._}

    _Ham._ There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark[503][504]

    _Hor._ There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave[506]   125
    To tell us this.[506][507]

    _Ham._           Why, right; you are i' the right;
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
    You, as your business and desire shall point you;[508]
    For every man hath business and desire,[509]                     130
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,[510]
    Look you, I'll go pray.[511]

    _Hor._ These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.[512]

    _Ham._ I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;[513]

    _Hor._                There's no offence, my lord.               135

    _Ham._ Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,[515]
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,[516]
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,[517]             140
    As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.

    _Hor._ What is't, my lord? we will.[518]

    My lord, not I.[520]

    _Mar._          Nor I, my lord, in faith.

    _Ham._ Upon my sword.

    _Mar._                We have sworn, my lord, already.[521]

    _Ham._ Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.[522]

    _Ghost._ [_Beneath_] Swear.[523]

    _Ham._ Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
        true-penny?[524][525]                                        150
    Come on: you hear this fellow in the cellarage:[524][526]
    Consent to swear.

    _Hor._            Propose the oath, my lord.[527]

    _Ham._ Never to speak of this that you have seen,[528]
    Swear by my sword.

    _Ghost._ [_Beneath_] Swear.[529]                                 155

    _Ham._  Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.[530]
    Come hither, gentlemen,[531]
    And lay your hands again upon my sword:[531]
    Never to speak of this that you have heard,[531][532]
    Swear by my sword.[531]                                          160

    _Ghost._ [_Beneath_] Swear.[529][533]

    _Ham._ Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?[534]
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.[535]

    _Hor._ O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

    _Ham._ And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.[536]         165
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.[537][538]
    But come;[538][539]
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,[539][540]
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,[541][542][543]          170
    As I perchance hereafter shall think meet[541][542][544][545]
    To put an antic disposition on,[541][542][544]
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,[542][546]
    With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,[542][547]
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,[542][548]             175
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'[542][549][550]
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'[542][550][551]
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note[542][552]
    That you know aught of me: this not to do,[553]
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,[553]              180
    Swear.[553]

    _Ghost._ [_Beneath_] Swear.[529]

    _Ham._  Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!  [_They swear._] So,
              gentlemen,[554]
    With all my love I do commend me to you:[555]
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is                              185
    May do, to express his love and friending to you,[556]
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;[557]
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.[558]
    The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
    That ever I was born to set it right![559]                       190
    Nay, come, let's go together.                             [_Exeunt._

ACT II.


SCENE I. _A room in Polonius's house._

                 _Enter_ POLONIUS _and_ REYNALDO.[560]

    _Pol._  Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.[561][562]

    _Rey._  I will, my lord.

    _Pol._  You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,[562][563]
    Before you visit him, to make inquire[564]
    Of his behaviour.

    _Rey._            My lord, I did intend it.                        5

    _Pol._  Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,[565]
    Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,[566]
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense, and finding[567]
    By this encompassment and drift of question                       10
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer[568]
    Than your particular demands will touch it:[568]
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him,
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,[569]
    And in part him:' do you mark this, Reynaldo?[562]                15

    _Rey._ Ay, very well, my lord.

    _Pol._ 'And in part him; but,' you may say, 'not well:
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild,[570]
    Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank                    20
    As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.

    _Rey._                As gaming, my lord.

    _Pol._ Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,[571][572]  25
    Drabbing: you may go so far.[571]

    _Rey._ My lord, that would dishonour him.

    _Pol._ Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.[573]
    You must not put another scandal on him,[574]
    That he is open to incontinency;[575]                             30
    That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,[576][577]
    Of general assault.[576]

    _Rey._              But, my good lord,--[578]                     35

    _Pol._ Wherefore should you do this?

    _Rey._                               Ay, my lord,[579][580]
    I would know that.[579]

    _Pol._             Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:[581]
    You laying these slight sullies on my son,[582]
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,[583]            40
    Mark you,[584][585]
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,[584][586]
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes[587]
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured[588]
    He closes with you in this consequence;[589]                      45
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'[590]
    According to the phrase or the addition[591]
    Of man and country.

    _Rey._              Very good, my lord.

    _Pol._ And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I[592][593]
    about to say? By the mass, I was about to say something:[592][594]  50
    where did I leave?[592]

    _Rey._ At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'[595]
    and 'gentleman.'[595]

    _Pol._ At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;[596]
    He closes with you thus: 'I know the gentleman;[597]              55
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,[598]
    Or then, or then, with such, or such, and, as you say,[599]
    There was a' gaming, there o'ertook in's rouse,[600]
    There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,[601]
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'[602]                      60
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.[603]
    See you now;[603]
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:[604]
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,[605]                     65
    By indirections find directions out:[606]
    So, by my former lecture and advice,[607]
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

    _Rey._ My lord, I have.

    _Pol._                  God be wi' ye; fare ye well.[608]

    _Rey._ Good my lord![609]                                         70

    _Pol._ Observe his inclination in yourself.[610]

    _Rey._ I shall, my lord.

    _Pol._ And let him ply his music.

    _Rey._                            Well, my lord.

    _Pol._ Farewell!                                   [_Exit Reynaldo._

                         _Enter_ OPHELIA.[611]

                          How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?

    _Oph._  O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted![612]      75

    _Pol._  With what, i' the name of God?[613]

    _Oph._  My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,[614]
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,[615]
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,[616]
    Ungarter'd and down-gyved to his ancle;[617]                      80
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors, he comes before me.[618]

    _Pol._  Mad for thy love?

    _Oph._                    My lord, I do not know,[619]            85
    But truly I do fear it.[619]

    _Pol._                  What said he?

    _Oph._  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;[620]
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face                               90
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;[621]
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,[622]
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He raised a sigh so piteous and profound[623]
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk[624]                       95
    And end his being: that done, he lets me go:[625]
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd,[626]
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
    For out o' doors he went without their helps,[627]
    And to the last bended their light on me.                        100

    _Pol._ Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.[628]
    This is the very ecstasy of love;
    Whose violent property fordoes itself[629]
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven[630]                          105
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?

    _Oph._ No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.

    _Pol._            That hath made him mad.                        110
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgement[631]
    I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle[632]
    And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy![633]
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age[634]
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions                         115
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:[635]
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move[636]
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.[637]
    Come.                                           [_Exeunt._[638]  120


SCENE II. _A room in the castle._

       _Flourish. Enter_ KING, QUEEN, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN,
                         _and_ Attendants.[639]

    _King._ Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern![640][641]
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard[642]
    Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,[643]                       5
    Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man[644]
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,[645]                       10
    That, being of so young days brought up with him
    And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,[646]
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time: so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather                        15
    So much as from occasion you may glean,[647]
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus,[648]
    That open'd lies within our remedy.[649]

    _Queen._ Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living[650]                   20
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will[651]
    As to expend your time with us awhile[652]
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks[653]                    25
    As fits a king's remembrance.

    _Ros._                        Both your majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,[654]
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.

    _Guil._           But we both obey,[655]
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent                      30
    To lay our service freely at your feet,[656]
    To be commanded.[657]

    _King._ Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.[640][641]

    _Queen._ Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:[640][641]
    And I beseech you instantly to visit                              35
    My too much changed son. Go, some of you,[658]
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.[659]

    _Guil._ Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!

    _Queen._                     Ay, amen!

          [_Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants._[660]

                           _Enter_ POLONIUS.

    _Pol._ The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,                 40
    Are joyfully return'd.

    _King._ Thou still hast been the father of good news.

    _Pol._ Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,[661]
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king:[662]                      45
    And I do think, or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure[663]
    As it hath used to do, that I have found[664]
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

    _King._ O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.[665]            50

    _Pol._ Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.[666]

    _King._ Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

                                                  [_Exit Polonius._[667]

    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found[668]
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.                  55

    _Queen._ I doubt it is no other but the main;
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.[669]

    _King._ Well, we shall sift him.

         _Re-enter_ POLONIUS, _with_ VOLTIMAND _and_ CORNELIUS.

                                          Welcome, my good friends![670]
    Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?[671]

    _Volt._ Most fair return of greetings and desires.                60
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies, which to him appear'd[672]
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,[673]
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your highness: whereat grieved,                    65
    That so his sickness, age and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
    Makes vow before his uncle never more                             70
    To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee[674]
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack:[673]                     75
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,      [_Giving a paper._[675]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,[676]
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.[677]

    _King._                  It likes us well,                        80
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,[678]
    Answer, and think upon this business.[679]
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:[680]
    Most welcome home!                [_Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius._

    _Pol._             This business is well ended.[681]              85
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
    Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit[682]                  90
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,[683]
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad:
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,[684]
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?[685]
    But let that go.

    _Queen._         More matter, with less art.                      95

    _Pol._ Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity,[686]
    And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;[687]
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.[688]
    Mad let us grant him then: and now remains                       100
    That we find out the cause of this effect,[689]
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause:
    Thus it remains and the remainder thus.[690][691]
    Perpend.[690][692]                                               105
    I have a daughter,--have while she is mine,--[693]
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this: now gather and surmise.           [_Reads._[694]
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
              Ophelia,'--[695]
    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile[696]  110
    phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:                [_Reads._[697][698]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these,' &c.[697][699]

    _Queen._ Came this from Hamlet to her?

    _Pol._ Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.   [_Reads._[700]
        'Doubt thou the stars are fire;                              115
          Doubt that the sun doth move;
        Doubt truth to be a liar;
          But never doubt I love.
    'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not
    art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most       120
    best, believe it. Adieu.
          'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this
                  machine is to him, HAMLET.'[701]
    This in obedience hath my daughter shown me;[702]
    And more above, hath his solicitings,[703]                       125
    As they fell out by time, by means and place,
    All given to mine ear.

    _King._                But how hath she[704]
    Received his love?[704]

    _Pol._             What do you think of me?

    _King._ As of a man faithful and honourable.

    _Pol._ I would fain prove so. But what might you think,[705]     130
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing,--[706]
    As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me,--what might you,
    Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,[707]
    If I had play'd the desk or table-book,[708]                     135
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,[709]
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
    What might you think? No, I went round to work,
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:[710]
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;[711]                  140
    This must not be:' and then I prescripts gave her,[712]
    That she should lock herself from his resort,[713]
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;[714]
    And he repulsed, a short tale to make,[714][715]                 145
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,[716]
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,[717][718]
    Thence to a lightness, and by this declension[718][719]
    Into the madness wherein now he raves[720]
    And all we mourn for.[721]                                       150

    _King._ Do you think this?

    _Queen._                   It may be, very like.[722]

    _Pol._  Hath there been such a time, I'ld fain know that,[723]
    That I have positively said ''tis so,'
    When it proved otherwise?

    _King._                   Not that I know.

    _Pol._ [_Pointing to his head and shoulder_] Take this
              from this, if this be otherwise:[724]                  155
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.

    _King._            How may we try it further?[725]

    _Pol._ You know, sometimes he walks four hours together[726][727]
    Here in the lobby.[726]

    _Queen._           So he does, indeed.[728]                      160

    _Pol._ At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
    Be you and I behind an arras then;[729][730]
    Mark the encounter: if he love her not,[729]
    And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
    Let me be no assistant for a state,                              165
    But keep a farm and carters.[731]

    _King._                      We will try it.

    _Queen._ But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.[732]

    _Pol._ Away, I do beseech you, both away:[733]
    I'll board him presently.

                                  [_Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants._

                    _Enter_ HAMLET, _reading_.[734]

    O, give me leave: how does my good Lord Hamlet?[735]             170

    _Ham._ Well, God-a-mercy.

    _Pol._ Do you know me, my lord?

    _Ham._ Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.[736]

    _Pol._ Not I, my lord.

    _Ham._ Then I would you were so honest a man.                    175

    _Pol._ Honest, my lord![737]

    _Ham._ Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to[738]
    be one man picked out of ten thousand.[738][739]

    _Pol._ That's very true, my lord.

    _Ham._ For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog,[740]          180
    being a god kissing carrion--Have you a daughter?[741]

    _Pol._ I have, my lord.

    _Ham._ Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
    blessing; but as your daughter may conceive,--friend, look[742]
    to't.                                                            185

    _Pol._ [_Aside_] How say you by that? Still harping on[743]
    my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a[743][744][745]
    fishmonger: he is far gone: and truly in my youth I[743][745][746][747]
    suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I'll[743][746][748]
    speak to him again. What do you read, my lord?[743][746][749]    190

    _Ham._ Words, words, words.

    _Pol._ What is the matter, my lord?[749]

    _Ham._ Between who?[750]

    _Pol._ I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.[751]

    _Ham._ Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that[752]  195
    old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled,
    their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum, and[753]
    that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most[754]
    weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and
    potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus      200
    set down; for yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if like a[755]
    crab you could go backward.

    _Pol._ [_Aside_] Though this be madness, yet there is[756][757][758]
    method in't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?[757]

    _Ham._ Into my grave.[759]                                       205

    _Pol._ Indeed, that's out of the air. [_Aside_] How pregnant[760][761]
    sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness[760][762]
    hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously[760][763][764]
    be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive[760][764][765][766]
    the means of meeting between him and my daughter. My[760][766][767]  210
    honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.[760][767]

    _Ham._ You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I[768]
    will more willingly part withal: except my life, except my[769][770]
    life, except my life.[770]

    _Pol._ Fare you well, my lord.                                   215

    _Ham._ These tedious old fools!

              _Enter_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN.[771]

    _Pol._ You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.[772]

    _Ros._ [_To Polonius_] God save you, sir!        [_Exit Polonius._[773]

    _Guil._ My honoured lord![774]

    _Ros._ My most dear lord!                                        220

    _Ham._ My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?[775]
    Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do you both?[776]

    _Ros._ As the indifferent children of the earth.

    _Guil._ Happy, in that we are not over-happy;[777]
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.[777][778]           225

    _Ham._ Nor the soles of her shoe?[779]

    _Ros._ Neither, my lord.

    _Ham._ Then you live about her waist, or in the middle[780]
    of her favours?[781]

    _Guil._ Faith, her privates we.[782]                             230

    _Ham._ In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true;
    she is a strumpet. What's the news?[783]

    _Ros._ None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.[784]

    _Ham._ Then is doomsday near: but your news is not[785]
    true. Let me question more in particular: what have you,[786]    235
    my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she[786]
    sends you to prison hither?[786]

    _Guil._ Prison, my lord![786]

    _Ham._  Denmark's a prison.[786]

    _Ros._  Then is the world one.[786]                              240

    _Ham._ A goodly one; in which there are many confines,[786]
    wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.[786][787]

    _Ros._  We think not so, my lord.[786]

    _Ham._ Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing[786][788]
    either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a[786][788]  245
    prison.[786]

    _Ros._ Why, then your ambition makes it one; 'tis too[786]
    narrow for your mind.[786]

    _Ham._  O God, I could be bounded in a nut-shell and[786]
    count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I[786]   250
    have bad dreams.[786][789]

    _Guil._ Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very[786]
    substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.[786]

    _Ham._  A dream itself is but a shadow.[786]

    _Ros._  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a[786]   255
    quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.[786]

    _Ham._ Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs[786]
    and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to[786]
    the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.[786][790]

    _Ros. Guil._  We'll wait upon you.[786][791]                     260

    _Ham._ No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest[786]
    of my servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I[786]
    am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of[786]
    friendship, what make you at Elsinore?[792][793]

    _Ros._  To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.                265

    _Ham._ Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but[794]
    I thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear
    a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own[795]
    inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me:[796]
    come, come; nay, speak.                                          270

    _Guil._  What should we say, my lord?

    _Ham._ Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were[797]
    sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks,[798]
    which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I
    know the good king and queen have sent for you.                  275

    _Ros._  To what end, my lord?

    _Ham._ That you must teach me. But let me conjure you,
    by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our[799]
    youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by[800]
    what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be[801]  280
    even and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no.[802]

    _Ros._ [_Aside to Guil._] What say you?[803]

    _Ham._ [_Aside_] Nay then, I have an eye of you.--If you[804][805]
    love me, hold not off.[804]

    _Guil._  My lord, we were sent for.                              285

    _Ham._ I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent
    your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen[806][807]
    moult no feather. I have of late--but wherefore I know not--lost[807][808]
    all my mirth, foregone all custom of exercises; and indeed[809]
    it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly[810]     290
    frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most
    excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging[811]
    firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why,[812]
    it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent[813]
    congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man![814]     295
    how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and[815][816]
    moving how express and admirable! in action how like an[816]
    angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the[816]
    world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this
    quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman[817]    300
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.[818]

    _Ros._ My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

    _Ham._ Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man[819]
    delights not me'?

    _Ros._ To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what        305
    lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you:[820]
    we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to[821]
    offer you service.

    _Ham._ He that plays the king shall be welcome; his
    majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight[822]    310
    shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis;[823]
    the humourous man shall end his part in peace; the clown[824]
    shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o' the sere,[824][825]
    and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse[826]
    shall halt for't. What players are they?                         315

    _Ros._  Even those you were wont to take such delight[827]
    in, the tragedians of the city.[828]

    _Ham._  How chances it they travel? their residence,[829]
    both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.[830]

    _Ros._ I think their inhibition comes by the means of the[831][832]  320
    late innovation.[831][833]

    _Ham._ Do they hold the same estimation they did when[834]
    I was in the city? are they so followed?

    _Ros._  No, indeed, are they not.[835]

    _Ham._  How comes it? do they grow rusty?[836]                   325

    _Ros._ Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace:[836]
    but there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry[836][837]
    out on the top of question and are most tyranically clapped[836][838]
    for't: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common[836][839]
    stages--so they call them--that many wearing rapiers[836][840]   330
    are afraid of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither.[836]

    _Ham._ What, are they children? who maintains 'em?[836][841]
    how are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no[836]
    longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if[836]
    they should grow themselves to common players,--as it is[836][842]  335
    most like, if their means are no better,--their writers do them[836][843]
    wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession?[836][844]

    _Ros._  Faith, there has been much to do on both sides,[836]
    and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy:[836]
    there was for a while no money bid for argument unless[836]      340
    the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.[836]

    _Ham._ Is't possible?[836]

    _Guil._ O, there has been much throwing about of brains.[836]

    _Ham._ Do the boys carry it away?[836]

    _Ros._ Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.[836][845]  345

    _Ham._ It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of[846]
    Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while[847]
    my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats[848]
    a-piece, for his picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something[849]
    in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.[850]  350

                                         [_Flourish of trumpets within._

    _Guil._ There are the players.[851]

    _Ham._ Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your[793]
    hands, come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion[852]
    and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest[853][854]
    my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show[854][855]  355
    fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment[856]
    than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and
    aunt-mother are deceived.

    _Guil._ In what, my dear lord?

    _Ham._ I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind              360
    is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.[857]

                           _Enter_ POLONIUS.

    _Pol._ Well be with you, gentlemen![858]

    _Ham._ Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each[859]
    ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out[860]
    of his swaddling clouts.[861]                                    365

    _Ros._ Happily he's the second time come to them; for[862]
    they say an old man is twice a child.

    _Ham._ I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the[863]
    players; mark it. You say right, sir: o'Monday morning;[864]
    'twas so, indeed.[865]                                           370

    _Pol._ My lord, I have news to tell you.

    _Ham._ My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius[866]
    was an actor in Rome,--[867]

    _Pol._ The actors are come hither, my lord.

    _Ham._ Buz, buz!                                                 375

    _Pol._ Upon my honour,--[868]

    _Ham._ Then came each actor on his ass,--[869]

    _Pol._ The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
    comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,[870]
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral,[870][871]  380
    scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too[872]
    heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the[873][874][875]
    liberty these are the only men.[873][875]

    _Ham._  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure[876][877]
    hadst thou!                                                      385

    _Pol._  What a treasure had he, my lord?[878]

    _Ham._  Why,[879]
    'One fair daughter, and no more,[879]
      The which he loved passing well.'[879]

    _Pol._ [_Aside_] Still on my daughter.[880]                      390

    _Ham._  Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?

    _Pol._  If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter[881][882]
    that I love passing well.[881]

    _Ham._  Nay, that follows not.[881]

    _Pol._  What follows, then, my lord?                             395

    _Ham._  Why,[883]
                      'As by lot, God wot,'[883]
    and then, you know,[884]
                'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--[884]
    the first row of the pious chanson will show you more;[885]      400
    for look, where my abridgement comes.[886]

                     _Enter four or five_ Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad to see[887]
    thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Why[888][889]
    thy face is valanced since I saw thee last; comest thou to[889][890]
    beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress!           405
    By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than[891]
    when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray[892]
    God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not
    cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome.
    We'll e'en to 't like French falconers, fly at any thing we[893]  410
    see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste of
    your quality; come, a passionate speech.

    _First Play._ What speech, my good lord?[894][895]

    _Ham._ I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
    never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,  415
    pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general:[896]
    but it was--as I received it, and others, whose judgements[897]
    in such matters cried in the top of mine--an excellent play,
    well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty
    as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets in[898]   420
    the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the
    phrase that might indict the author of affection; but called[899]
    it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very[900]
    much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly[900][901]
    loved: 'twas Æneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially,[902]  425
    where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in[903]
    your memory, begin at this line; let me see, let me see;
          'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,'--[904]
    It is not so: it begins with 'Pyrrhus.'[905]
          'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,                  430
          Black as his purpose, did the night resemble[906]
          When he lay couched in the ominous horse,[907]
          Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd[908]
          With heraldry more dismal: head to foot[909]
          Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd[910]               435
          With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
          Baked and impasted with the parching streets,[911]
          That lend a tyrannous and a damned light[912][913]
          To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,[913][914]
          And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,[915]              440
          With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus[916]
          Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
    So, proceed you.[917]

    _Pol_ 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent
    and good discretion.                                             445

    _First Play._        'Anon he finds him[894]
    Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,[918]
    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,[919]
    Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,[920]
    Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;                   450
    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
    The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,[921]
    Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top[922]
    Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash[923]
    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,[924]            455
    Which was declining on the milky head
    Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:[925]
    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood.[926]
    And like a neutral to his will and matter,[927][928]
    Did nothing.[928]                                                460
    But as we often see, against some storm,
    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,[929]
    The bold winds speechless and the orb below[930]
    As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
    Doth rend the region, so after Pyrrhus' pause[924][931]          465
    Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;[932]
    And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall[933]
    On Mars's armour, forged for proof eterne,[934]
    With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword[924]
    Now falls on Priam.                                              470
    Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,[935]
    In general synod take away her power,
    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,[936]
    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
    As low as to the fiends!'                                        475

    _Pol._ This is too long.[937]

    _Ham._ It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,[938]
    say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps:
    say on: come to Hecuba.

    _First Play._ 'But who, O, who had seen the mobled
              queen--'[939][940][941]                                480

    _Ham._ 'The mobled queen?'[940][942]

    _Pol._ That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.[943]

    _First Play._ 'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames[944]
    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head[945]
    Where late the diadem stood; and for a robe,                     485
    About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
    A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up:[946]
    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
    'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced:[947]
    But if the gods themselves did see her then,                     490
    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
    In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,[948]
    The instant burst of clamour that she made,
    Unless things mortal move them not at all,[949]
    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven[950]            495
    And passion in the gods.'[951]

    _Pol._  Look, whether he has not turned his colour and[952]
    has tears in's eyes. Prithee, no more.[953]

    _Ham._ 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest of this[954]
    soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed?[955]  500
    Do you hear, let them be well used, for they are the abstract[956]
    and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were
    better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.[957]

    _Pol._  My lord, I will use them according to their desert.[958]

    _Ham._  God's bodykins, man, much better: use every[959]         505
    man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping? Use[958][960]
    them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve,
    the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.

    _Pol._  Come, sirs.

    _Ham._ Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.         510

               [_Exit Polonius with all the Players but the First._[961]

    Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of[962]
    Gonzago?[963]

    _First Play._ Ay, my lord.

    _Ham._ We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a[961][964][965]
    need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which[965][966]  515
    I would set down and insert in't, could you not?[967]

    _First Play._ Ay, my lord.

    _Ham._ Very well. Follow that lord; and look you[961]
    mock him not. [_Exit First Player._] My good friends, I'll[968]
    leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore.[969]          520

    _Ros._ Good my lord![970]

    _Ham._ Ay, so, God be wi' ye! [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and
            Guildenstern._] Now I am alone.[971]
    O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,[972]                    525
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit[973]
    That from her working all his visage wann'd;[974]
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,[975]
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting[976]
    With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing![977]             530
    For Hecuba![978]
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,[979]
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion[980]
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears                 535
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,[981]
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.[982][983]
    Yet I,[982][984][985]                                            540
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,[984][985][986]
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,[985][987]
    And can say nothing; no, not for a king,[985]
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?[988]                    545
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?[988]
    Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?[988]
    Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,[988]
    As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?[988]
    Ha![989]                                                         550
    'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be[990]
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this[991]
    I should have fatted all the region kites[992]
    With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain![993]             555
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain![994]
    O, vengeance![995]
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,[996]
    That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,[997]
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,                       560
    Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
    And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,[998][999]
    A scullion![998][999]
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard[998][1000]
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,[998][1001]             565
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently[1002]
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players[1003]        570
    Play something like the murder of my father
    Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,[1004]
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen[1005]
    May be the devil; and the devil hath power[1006]                 575
    To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing                    580
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.              [_Exit._

ACT III.


SCENE I. _A room in the castle._

       _Enter_ KING, QUEEN, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, _and_
                          GUILDENSTERN.[1007]

    _King._ And can you, by no drift of circumstance,[1008]
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,[1009]
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

    _Ros._ He does confess he feels himself distracted,                5
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.[1010]

    _Guil._ Nor do we find him forward to be sounded;[1011]
    But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,[1011]
    When we would bring him on to some confession[1011]
    Of his true state.[1011]

    _Queen._           Did he receive you well?[1011][1012]           10

    _Ros._ Most like a gentleman.

    _Guil._ But with much forcing of his disposition.

    _Ros._ Niggard of question, but of our demands[1013]
    Most free in his reply.[1013]

    _Queen._                Did you assay him[1014][1015]
    To any pastime?[1014][1016]                                       15

    _Ros._ Madam, it so fell out that certain players[1017]
    We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,[1018]
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it: they are about the court,[1019]
    And, as I think, they have already order                          20
    This night to play before him.

    _Pol._                         'Tis most true:
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
    To hear and see the matter.

    _King._ With all my heart; and it doth much content me[1020]
    To hear him so inclined.[1020]                                    25
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,[1020]
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.[1020][1021]

    _Ros._ We shall, my lord.

                                 [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._

    _King._                   Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;[1022]
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,[1023]
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here[1024][1025]              30
    Affront Ophelia:[1024][1026]
    Her father and myself, lawful espials,[1026][1027]
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,[1028]
    We may of their encounter frankly judge,[1029]
    And gather by him, as he is behaved,                              35
    If't be the affliction of his love or no[1030]
    That thus he suffers for.

    _Queen._                  I shall obey you:
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish[1031]
    That your good beauties be the happy cause[1032]
    Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues[1032][1033]    40
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,[1034]
    To both your honours.

    _Oph._                Madam, I wish it may.           [_Exit Queen._

    _Pol._ Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,[1035]
    We will bestow ourselves. [_To Ophelia_] Read on this book;[1036]
    That show of such an exercise may colour                          45
    Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--[1037]
    'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er[1038]
    The devil himself.

    _King._ [_Aside_] O, 'tis too true![1039]
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!             50
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word:
    O heavy burthen!

    _Pol._ I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.[1040]          55

                                            [_Exeunt King and Polonius._

                         _Enter_ HAMLET.[1041]

    _Ham._ To be, or not to be: that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,[1042]
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,[1043]
    And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;[1044][1045]           60
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end[1045][1046]
    The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation[1047]
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;[1048]
    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;                65
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,[1049]
    Must give us pause: there's the respect[1050]
    That makes calamity of so long life;[1050]
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,[1051]            70
    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,[1052]
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,[1053]
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make[1054]                      75
    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,[1055]
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,[1056]
    But that the dread of something after death,
    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn[1057]
    No traveller returns, puzzles the will,[1058]                     80
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,[1059]
    And thus the native hue of resolution[1060]
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,[1061]             85
    And enterprises of great pitch and moment[1062]
    With this regard their currents turn awry[1063]
    And lose the name of action. Soft you now![1064]
    The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons[1065]
    Be all my sins remember'd.

    _Oph._                     Good my lord,[1066]                    90
    How does your honour for this many a day?

    _Ham._ I humbly thank you: well, well, well.[1067]

    _Oph._ My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
    That I have longed long to re-deliver;[1068]
    I pray you, now receive them.

    _Ham._                        No, not I;[1069][1070]              95
    I never gave you aught.[1070]

    _Oph._ My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;[1071]
    And with them words of so sweet breath composed
    As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,[1072]
    Take these again; for to the noble mind                          100
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.

    _Ham._ Ha, ha! are you honest?

    _Oph._ My lord?[1073]

    _Ham._ Are you fair?                                             105

    _Oph._ What means your lordship?

    _Ham._ That if you be honest and fair, your honesty[1074][1075]
    should admit no discourse to your beauty.[1075]

    _Oph._ Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce[1076]
    than with honesty?[1077]                                         110

    _Ham._ Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
    transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force
    of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this was[1078]
    sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I[1079]
    did love you once.                                               115

    _Oph._ Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

    _Ham._ You should not have believed me; for virtue
    cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it:[1080]
    I loved you not.[1081]

    _Oph._ I was the more deceived.                                  120

    _Ham._ Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a[1082]
    breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet
    I could accuse me of such things that it were better my
    mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful,
    ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have[1083]       125
    thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape,[1084]
    or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do
    crawling between heaven and earth? We are arrant knaves[1085]
    all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.[1086]
    Where's your father?                                             130

    _Oph._ At home, my lord.

    _Ham._ Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may[1087]
    play the fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.[1087][1088]

    _Oph._ O, help him, you sweet heavens!

    _Ham._ If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for[1089]  135
    thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou
    shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell.[1090]
    Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise
    men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
    To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.[1091]               140

    _Oph._ O heavenly powers, restore him![1092]

    _Ham._ I have heard of your paintings too, well enough;[1093]
    God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves[1094]
    another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nick-name[1095]
    God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance.[1096][1097]  145
    Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad.[1097][1098]
    I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married[1099]
    already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as[1100]
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                           [_Exit._[1101]

    _Oph._ O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown![1102]            150
    The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword:[1103]
    The expectancy and rose of the fair state,[1104]
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,[1105]                 155
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,[1106]
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,[1107]
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;[1108]
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth[1109]
    Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,                              160
    To have seen what I have seen, see what I see![1110]

                    _Re-enter_ KING _and_ POLONIUS.

    _King._ Love! his affections do not that way tend;[1111]
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,[1112]
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul[1113]
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood,                         165
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger: which for to prevent,[1114]
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down:--he shall with speed to England,[1115]
    For the demand of our neglected tribute:                         170
    Haply the seas and countries different
    With variable objects shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,[1116]
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus[1117][1118]
    From fashion of himself. What think you on 't?[1117]             175

    _Pol._ It shall do well: but yet do I believe[1119][1120]
    The origin and commencement of his grief[1119][1121]
    Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia![1122]
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
    We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;[1123]                180
    But, if you hold it fit, after the play,
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief: let her be round with him;[1124]
    And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear[1125]
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,                    185
    To England send him, or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.

    _King._                       It shall be so:
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.        [_Exeunt._[1126]


SCENE II. _A hall in the castle._

                  _Enter_ HAMLET _and_ Players.[1127]

    _Ham._ Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced[1128]
    it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as[1129]
    many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke[1130]
    my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your[1131]
    hand, thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest,  5
    and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you[1132]
    must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it
    smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious[1133]
    periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very[1134]
    rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, for the most[1135]  10
    part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows
    and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing[1136]
    Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

    _First Play._ I warrant your honour.[1137]

    _Ham._ Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion       15
    be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word[1138]
    to the action; with this special observance, that you o'er-step[1139]
    not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone[1140]
    is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first[1141]
    and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to         20
    nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own[1142]
    image, and the very age and body of the time his form and[1143]
    pressure. Now this overdone or come tardy off, though[1144][1145]
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious[1145]
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance[1146]  25
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be[1147]
    players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and[1148]
    that highly, not to speak it profanely, that neither having[1149]
    the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan,[1150]
    nor man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought[1150][1151]  30
    some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made[1152]
    them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

    _First Play._ I hope we have reformed that indifferently[1137]
    with us, sir.[1153]

    _Ham._ O, reform it altogether. And let those that play           35
    your clowns speak no more than is set down for them: for
    there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some[1154]
    quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the[1155]
    mean time some necessary question of the play be then to
    be considered: that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition  40
    in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

                                                      [_Exeunt Players._

        _Enter_ POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, _and_ GUILDENSTERN.[1156]

    How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?[1157]

    _Pol._ And the queen too, and that presently.[1158]

    _Ham._ Bid the players make haste.           [_Exit Polonius._[1159]
    Will you two help to hasten them?                                 45

    _Ros. Guil._ We will, my lord.

                           [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._[1160]

    _Ham._ What ho! Horatio!

                         _Enter_ HORATIO.[1161]

    _Hor._ Here, sweet lord, at your service.[1162]

    _Ham._ Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation coped withal.[1163]                       50

    _Hor._ O, my dear lord,--[1164]

    _Ham._                    Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,[1165]
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?[1166]
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,[1167]                55
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee[1168]
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?[1169]
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,[1170]
    And could of men distinguish, her election[1171]
    Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been[1171]            60
    As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that fortune's buffets and rewards[1172]
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those[1173]
    Whose blood and judgement are so well commingled[1174]
    That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger                     65
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man[1175]
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,[1176]
    As I do thee. Something too much of this.
    There is a play to-night before the king;                         70
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance
    Which I have told thee of my father's death:[1177]
    I prithee, when thou seest that act a-foot,[1178]
    Even with the very comment of thy soul[1179]
    Observe my uncle: if his occulted guilt[1180]                     75
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,[1181]
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;[1182]
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,[1183]                     80
    And after we will both our judgements join[1184]
    In censure of his seeming.[1185]

    _Hor._                     Well, my lord:
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,[1186]
    And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.[1187]

    _Ham._ They are coming to the play: I must be idle:[1188]         85
    Get you a place.

    _Danish march. A flourish. Enter_ KING, QUEEN, POLONIUS,
        OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, _and other Lords
        attendant, with the Guard carrying torches_.[1189]

    _King._ How fares our cousin Hamlet?[1190]

    _Ham._ Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat[1191][1192]
    the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.[1191]

    _King._ I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these[1191]      90
    words are not mine.[1191]

    _Ham._ No, nor mine now. [_To Polonius_] My lord, you[1191][1193]
    played once i' the university, you say?[1191][1194]

    _Pol._ That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good[1195]
    actor.                                                            95

    _Ham._ What did you enact?[1196]

    _Pol._ I did enact Julius Cæsar: I was killed i' the Capitol;[1197]
    Brutus killed me.

    _Ham._ It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a
    calf there. Be the players ready?                                100

    _Ros._ Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.[1198]

    _Queen._ Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.[1199]

    _Ham._ No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.[1200]

    _Pol._ [_To the King_] O, ho! do you mark that?[1201]

    _Ham._ Lady, shall I lie in your lap?[1202]                      105

                                        [_Lying down at Ophelia's feet._

    _Oph._ No, my lord.

    _Ham._ I mean, my head upon your lap?[1203][1204]

    _Oph._ Ay, my lord.[1203]

    _Ham._ Do you think I meant country matters?[1205]

    _Oph._ I think nothing, my lord.                                 110

    _Ham._ That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.[1206]

    _Oph._ What is, my lord?

    _Ham._ Nothing.

    _Oph._ You are merry, my lord.[1207]

    _Ham._ Who, I?                                                   115

    _Oph._ Ay, my lord.

    _Ham._ O God, your only jig-maker. What should a[1208]
    man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
    mother looks, and my father died within 's two hours.[1209]

    _Oph._ Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.[1210]                120

    _Ham._ So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for[1211][1212]
    I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago,[1212][1213]
    and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's
    memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by'r lady, he[1214][1215]
    must build churches then; or else shall he suffer not thinking[1215]  125
    on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is, 'For, O,
    for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot.'[1216]

                 _Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters._

    _Enter a_ King _and a_ Queen _very lovingly; the Queen
        embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of
        protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his
        head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers:
        she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,
        takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the_
        King's _ears, and exit. The_ Queen _returns; finds the_
        King _dead, and makes passionate action. The_ Poisoner,
        _with some two or three_ Mutes, _comes in again, seeming
        to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The_
        Poisoner _wooes the_ Queen _with gifts: she seems loath and
        unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love_.[1217]

                                                              [_Exeunt._

    _Oph._ What means this, my lord?[1218]

    _Ham._ Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.       130

    _Oph._ Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                        _Enter_ Prologue.[1219]

    _Ham._ We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot[1220]
    keep counsel; they'll tell all.[1221]

    _Oph._ Will he tell us what this show meant?[1222]

    _Ham._ Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you[1223]    135
    ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.

    _Oph._ You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the[1224]
    play.

    _Pro._ For us, and for our tragedy,
    Here stooping to your clemency,                                  140
    We beg your hearing patiently.

    _Ham._ Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?[1225]

    _Oph._ 'Tis brief, my lord.

    _Ham._ As woman's love.

              _Enter two_ Players, King _and_ Queen.[1226]

    _P. King._ Full thirty times hath Phœbus' cart gone
            round[1227][1228][1229]                                  145
    Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,[1228][1230]
    And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen[1231]
    About the world have times twelve thirties been,[1232]
    Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
    Unite commutual in most sacred bands.[1233]                      150

    _P. Queen._ So many journeys may the sun and moon[1234]
    Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
    But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
    So far from cheer and from your former state,[1235]
    That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,                     155
    Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:[1236]
    For women's fear and love holds quantity,[1236][1237]
    In neither aught, or in extremity.[1238]
    Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know,[1239]
    And as my love is sized, my fear is so:[1240]                    160
    Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear,[1241][1242]
    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.[1241]

    _P. King._ Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
    My operant powers their functions leave to do:[1243]
    And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,[1244]             165
    Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind[1245]
    For husband shalt thou--[1246]

    _P. Queen._              O, confound the rest!
    Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
    In second husband let me be accurst!
    None wed the second but who kill'd the first.[1247]              170

    _Ham._ [_Aside_] Wormwood, wormwood.[1248]

    _P. Queen._ The instances that second marriage move[1249]
    Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:[1250]
    A second time I kill my husband dead,[1251]
    When second husband kisses me in bed.                            175

    _P. King._ I do believe you think what now you speak,[1252]
    But what we do determine oft we break.
    Purpose is but the slave to memory,
    Of violent birth but poor validity:[1253]
    Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,[1254]          180
    But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
    Most necessary 'tis that we forget
    To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
    What to ourselves in passion we propose,
    The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.                       185
    The violence of either grief or joy[1255]
    Their own enactures with themselves destroy:[1256]
    Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
    Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.[1257]
    This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange[1258]            190
    That even our loves should with our fortunes change,
    For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
    Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love.[1259]
    The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;[1260]
    The poor advanced makes friends of enemies:                      195
    And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;[1261]
    For who not needs shall never lack a friend,[1262]
    And who in want a hollow friend doth try
    Directly seasons him his enemy.[1263]
    But, orderly to end where I begun,                               200
    Our wills and fates do so contrary run,
    That our devices still are overthrown,
    Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
    So think thou wilt no second husband wed,[1264]
    But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.[1265]          205

    _P. Queen._ Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light![1266]
    Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
    To desperation turn my trust and hope![1267]
    An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope![1267][1268]
    Each opposite, that blanks the face of joy,                      210
    Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
    Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
    If, once a widow, ever I be wife![1269]

    _Ham._ If she should break it now![1270]

    _P. King._ 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;[1271]  215
    My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
    The tedious day with sleep.                         [_Sleeps._[1272]

    _P. Queen._                 Sleep rock thy brain;
    And never come mischance between us twain!            [_Exit._[1273]

    _Ham._ Madam, how like you this play?[1274]

    _Queen._ The lady doth protest too much, methinks.[1275]         220

    _Ham._ O, but she'll keep her word.

    _King._ Have you heard the argument? Is there no
    offence in't?

    _Ham._ No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
    i' the world.[1276]                                              225

    _King._ What do you call the play?

    _Ham._ The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically.[1277]
    This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago[1278]
    is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see[1279]
    anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o' that? your[1280]  230
    majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let[1281]
    the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.[1282]

                        _Enter_ LUCIANUS.[1283]

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.[1284]

    _Oph._ You are as good as a chorus, my lord.[1285]

    _Ham._ I could interpret between you and your love, if           235
    I could see the puppets dallying.

    _Oph._ You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

    _Ham._ It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.[1286]

    _Oph._ Still better, and worse.[1287]

    _Ham._ So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;[1288][1289]  240
    pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:[1289][1290]
    the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.[1291]

    _Luc._ Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;[1292]
    Confederate season, else no creature seeing;[1293]
    Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,                  245
    With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,[1294]
    Thy natural magic and dire property,[1295]
    On wholesome life usurp immediately.

                       [_Pours the poison into the sleeper's ear._[1296]

    _Ham._ He poisons him i' the garden for his estate. His[1297]
    name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and written in very[1298]   250
    choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer gets
    the love of Gonzago's wife.

    _Oph._ The king rises.

    _Ham._ What, frighted with false fire![1299]

    _Queen._ How fares my lord?                                      255

    _Pol._ Give o'er the play.

    _King._ Give me some light. Away!

    _Pol._ Lights, lights, lights!

                             [_Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio._[1300]

    _Ham._ Why, let the stricken deer go weep,[1301]
    The hart ungalled play;[1302]                                    260
    For some must watch, while some must sleep:[1303]
      Thus runs the world away.[1304]

    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers--if the rest of
    my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two Provincial roses[1305]
    on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players,[1306]  265
    sir?[1307]

    _Hor._ Half a share.

    _Ham._ A whole one, I.[1308]
    For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
      This realm dismantled was[1309]                                270
    Of Jove himself; and now reigns here[1309]
      A very, very--pajock.[1310]

    _Hor._ You might have rhymed.

    _Ham._ O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
    thousand pound. Didst perceive?[1311]                            275

    _Hor._ Very well, my lord.

    _Ham._ Upon the talk of the poisoning?[1312]

    _Hor._ I did very well note him.[1313]

    _Ham._ Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!            280
            For if the king like not the comedy,[1314]
            Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

            _Re-enter_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN.[1315]

    _Guil._ Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.[1316]

    _Ham._ Sir, a whole history.                                     285

    _Guil._ The king, sir,--[1317]

    _Ham._ Ay, sir, what of him?[1318]

    _Guil._ Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.

    _Ham._ With drink, sir?

    _Guil._ No, my lord, rather with choler.[1319]                   290

    _Ham._ Your wisdom should show itself more richer to[1320]
    signify this to the doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation[1321]
    would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.[1322]

    _Guil._ Good my lord, put your discourse into some[1323]
    frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.[1323][1324]       295

    _Ham._ I am tame, sir: pronounce.

    _Guil._ The queen, your mother, in most great affliction
    of spirit, hath sent me to you.

    _Ham._ You are welcome.[1325]

    _Guil._ Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the           300
    right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome
    answer, I will do your mother's commandment: if not, your
    pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.[1326]

    _Ham._ Sir, I cannot.

    _Guil._ What, my lord?[1327]                                     305

    _Ham._ Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased:[1328]
    but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;[1329]
    or rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no[1330]
    more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--[1331]

    _Ros._ Then thus she says; your behaviour hath struck[1332]      310
    her into amazement and admiration.

    _Ham._ O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother![1333]
    But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?[1334]
    Impart.[1335]

    _Ros._ She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere          315
    you go to bed.

    _Ham._ We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
    Have you any further trade with us?

    _Ros._ My lord, you once did love me.

    _Ham._ So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.[1336]       320

    _Ros._ Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?
    you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty, if you[1337]
    deny your griefs to your friend.

    _Ham._ Sir, I lack advancement.

    _Ros._ How can that be, when you have the voice of the           325
    king himself for your succession in Denmark?

    _Ham._ Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows,'--the proverb[1338]
    is something musty.

               _Re-enter_ Players _with recorders_.[1339]

    O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with you:--[1340]
    why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you         330
    would drive me into a toil?

    _Guil._  O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is[1341]
    too unmannerly.[1341]

    _Ham._ I do not well understand that. Will you play
    upon this pipe?                                                  335

    _Guil._  My lord, I cannot.[1342]

    _Ham._  I pray you.

    _Guil._  Believe me, I cannot.

    _Ham._  I do beseech you.[1343]

    _Guil._  I know no touch of it, my lord.[1344]                   340

    _Ham._ It is as easy as lying: govern these ventages[1345]
    with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your[1346]
    mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look[1347]
    you, these are the stops.

    _Guil._  But these cannot I command to any utterance             345
    of harmony; I have not the skill.

    _Ham._ Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you
    make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem[1348]
    to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
    mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the[1349]     350
    top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent[1349]
    voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak.[1350]
    'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a[1351]
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can[1352]
    fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.[1352][1353]                355

                        _Enter_ POLONIUS.[1354]

    God bless you, sir![1355]

    _Pol._ My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
    presently.

    _Ham._ Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape[1356][1357]
    of a camel?[1357][1358][1359]                                    360

    _Pol._ By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.[1360][1359]

    _Pol._ It is backed like a weasel.[1361][1362]

    _Ham._ Or like a whale?[1363]

    _Pol._ Very like a whale.                                        365

    _Ham._ Then I will come to my mother by and by.[1364]
    They fool me to the top of my bent. I will come by and[1365][1366]

    _Pol._ I will say so.                  [_Exit Polonius._[1366][1367]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,

SCENE III. _A room in the castle._

          _Enter_ KING, ROSENCRANTZ, _and_ GUILDENSTERN.[1379]

    _King._  I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;[1380]
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you:
    The terms of our estate may not endure[1381]                       5
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow[1382]
    Out of his lunacies.

    _Guil._              We will ourselves provide:[1383]
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe[1384][1385]
    That live and feed upon your majesty.[1384]                       10

    _Ros._ The single and peculiar life is bound[1386]
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more[1387]
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests[1388]
    The lives of many. The cease of majesty[1389]                     15
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,[1390]
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,[1391]
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things[1392]
    Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,[1393]            20
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone[1394]
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.[1395]

    _King._ Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,[1396]
    For we will fetters put about this fear,[1397]                    25
    Which now goes too free-footed.

                           _Enter_ POLONIUS.

    _Pol._  My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
    To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:[1399]
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,                         30
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:[1400]
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
    And tell you what I know.

    _King._                   Thanks, dear my lord.[1401]             35

    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,[1402]
    A brother's murder. Pray can I not,[1403][1404]
    Though inclination be as sharp as will:[1404][1405]
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,[1406]                 40
    And like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand[1407]
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens                     45
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;[1408]                  50
    My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer[1409]
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder?'[1410]
    That cannot be, since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murder,[1411]
    My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.                         55
    May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?[1412]
    In the corrupted currents of this world[1413]
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,[1414]
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself[1415]
    Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;                          60
    There is no shuffling, there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd[1416]
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
    To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
    Try what repentance can: what can it not?                         65
    Yet what can it when one can not repent?[1417]
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that struggling to be free
    Art more engaged! Help, angels! make assay![1418]
    Bow, stubborn knees, and, heart with strings of steel,[1419]      70
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                        [_Retires and kneels._[1420]

                            _Enter_ HAMLET.

    _Ham._ Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;[1421]
    And now I'll do't: and so he goes to heaven:[1422]
    And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:[1423]                75
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send[1424]
    To heaven.[1425]
    O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.[1426]
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,[1427]                   80
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;[1428]
    And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,[1429]
    To take him in the purging of his soul,                           85
    When he is fit and season'd for his passage?[1430]
    No.[1431]
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:[1432]
    When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,[1433]
    Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;[1434]                   90
    At game, a-swearing, or about some act[1435]
    That has no relish of salvation in 't;
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven[1436]
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:                        95
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.                   [_Exit._

    _King._ [_Rising_] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:[1437]
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.                  [_Exit._


SCENE IV. _The Queen's closet._

                  _Enter_ QUEEN _and_ POLONIUS.[1438]

    _Pol._ He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:[1439]
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,[1440]
    And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between[1441]
    Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.[1442]
    Pray you, be round with him.

    _Ham._                   [_Within_] Mother, mother, mother![1443]  5

    _Queen._ I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw, I[1444][1445][1446]
    hear him coming.[1445]

                                     [_Polonius hides behind the arras._

                         _Enter_ HAMLET.[1447]

    _Ham._ Now, mother, what's the matter?

    _Queen._ Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

    _Ham._ Mother, you have my father much offended.                  10

    _Queen._ Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

    _Ham._ Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.[1448]

    _Queen._ Why, how now, Hamlet!

    _Ham._                         What's the matter now?[1449]

    _Queen._ Have you forgot me?

    _Ham._                       No, by the rood, not so:
    You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;                 15
    And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.[1450]

    _Queen._ Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.[1451]

    _Ham._ Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;[1452]
    You go not till I set you up a glass[1453][1454]
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.[1454][1455]             20

    _Queen._ What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
    Help, help, ho![1456][1457]

    _Pol._ [_Behind_] What, ho! help, help, help![1457][1458]

    _Ham._ [_Drawing_] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead![1457]

    _Queen._                         O me, what hast thou done?[1460]  25

    _Ham._ Nay, I know not: is it the king?[1461]

    _Queen._ O, what a rash and bloody deed is this![1462]

    _Ham._ A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

    _Queen._ As kill a king!

    _Ham._                   Ay, lady, 'twas my word.[1463]           30

                           [_Lifts up the arras and discovers Polonius._

    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell![1464]
    I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;[1465]
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
    And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,                      35
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not brass'd it so,[1466]
    That it be proof and bulwark against sense.[1467]

    _Queen._  What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?

    _Ham._                        Such an act                         40
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
    Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose[1468]
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows[1469]
    As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed                         45
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;[1470][1471]
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,[1471][1472]
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,[1473]
    Is thought-sick at the act.                                       50

    _Queen._                    Ay me, what act,[1474][1475]
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?[1475]

    _Ham._ Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;[1476]                   55
    Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;[1477]
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;[1478]
    A combination and a form indeed,[1479]                            60
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man:
    This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
    Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,[1480]
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?[1481]              65
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?[1482]
    You cannot call it love, for at your age
    The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,[1483]
    And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement                  70
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,[1484][1485]
    Else could you not have motion: but sure that sense[1485][1486]
    Is apoplex'd: for madness would not err,[1485]
    Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd[1485]
    But it reserved some quantity of choice,[1485]                    75
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't[1485]
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?[1487]
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,[1488]
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,[1488]
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense[1488]                      80
    Could not so mope.[1488][1489]
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,[1489][1490]
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,[1491]
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame                       85
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,[1492]
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.[1493]

    _Queen._                 O Hamlet, speak no more:
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,[1494]
    And there I see such black and grained spots[1495]                90
    As will not leave their tinct.[1496]

    _Ham._                         Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,[1497]
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty,--

    _Queen._              O, speak to me no more;[1498]
    These words like daggers enter in my ears;[1499]                  95
    No more, sweet Hamlet!

    _Ham._                 A murderer and a villain;
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe[1500]
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,[1501]
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole                      100
    And put it in his pocket!

    _Queen._                  No more![1502]

    _Ham._ A king of shreds and patches--

                          _Enter_ Ghost.[1503]

    Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,[1504]
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?[1505]

    _Queen._ Alas, he's mad![1506]                                   105

    _Ham._ Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by[1507]
    The important acting of your dread command?
    O, say![1508]

    _Ghost._ Do not forget: this visitation                          110
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits:
    O, step between her and her fighting soul:[1509]
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
    Speak to her, Hamlet.

    _Ham._                How is it with you, lady?                  115

    _Queen._ Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy[1510]
    And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?[1511]
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,                      120
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,[1512]
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,[1513]
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?

    _Ham._ On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares![1514]       125
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,[1515]
    Would make them capable. Do not look upon me,[1516]
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects: then what I have to do[1517]
    Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.                130

    _Queen._ To whom do you speak this?

    _Ham._                              Do you see nothing there?[1518]

    _Queen._ Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.[1519]

    _Ham._ Nor did you nothing hear?

    _Queen._                         No, nothing but ourselves.

    _Ham._ Why, look you there! look, how it steals away![1520]
    My father, in his habit as he lived![1521]                       135
    Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal![1522]

                                                          [_Exit Ghost._

    _Queen._ This is the very coinage of your brain:
    This bodiless creation ecstasy[1523]
    Is very cunning in.[1523]

    _Ham._              Ecstasy![1524]
    My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,                  140
    And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
    That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,[1525]
    And I the matter will re-word, which madness[1526]
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,[1527]
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,[1528]              145
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks:
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,[1529]
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past, avoid what is to come,[1530]                 150
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds,[1531]
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,[1532][1533][1534]
    For in the fatness of these pursy times[1533][1535]
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,[1533]
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.[1533][1536]          155

    _Queen._ O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.[1537]

    _Ham._ O, throw away the worser part of it,[1538]
    And live the purer with the other half.[1539]
    Good night: but go not to my uncle's bed;[1540]
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.                             160
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,[1541][1542]
    Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,[1541][1542]
    That to the use of actions fair and good[1541]
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,[1541]
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,[1541][1543]              165
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;[1544]
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,[1544][1545]
    And either ... the devil, or throw him out[1544][1546]
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:[1544]              170
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,

    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind:[1550]
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.[1550][1551]
    One word more, good lady.[1552]

    _Queen._                  What shall I do?                       180

    _Ham._ Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;[1553]
    Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,                185
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,[1554]
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,[1555]                   190
    Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?[1556]
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep[1557]                    195
    And break your own neck down.

    _Queen._ Be thou assured, if words be made of breath
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe[1558]
    What thou hast said to me.

    _Ham._ I must to England; you know that?

    _Queen._                                      Alack,[1559][1560]  200
    I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.[1560][1561]

    _Ham._ There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,[1562]
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,[1562]
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,[1562]
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;[1562][1563]              205
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer[1562][1564]
    Hoist with his own petar: and't shall go hard[1562][1565]
    But I will delve one yard below their mines,[1562]
    And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet[1562]
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.[1562][1566]           210
    This man shall set me packing:[1567]
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
    Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor[1568]
    Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish prating knave.[1569]                   215
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _A room in the castle._

      _Enter_ KING, QUEEN, ROSENCRANTZ, _and_ GUILDENSTERN.[1571]

    _King._  There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:[1572]
    You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?

    _Queen._ Bestow this place on us a little while.

                           [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._[1573]

    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night![1574]                5

    _King._  What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?[1575]

    _Queen._  Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend[1576]
    Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,[1577]
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'a rat, a rat!'[1578]                 10
    And in this brainish apprehension kills[1579]
    The unseen good old man.

    _King._                  O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there:[1580]
    His liberty is full of threats to all,
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.                             15
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?[1581]
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,[1582]
    This mad young man: but so much was our love,
    We would not understand what was most fit,                        20
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed[1583]
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?

    _Queen._  To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore[1584]                   25
    Among a mineral of metals base,[1585]
    Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.[1586]

    _King._ O Gertrude, come away![1587]
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
    But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed[1588]              30
    We must, with all our majesty and skill,
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

            _Re-enter_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN.[1589]

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid:[1590]
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:[1591]           35
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.

                           [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._[1592]

    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
    And let them know, both what we mean to do,[1593]
    And what's untimely done....[1594]                                40
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter[1594]
    As level as the cannon to his blank[1594]
    Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name[1594][1595]
    And hit the woundless air. O, come away![1594]
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.                [_Exeunt._  45


SCENE II. _Another room in the castle._

                         _Enter_ HAMLET.[1596]

    _Ham._ Safely stowed.

    _Ros._ } [_Within_] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet![1597]
    _Guil._}

    _Ham._ But soft, what noise? who calls on Hamlet?[1598]
    O, here they come.

             _Enter_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN.[1599]

    _Ros._ What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?            5

    _Ham._ Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.[1600]

    _Ros._ Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.

    _Ham._ Do not believe it.

    _Ros._ Believe what?                                              10

    _Ham._ That I can keep your counsel and not mine
    own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what replication[1601]
    should be made by the son of a king?

    _Ros._ Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

    _Ham._ Ay, sir; that soaks up the king's countenance,             15
    his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king
    best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the[1602]
    corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed:
    when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing
    you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.                         20

    _Ros._ I understand you not, my lord.

    _Ham._ I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
    foolish ear.

    _Ros._ My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and
    go with us to the king.                                           25

    _Ham._ The body is with the king, but the king is not[1603]
    with the body. The king is a thing--[1604]

    _Guil._ A thing, my lord?[1605]

    _Ham._ Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and[1606][1607]
    all after.                                      [_Exeunt._[1607]  30


SCENE III. _Another room in the castle._

                    _Enter_ KING, _attended_.[1608]

    _King._  I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.[1609]
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him:[1610]
    He's loved of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes;                   5
    And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,[1611]
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,[1612]
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are relieved,                              10
    Or not at all.

                       _Enter_ ROSENCRANTZ.[1613]

                   How now! what hath befall'n?

    _Ros._ Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.

    _King._                 But where is he?

    _Ros._ Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

    _King._ Bring him before us.                                      15

    _Ros._ Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.

                _Enter_ HAMLET _and_ GUILDENSTERN.[1614]

    _King._ Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

    _Ham._ At supper.

    _King._ At supper! where?

    _Ham._ Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a[1615]          20
    certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your[1616]
    worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures
    else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat[1617]
    king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two[1618]
    dishes, but to one table: that's the end.[1619]                   25

    _King._ Alas, alas![1620]

    _Ham._ A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of[1620]
    a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.[1620][1621]

    _King._ What dost thou mean by this?

    _Ham._ Nothing but to show you how a king may go a                30
    progress through the guts of a beggar.[1622]

    _King._ Where is Polonius?

    _Ham._ In heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger
    find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself.
    But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you[1623]      35
    shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.

    _King._ Go seek him there.              [_To some Attendants._[1624]

    _Ham._ He will stay till you come.       [_Exeunt Attendants._[1625]

    _King._ Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,[1626]
    Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve                           40
    For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;[1627]
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,[1628]
    The associates tend, and every thing is bent[1629]
    For England.

    _Ham._       For England?

    _King._                   Ay, Hamlet.

    _Ham._                                Good.[1630]                 45

    _King._ So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

    _Ham._ I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for[1631]
    England! Farewell, dear mother.

    _King._ Thy loving father, Hamlet.

    _Ham._ My mother: father and mother is man and                    50
    wife; man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.[1632]
    Come, for England!                                          [_Exit._

    _King._ Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;[1633]
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
    Away! for every thing is seal'd and done                          55
    That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.[1634]

                                 [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._

    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe                          60
    Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set[1635]
    Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,[1636]
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,                         65
    And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.            [_Exit._[1637]


SCENE IV. _A plain in Denmark._

   _Enter_ FORTINBRAS, _a_ Captain _and_ Soldiers, _marching_.[1638]

    _For._ Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;[1639]
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promised march[1640]
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.[1641]
    If that his majesty would aught with us,                           5
    We shall express our duty in his eye;[1642]
    And let him know so.

    _Cap._               I will do't, my lord.

    _For._ Go softly on.[1643]

                               [_Exeunt Fortinbras and Soldiers._[1643]

 _Enter_ HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, _and others_.[1643][1644]

    _Ham._ Good sir, whose powers are these?[1643][1645]

    _Cap._ They are of Norway, sir.[1643][1645][1646]                 10

    _Ham._ How purposed, sir, I pray you?[1643][1645][1647]

    _Cap._ Against some part of Poland.[1643][1645][1648]

    _Ham._ Who commands them, sir?[1643][1645]

    _Cap._ The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.[1645][1649]

    _Ham._ Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,[1645]             15
    Or for some frontier?[1645]

    _Cap._ Truly to speak, and with no addition,[1645][1650]
    We go to gain a little patch of ground[1645]
    That hath in it no profit but the name.[1645]
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;[1645][1651]        20
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole[1645]
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.[1645][1652]

    _Ham._ Why, then the Polack never will defend it.[1645]

    _Cap._ Yes, it is already garrison'd.[1645][1653]

    _Ham._ Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats[1645][1654][1655]  25
    Will not debate the question of this straw:[1645][1655]
    This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,[1645]
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without[1645]
    Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.[1645]

    _Cap._ God be wi' you, sir.                           [_Exit._[1645]

    _Ros._                Will't please you go, my lord?[1645][1656]  30

    _Ham._ I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.[1645]

                                  [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._[1645][1657]

    How all occasions do inform against me,[1645]
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,[1645]
    If his chief good and market of his time[1645]
    Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.[1645]                 35
    Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,[1645]
    Looking before and after, gave us not[1645]
    That capability and god-like reason[1645]
    To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be[1645][1658]
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple[1645]                    40
    Of thinking too precisely on the event,--[1645]
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom[1645]
    And ever three parts coward,--I do not know[1645][1659]
    Why yet I live to say 'this thing's to do,'[1645][1659]
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means,[1645]       45
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:[1645]
    Witness this army, of such mass and charge,[1645]
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,[1645]
    Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd[1645]
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,[1645]                        50
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure[1645]
    To all that fortune, death and danger dare,[1645]
    Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great[1645][1660]
    Is not to stir without great argument,[1645][1660][1661]
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw[1645]                      55
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,[1645]
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,[1645]
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,[1645]
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see[1645]
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men,[1645][1662]            60

    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,[1645]

    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,[1645][1664]           65

SCENE V. _Elsinore. A room in the castle._

            _Enter_ QUEEN, HORATIO, _and a_ Gentleman.[1665]

    _Queen._ I will not speak with her.

    _Gent._ She is importunate, indeed distract:[1666][1667]
    Her mood will needs be pitied.[1667]

    _Queen._                       What would she have?

    _Gent._ She speaks much of her father, says she hears[1666]
    There's tricks i' the world, and hems and beats her heart,         5
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,[1668]
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;[1669]           10
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,[1670]
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,[1671]
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

    _Hor._ 'Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew[1672]
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.[1672]                15

    _Queen._ Let her come in.       [_Exit Gentleman._[1672][1673][1674]
    [_Aside_] To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,[1674][1675][1676]
    Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:[1676]
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt,[1676]
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.[1676][1677]              20

                 _Re-enter_ Gentleman, _with_ OPHELIA.

    _Oph._  Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

    _Queen._  How now, Ophelia![1678]

    _Oph._ [_Sings_] How should I your true love know[1679][1680]
                  From another one?[1680]
                By his cockle hat and staff[1680]                     25
                  And his sandal shoon.[1680][1681]

    _Queen._ Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

    _Oph._ Say you? nay, pray you, mark.[1682]
    [_Sings_] He is dead and gone, lady,[1683][1684][1685]

                At his head a grass-green turf,[1685][1686]
                  At his heels a stone.[1685]
    Oh, oh![1687]

    _Queen._ Nay, but, Ophelia,--

    _Oph._                        Pray you, mark.
    [_Sings_] White his shroud as the mountain snow,--

                          _Enter_ KING.[1688]

    _Queen._ Alas, look here, my lord.                                35

    _Oph._ [_Sings_] Larded with sweet flowers;[1689]
                Which bewept to the grave did go[1690]
                  With true-love showers.[1691]

    _King._ How do you, pretty lady?[1692]

    _Oph._ Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a[1693]           40
    baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know[1694]
    not what we may be. God be at your table![1695]

    _King._ Conceit upon her father.

    _Oph._ Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when[1696]
    they ask you what it means, say you this:                         45
    [_Sings_] To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,[1697][1698][1699]
                  All in the morning betime,[1698][1700]
                And I a maid at your window,[1698]
                  To be your Valentine.[1698]
                Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,[1701][1702]  50
                  And dupp'd the chamber-door;[1701][1703]
                Let in the maid, that out a maid[1701][1704]
                  Never departed more.[1701]

    _King._ Pretty Ophelia!

    _Oph._ Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:[1705]  55
    [_Sings_] By Gis and by Saint Charity,[1706][1707]
                  Alack, and fie for shame![1707]
                Young men will do't, if they come to't;[1707]

                  You promised me to wed.[1710]

                So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
                  An thou hadst not come to my bed.[1712]

    _King._  How long hath she been thus?[1713]

    _Oph._ I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but           65
    I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i'[1714]
    the cold ground. My brother shall know of it: and so I
    thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach!
    Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night,[1715]
    good night.                                 [_Exit._[1715][1716]  70

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs[1718]
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,[1719]
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies,[1720]
    But in battalions! First, her father slain:[1721]                 75
    Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
    Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,[1722]
    For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,[1723]
    In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia[1724]                 80
    Divided from herself and her fair judgement,
    Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:[1725]
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France,
    Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,[1726]               85
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear[1727]
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,[1728]
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign[1729]
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,                         90
    Like to a murdering-piece, in many places[1730][1731]
    Gives me superfluous death.                 [_A noise within._[1731]

    _Queen._                    Alack, what noise is this?[1732]

    _King._ Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.[1733][1734]

                   _Enter another_ Gentleman.[1734]

    What is the matter?[1734]

    _Gent._             Save yourself, my lord:[1734][1735]
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,                               95
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste[1736]
    Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;[1737]
    And, as the world were now but to begin,[1738]
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,[1738]                        100
    The ratifiers and props of every word,[1738][1739][1740]
    They cry 'Choose we; Laertes shall be king!'[1739][1741]
    Caps, hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds,[1742]
    'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'[1743]

    _Queen._ How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!             105
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!    [_Noise within._[1744]

    _King._ The doors are broke.

           _Enter_ LAERTES, _armed_; Danes _following_.[1745]

    _Laer._ Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.[1746]

    _Danes._ No, let's come in.[1747]

    _Laer._                     I pray you, give me leave.

    _Danes._  We will, we will.                                      110

                           [_They retire without the door._[1747][1748]

    _Laer._  I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,[1749][1750]
    Give me my father![1749]

    _Queen._           Calmly, good Laertes.

    _Laer._  That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;[1751]
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow[1752]              115
    Of my true mother.

    _King._            What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
    Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
    That treason can but peep to what it would,[1753]                120
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,[1754]
    Why thou art thus incensed: let him go, Gertrude:[1755]
    Speak, man.

    _Laer._ Where is my father?

    _King._                     Dead.

    _Queen._                          But not by him.[1756]

    _King._ Let him demand his fill.                                 125

    _Laer._ How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil![1757]
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit![1758]
    I dare damnation: to this point I stand,[1758]
    That both the worlds I give to negligence,                       130
    Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
    Most throughly for my father.

    _King._                       Who shall stay you?

    _Laer._ My will, not all the world:[1759]
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
    They shall go far with little.[1760]

    _King._                        Good Laertes,[1761]               135
    If you desire to know the certainty[1761]
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,[1762]
    That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,[1763]
    Winner and loser?[1764]

    _Laer._ None but his enemies.

    _King._                       Will you know them then?[1765]     140

    _Laer._ To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;[1766]
    And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,[1767]
    Repast them with my blood.[1768]

    _King._                    Why, now you speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,                      145
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,[1769]
    It shall as level to your judgement pierce[1770]
    As day does to your eye.

    _Danes._ [_Within_] Let her come in.

    _Laer._ How now! what noise is that?

    O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,                150
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye![1772]
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid with weight,[1773]
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May![1774]
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits                     155
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?[1775]
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine[1776][1777]
    It sends some precious instance of itself[1776][1777]
    After the thing it loves.[1776]

    _Oph._ [_Sings_] They bore him barefaced on the bier;[1778]      160

                And in his grave rain'd many a tear,--[1780]
    Fare you well, my dove![1781]

    _Laer._ Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,[1782]
    It could not move thus.[1782][1783]                              165

    _Laer._  This nothing's more than matter.[1787]                  170

    _Oph._ There's rosemary, that's for remembrance: pray[1788][1789]
    you, love, remember: and there is pansies, that's for[1789][1790]
    thoughts.

    _Laer._ A document in madness; thoughts and remembrance
    fitted.                                                          175

    _Oph._ There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's
    rue for you; and here's some for me: we may call it herb[1791]
    of grace o' Sundays: O, you must wear your rue with a[1791][1792]
    difference. There's a daisy: I would give you some
    violets, but they withered all when my father died: they         180
    say a' made a good end,--[1793]

    [_Sings_] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.[1794]

    She turns to favour and to prettiness.

    _Oph._ [_Sings_] And will a' not come again?[1796][1797]         185
                And will a' not come again?[1797]
                  No, no, he is dead,[1798]
                  Go to thy death-bed,[1798][1799]
                He never will come again.

                His beard was as white as snow,[1800]                190
                All flaxen was his poll:[1801]
                  He is gone, he is gone,[1802]

    _Laer._  Do you see this, O God?[1805]

    _King._  Laertes, I must commune with your grief,[1806]

    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:                 200
    If by direct or by collateral hand[1807]

    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,[1809]                205

    _Hor._ [_Reads_] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have over-looked[1825]

    the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I[1830]      25
    am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for
    England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.[1831]
                   'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'[1832]

    Come, I will make you way for these your letters;[1833]
    And do't the speedier, that you may direct me                     30
    To him from whom you brought them.                  [_Exeunt._[1834]


SCENE VII. _Another room in the castle._[1835]

                      _Enter_ KING _and_ LAERTES.

    _King._ Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And you must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain[1836]
    Pursued my life.

    _Laer._          It well appears: but tell me                      5
    Why you proceeded not against these feats,[1837]
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,[1838]
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,[1839]
    You mainly were stirr'd up.

    _King._                     O, for two special reasons,[1840]
    Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew'd,[1841]               10
    But yet to me they're strong. The queen his mother[1842]
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which--[1843]
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,[1844]
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,                    15
    I could not but by her. The other motive,
    Why to a public count I might not go,
    Is the great love the general gender bear him;
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,[1845]          20
    Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,[1846]
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,[1847]
    Would have reverted to my bow again[1848]
    And not where I had aim'd them.[1849]

    _Laer._ And so have I a noble father lost;[1850]                  25
    A sister driven into desperate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,[1851]
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age[1852]
    For her perfections: but my revenge will come.[1853]

    _King._ Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think[1854]  30
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger[1855]
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:[1856]
    I loved your father, and we love ourself;[1857]
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--[1858]               35

                  _Enter a_ Messenger, _with letters_.

    How now! what news?[1859]

    _Mess._                   Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your majesty; this to the queen.[1860]

    _King._ From Hamlet! who brought them?[1861]

    _Mess._ Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
    They were given me by Claudio; he received them                   40
    Of him that brought them.

    _King._                   Laertes, you shall hear them.[1862]
    Leave us.                                   [_Exit Messenger._[1863]

    [_Reads_] 'High and mighty, You shall know I am set[1864]
    naked on your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave[1865]
    to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your[1866][1867]  45
    pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and[1866][1868][1869]
    more strange return.[1869]
                                                'HAMLET.'[1870]

    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?[1871]                     50

    _Laer._ Know you the hand?

    _King._ Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'[1872][1873]
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'[1872][1873]
    Can you advise me?[1872][1874]

    _Laer._ I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;[1875]          55
    It warms the very sickness in my heart,
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,[1876]
    'Thus didest thou.'[1877]

    _King._             If it be so, Laertes,--[1878]
    As how should it be so? how otherwise?--[1878][1879]
    Will you be ruled by me?[1878]

    _Laer._                  Ay, my lord;[1880][1881]                 60
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.[1880]

    _King._ To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,[1882]
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means[1883]
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To an exploit now ripe in my device,[1884]                        65
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
    And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe;
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice,
    And call it accident.[1885]

    _Laer._               My lord, I will be ruled;[1886][1887]
    The rather, if you could devise it so[1886]                       70
    That I might be the organ.[1886][1888]

    _King._                    It falls right.[1886]
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,[1886]
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality[1886]
    Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts[1886]
    Did not together pluck such envy from him,[1886]                  75
    As did that one, and that in my regard[1886]
    Of the unworthiest siege.[1886]

    _Laer._                   What part is that, my lord?[1886]

    _King._ A very riband in the cap of youth,[1886][1889]
    Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes[1886]
    The light and careless livery that it wears[1886]                 80
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,[1886]
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since,[1886][1890]
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--[1891]
    I've seen myself, and served against, the French,[1892]
    And they can well on horseback: but this gallant[1893]            85
    Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat,[1894]
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured[1895]
    With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought[1896]
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,                          90
    Come short of what he did.[1897]

    _Laer._                    A Norman was't?

    _King._ A Norman.

    _Laer._ Upon my life, Lamond.

    _King._                       The very same.[1898]

    _Laer._ I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
    And gem of all the nation.[1899]                                  95

    _King._ He made confession of you,[1900]
    And gave you such a masterly report,
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especial,[1901]
    That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed[1902]               100
    If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation.[1903][1904]
    He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,[1903]
    If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his[1903]
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy[1905]
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg                        105
    Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.[1906]
    Now, out of this--

    _Laer._            What out of this, my lord?

    _King._ Laertes, was your father dear to you?[1907]
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart?

    _Laer._                 Why ask you this?                        110

    _King._ Not that I think you did not love your father,
    But that I know love is begun by time,[1908]
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love[1909]                  115
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;[1909][1910]
    And nothing is at a like goodness still,[1909]
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,[1909][1911]
    Dies in his own too much: that we would do[1909][1912]
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes[1909][1913]  120
    And hath abatements and delays as many[1909]
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents,[1909][1914]
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,[1909][1913][1915]
    That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:[1909]
    Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,[1916]               125
    To show yourself your father's son in deed[1917]
    More than in words?

    _Laer._             To cut his throat i' the church.

    _King._ No place indeed should murder sanctuarize;[1918]
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.[1919]          130
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame[1920]
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together[1921]
    And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,[1922]                 135
    Most generous and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils, so that with ease,[1923]
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice[1924]
    Requite him for your father.

    _Laer._                      I will do't                         140
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.[1925]
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that but dip a knife in it,[1926]
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue                      145
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,[1927][1928]
    It may be death.[1927]

    _King._          Let's further think of this;
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means[1929]              150
    May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,[1930]
    And that our drift look through our bad performance,[1931]
    'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see:[1932]              155
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings:[1933]
    I ha't:[1934][1935]
    When in your motion you are hot and dry--[1935][1936]
    As make your bouts more violent to that end--[1937]
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him[1938]        160
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,[1939]
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,[1940]
    Our purpose may hold there. But stay, what noise?

                          _Enter_ QUEEN.[1941]

    How now, sweet queen![1942]

    _Queen._ One woe doth tread upon another's heel,[1943]           165
    So fast they follow: your sister's drown'd, Laertes.[1944]

    _Laer._ Drown'd! O, where?

    _Queen._ There is a willow grows aslant a brook,[1945]
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;[1946]
    There with fantastic garlands did she come[1947]                 170
    Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,[1948]
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:[1949]
    There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds[1950]
    Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;[1951]               175
    When down her weedy trophies and herself[1952]
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,
    And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up:[1953]
    Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes,[1954]
    As one incapable of her own distress,                            180
    Or like a creature native and indued[1955]
    Unto that element: but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,[1956]
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay[1957]
    To muddy death.

    _Laer._         Alas, then she is drown'd![1958]                 185

    _Queen._ Drown'd, drown'd.

    _Laer._ Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,                 190
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
    I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze,[1959]
    But that this folly douts it.                         [_Exit._[1960]

    _King._                       Let's follow, Gertrude:
    How much I had to do to calm his rage![1961]
    Now fear I this will give it start again;                        195
    Therefore let's follow.                                   [_Exeunt._

ACT V.


SCENE I. _A churchyard._

              _Enter two_ Clowns, _with spades, &c._[1962]

    _First Clo._ Is she to be buried in Christian burial that[1963][1964]
    wilfully seeks her own salvation?

    _Sec. Clo._ I tell thee she is; and therefore make her[1965][1966]
    grave straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
    Christian burial.                                                  5

    _First Clo._ How can that be, unless she drowned herself[1963][1967]
    in her own defence?

    _Sec. Clo._ Why, 'tis found so.[1965]

    _First Clo._ It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else.[1968]
    For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues   10
    an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to[1969]
    do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.[1970]

    _Sec. Clo._ Nay, but hear you, goodman delver.[1971]

    _First Clo._ Give me leave. Here lies the water; good:[1972]
    here stands the man; good: if the man go to this water and[1973]  15
    drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes; mark you[1974]
    that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he[1975]
    drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own
    death shortens not his own life.

    _Sec. Clo._ But is this law?                                      20

    _First Clo._ Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.

    _Sec. Clo._ Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not[1976]
    been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'[1977]
    Christian burial.

    _First Clo._ Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that[1978]  25
    great folk should have countenance in this world to drown
    or hang themselves, more than their even Christian. Come,[1979]
    my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners,[1980]
    ditchers and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession.

    _Sec. Clo._ Was he a gentleman?                                   30

    _First Clo._ A' was the first that ever bore arms.[1981]

    _Sec. Clo._ Why, he had none.[1982]

    _First Clo._ What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand[1982][1983]
    the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digged:[1982]
    could he dig without arms? I'll put another question[1982]        35
    to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess[1984]
    thyself--[1985]

    _Sec. Clo._ Go to.

    _First Clo._ What is he that builds stronger than either
    the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?                      40

    _Sec. Clo._ The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a[1986]
    thousand tenants.

    _First Clo._ I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
    does well; but how does it well? it does well to those that
    do ill: now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger   45
    than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee.
    To't again, come.

    _Sec. Clo._ 'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,
    or a carpenter?'[1987]

    _First Clo._ Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.                        50

    _Sec. Clo._ Marry, now I can tell.

    _First Clo._ To't.

    _Sec. Clo._ Mass, I cannot tell.

            _Enter_ HAMLET _and_ HORATIO, _afar off_.[1988]

    _First Clo._ Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your
    dull ass will not mend his pace with beating, and when            55
    you are asked this question next, say 'a grave-maker:' the
    houses that he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to[1989][1990]
    Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor. [_Exit Sec. Clown._[1990][1991]

                                                  [_He digs, and sings._

                In youth, when I did love, did love,
                  Methought it was very sweet,                        60
                To contract, O, the time, for-a my behove,[1992]
                  O, methought, there-a was nothing-a meet.[1993]

    _Ham._ Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that[1994][1995]
    he sings at grave-making?[1995]

    _Hor._ Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.[1996]   65

    _Ham._ 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
    the daintier sense.[1997]

    _First Clo._ [_Sings_] But age, with his stealing steps,[1998][1999]
                  Hath claw'd me in his clutch,[1999][2000]           70
                And hath shipped me intil the land,[1999][2001]
                  As if I had never been such.[2002]

                                                   [_Throws up a skull._

    _Ham._ That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing
    once: how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were[2003]
    Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It might be[2004]     75
    the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-reaches;[2005]
    one that would circumvent God, might it not?[2006]

    _Hor._ It might, my lord.

    _Ham._ Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow,
    sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?' This might[2007]          80
    be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one's[2008]
    horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?[2009]

    _Hor._ Ay, my lord.

    _Ham._ Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's;[2010]
    chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's[2011]     85
    spade: here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see't.[2012]
    Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at
    loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.[2013]

    _First Clo._ [_Sings_] A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,[1998]
                  For and a shrouding sheet:[2014]                    90
                O, a pit of clay for to be made
                  For such a guest is meet.

                                         [Throws up another skull.[2015]

    _Ham._ There's another: why may not that be the skull[2016]
    of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his[2017]
    cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this       95
    rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty[2018]
    shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum![2019]
    This fellow might be in 's time a great buyer of land, with
    his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
    his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines and the recovery[2020]  100
    of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will[2020][2021]
    his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double[2022][2023]
    ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures?[2023]
    The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in[2024]
    this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?       105

    _Hor._ Not a jot more, my lord.

    _Ham._ Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?

    _Hor._ Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.[2025]

    _Ham._ They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance[2026]
    in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's              110
    this, sirrah?[2027]

    _First Clo._ Mine, sir.[2028]
       [_Sings_] O, a pit of clay for to be made[2028][2029]
                  For such a guest is meet.[2030]

    _Ham._ I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.[2031]    115

    _First Clo._ You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not[2032]
    yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.[2033]

    _Ham._ Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
    'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

    _First Clo._ 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from[2034]  120
    me to you.

    _Ham._ What man dost thou dig it for?

    _First Clo._ For no man, sir.

    _Ham._ What woman then?

    _First Clo._ For none, neither.                                  125

    _Ham._ Who is to be buried in 't?

    _First Clo._ One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her
    soul, she's dead.

    _Ham._ How absolute the knave is! we must speak by
    the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,[2035]       130
    Horatio, this three years I have taken note of it; the age[2036]
    is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so[2037]
    near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe. How long[2038]
    hast thou been a grave-maker?[2039]

    _First Clo._ Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that[2040]  135
    day that our last king Hamlet o'ercame Fortinbras.[2041]

    _Ham._ How long is that since?

    _First Clo._ Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell
    that: it was that very day that young Hamlet was born;[2042]
    he that is mad, and sent into England.[2043]                     140

    _Ham._ Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

    _First Clo._ Why, because a' was mad: a' shall recover[2044]
    his wits there; or, if a' do not, 'tis no great matter there.[2044][2045]

    _Ham._ Why?

    _First Clo._ 'Twill not be seen in him there; there the[2046]    145
    men are as mad as he.[2046]

    _Ham._ How came he mad?

    _First Clo._ Very strangely, they say.

    _Ham._ How 'strangely'?

    _First Clo._ Faith, e'en with losing his wits.                   150

    _Ham._ Upon what ground?

    _First Clo._ Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton[2047]
    here, man and boy, thirty years.[2048]

    _Ham._ How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?

    _First Clo._ I'faith, if a' be not rotten before a' die--as[2049][2050]  155
    we have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce[2051]
    hold the laying in--a' will last you some eight year or nine[2051]
    year: a tanner will last you nine year.[2052]

    _Ham._ Why he more than another?

    _First Clo._ Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade[2053]  160
    that a' will keep out water a great while; and your water is[2054]
    a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull[2055]
    now: this skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years.[2055][2056]

    _Ham._ Whose was it?

    _First Clo._ A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do[2057]      165
    you think it was?[2057]

    _Ham._ Nay, I know not.

    _First Clo._ A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a'[2058]
    poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same[2059]
    skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.[2059][2060]   170

    _Ham._ This?

    _First Clo._ E'en that.

    _Ham._ Let me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor[2061]
    Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of
    most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a[2062]       175
    thousand times; and now how abhorred in my imagination[2063][2064]
    it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I[2064]
    have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,[2065]
    that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one[2066]         180
    now, to mock your own grinning? quite chop-fallen? Now[2067]
    get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint[2068]
    an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her[2069]
    laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.

    _Hor._ What's that, my lord?                                     185

    _Ham._ Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion[2070]
    i' the earth?

    _Hor._ E'en so.

    _Ham._ And smelt so? pah!              [_Puts down the skull._[2071]

    _Hor._ E'en so, my lord.                                         190

    _Ham._ To what base uses we may return, Horatio![2072]
    Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
    till he find it stopping a bung-hole?[2073]

    _Hor._ 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

    _Ham._ No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither[2074]     195
    with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it: as thus:[2075]
    Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth[2076]
    into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam;[2077]
    and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might[2078]
    they not stop a beer-barrel?                                     200
          Imperious Cæsar, dead and turn'd to clay,[2079]
          Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
          O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
          Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw![2080]
    But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.                  205

  _Enter_ Priests, _&c. in procession; the Corpse of Ophelia_, LAERTES
   _and_ Mourners _following_; KING, QUEEN, _their trains, &c._[2081]

    The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?[2082]
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken[2083]
    The corse they follow did with desperate hand
    Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.[2084]
    Couch we awhile, and mark.      [_Retiring with Horatio._[2085]  210

    _Laer._ What ceremony else?[2086]

    _Ham._ That is Laertes, a very noble youth: mark.[2087]

    _Laer._ What ceremony else?

    _First Priest._ Her obsequies have been as far enlarged[2088][2089]
    As we have warranty: her death was doubtful;[2090]               215
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodged[2091]
    Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,[2092]
    Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her:[2093]
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,[2094]                 220
    Her maiden strewments and the bringing home[2095]
    Of bell and burial.

    _Laer._ Must there no more be done?[2096]

    _First Priest._                     No more be done:[2088]
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her[2097]                     225
    As to peace-parted souls.

    _Laer._                   Lay her i' the earth:[2098]
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A ministering angel shall my sister be,
    When thou liest howling.

    _Ham._                   What, the fair Ophelia!                 230

    _Queen._ [_Scattering flowers_] Sweets to the sweet: farewell![2099]
    I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;[2100]
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.

    _Laer._                         O, treble woe[2101]
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head[2102]                  235
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense[2103]
    Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:

                                          [_Leaps into the grave._[2104]

    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made                       240
    To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head[2105]
    Of blue Olympus.[2106][2107]

    _Ham._ [_Advancing_] What is he whose grief[2107]
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow[2108]
    Conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,[2109]                    245
    Hamlet the Dane.                            [_Leaps into the grave._

    _Laer._          The devil take thy soul!

                                            [_Grappling with him._[2110]

    _Ham._ Thou pray'st not well.[2111]
    I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;[2111]
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,[2112]
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,[2113]                      250
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand.[2114]

    _King._ Pluck them asunder.

    _Queen._                    Hamlet, Hamlet!

    _All._                                      Gentlemen,--

    _Hor._ Good my lord, be quiet.

      [_The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave._[2115]

    _Ham._ Why, I will fight with him upon this theme[2116]
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.                             255

    _Queen._ O my son, what theme?

    _Ham._ I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
    Could not, with all their quantity of love,[2117]
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

    _King._ O, he is mad, Laertes.                                   260

    _Queen._ For love of God, forbear him.

    _Ham._ 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:[2118]
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?[2119][2120]
    Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?[2119][2121]
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?[2122]                   265
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?[2123]
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
    And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,[2124]                270
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,[2125]
    I'll rant as well as thou.

    _Queen._                   This is mere madness:[2126][2127]
    And thus awhile the fit will work on him;[2128]
    Anon, as patient as the female dove[2127][2129]
    When that her golden couplets are disclosed,[2130]               275
    His silence will sit drooping.

    _Ham._                         Hear you, sir;
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I loved you ever: but it is no matter;[2131]
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.     [_Exit._[2132]  280
    King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

                                                  [_Exit Horatio._[2133]

    [_To Laertes_] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;[2134]
    We'll put the matter to the present push.
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
    This grave shall have a living monument:                         285
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;[2135]
    Till then, in patience our proceeding be.           [_Exeunt._[2136]


SCENE II. _A hall in the castle._[2137]

                     _Enter_ HAMLET _and_ HORATIO.

    _Ham._ So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;[2138]
    You do remember all the circumstance?[2139]

    _Hor._ Remember it, my lord!

    _Ham._ Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
    That would not let me sleep: methought I lay[2140]                 5
    Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,[2141][2142]
    And praised be rashness for it, let us know,[2142][2143][2144][2145]
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well[2144][2145][2146]
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us[2144][2147]
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,[2144]                    10
    Rough-hew them how we will.[2144]

    _Hor._                      That is most certain.

    _Ham._ Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark[2148]
    Groped I to find out them; had my desire,[2149]
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew                       15
    To mine own room again; making so bold,[2150][2151]
    My fears forgetting manners, to unseal[2151][2152]
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
    O royal knavery!--an exact command,[2153]
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,[2154]                  20
    Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
    With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,[2155]
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,[2156]
    My head should be struck off.[2157]

    _Hor._                        Is't possible?                      25

    _Ham._ Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?[2158]

    _Hor._ I beseech you.[2159]

    _Ham._ Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--[2160][2161]
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,[2160][2162]              30
    They had begun the play,--I sat me down;[2160][2163]
    Devised a new commission; wrote it fair:
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much[2164]
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now                        35
    It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know[2165]
    The effect of what I wrote?[2166]

    _Hor._                      Ay, good my lord.

    _Ham._ An earnest conjuration from the king,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,[2167]          40
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,[2168]
    And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,[2169]
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,[2170]
    Without debatement further, more or less,                         45
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,[2171]
    Not shriving-time allow'd.[2172]

    _Hor._                     How was this seal'd?

    _Ham._ Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.[2173]
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal:                          50
    Folded the writ up in the form of the other;[2174]
    Subscribed it; gave't the impression; placed it safely,[2175]
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day[2176]
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent[2177]
    Thou know'st already.[2178]                                       55

    _Hor._ So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.[2179]

    _Ham._ Why, man, they did make love to this employment;[2180]
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat[2181]
    Does by their own insinuation grow:[2182]
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes[2183]                  60
    Between the pass and fell incensed points[2184]
    Of mighty opposites.

    _Hor._               Why, what a king is this!

    _Ham._ Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon--[2185]
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whored my mother;[2186]
    Popp'd in between the election and my hopes;[2187]                65
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,[2188]
    And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,[2189]
    To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,[2190][2191]
    To let this canker of our nature come[2190]
    In further evil?[2190][2192]                                      70

    _Hor._ It must be shortly known to him from England[2190]
    What is the issue of the business there.[2190]

    _Ham._ It will be short: the interim is mine;[2190][2193][2194]
    And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'[2190][2193][2195]
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,[2190][2193]                    75
    That to Laertes I forgot myself;[2190]
    For, by the image of my cause, I see[2190]
    The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:[2190][2196]
    But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me[2190]
    Into a towering passion.[2190]

    _Hor._                   Peace! who comes here?[2190][2197]       80

                             _Enter_ OSRIC.

    _Osr._ Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.[2198][2199]

    _Ham._ I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?[2200][2201]

    _Hor._ No, my good lord.[2201]

    _Ham._ Thy state is the more gracious, for 'tis a vice to[2201]
    know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be[2201]    85
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess:[2201]
    'tis a chough, but, as I say, spacious in the possession of
        dirt.[2201][2202]

    _Osr._ Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I[2203]
    should impart a thing to you from his majesty.

    _Ham._ I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.[2204]  90
    Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.[2205]

    _Osr._ I thank your lordship, it is very hot.[2206]

    _Ham._ No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
    northerly.

    _Osr._ It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.                   95

    _Ham._ But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot, or my[2207][2208]
    complexion--[2208]

    _Osr._ Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere,--I[2209]
    cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me[2210]
    signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head:[2211]  100
    sir, this is the matter--[2212]

    _Ham._ I beseech you, remember--[2213]

                                  [_Hamlet moves him to put on his hat._

    _Osr._ Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.[2214]
    Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute[2215]
    gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very[2215][2216]  105
    soft society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of[2215][2217]
    him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find[2215][2218]
    in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.[2215][2219]

    _Ham._ Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;[2215]
    though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the[2215][2220]  110
    arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect[2215][2221]
    of his quick sail. But in the verity of extolment, I take[2215]
    him to be a soul of great article, and his infusion of such[2215][2222]
    dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his[2215]
    semblable is his mirror, and who else would trace him, his[2215]  115
    umbrage, nothing more.[2215]

    _Osr._ Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.[2215]

    _Ham._ The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the[2215][2223]
    gentleman in our more rawer breath?[2215]

    _Osr._ Sir?[2215][2224]                                          120

    _Hor._ Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?[2215][2225]
    You will do't, sir, really.[2215][2226]

    _Ham._ What imports the nomination of this gentleman?[2215]

    _Osr._ Of Laertes?[2215][2227]

    _Hor._ His purse is empty already; all's golden words[2215]      125
    are spent.[2215]

    _Ham._ Of him, sir.[2215][2228]

    _Osr._ I know you are not ignorant--[2215][2229]

    _Ham._ I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it[2215]
    would not much approve me. Well, sir?[2215][2230]                130

    _Osr._ You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--[2215][2231]

    _Ham._ I dare not confess that, lest I should compare[2215]
    with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to[2215][2232]
    know himself.[2215]

    _Osr._ I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation[2215][2233]  135
    laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.[2215][2234]

    _Ham._ What's his weapon?

    _Osr._ Rapier and dagger.

    _Ham._ That's two of his weapons: but, well.

    _Osr._ The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary[2235]    140
    horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six[2236]
    French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle,
    hanger, and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very[2237]
    dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate
    carriages, and of very liberal conceit.                          145

    _Ham._ What call you the carriages?

    _Hor._ I knew you must be edified by the margent ere[2238]
    you had done.[2238]

    _Osr._ The carriages, sir, are the hangers.[2239]

    _Ham._ The phrase would be more germane to the[2240]             150
    matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides: I would[2241]
    it might be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses[2242]
    against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited
    carriages; that's the French bet against the[2243][2244]
    Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?[2244][2245]       155

    _Osr._ The king, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen[2246]
    passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you[2247]
    three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would[2248]
    come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe
    the answer.                                                      160

    _Ham._  How if I answer 'no'?

    _Osr._ I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person
    in trial.

    _Ham._  Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his[2249]
    majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me; let the[2249][2250]  165
    foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold[2251]
    his purpose, I will win for him an I can; if not, I will gain[2252]
    nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

    _Osr._  Shall I redeliver you e'en so?[2253]

    _Ham._  To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature[2254]  170
    will.

    _Osr._ I commend my duty to your lordship.[2255]

    _Ham._ Yours, yours. [_Exit Osric._] He does well to[2256]
    commend it himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.[2257]

    _Hor._ This lapwing runs away with the shell on his[2258]        175
    head.

    _Ham._ He did comply with his dug before he sucked[2259]
    it. Thus has he--and many more of the same breed that[2260]
    I know the drossy age dotes on--only got the tune of the
    time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yesty[2261][2262]  180
    collection, which carries them through and through the most[2261]
    fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to[2263]
    their trial, the bubbles are out.[2264]

                         _Enter a_ Lord.[2265]

    _Lord._ My lord, his majesty commended him to you by[2265]
    young Osric, who brings back to him, that you attend him[2265][2266]  185
    in the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play[2265]
    with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.[2265]

    _Ham._ I am constant to my purposes; they follow the[2265]
    king's pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or[2265]
    whensoever, provided I be so able as now.[2265]                  190

    _Lord._ The king and queen and all are coming down.[2265]

    _Ham._ In happy time.[2265]

    _Lord._ The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment[2265][2267]
    to Laertes before you fall to play.[2265][2268]

    _Ham._ She well instructs me.        [_Exit Lord._[2265][2269]   195

    _Hor._ You will lose this wager, my lord.[2270]

    _Ham._ I do not think so; since he went into France, I
    have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds.
    But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my[2271]
    heart: but it is no matter.                                      200

    _Hor._ Nay, good my lord,--[2272]

    _Ham._ It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving[2273]
    as would perhaps trouble a woman.[2273]

    _Hor._ If your mind dislike any thing, obey it. I will[2274]
    forestal their repair hither, and say you are not fit.           205

    _Ham._ Not a whit; we defy augury: there is special[2275]
    providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to[2276]
    come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now,
    yet it will come: the readiness is all; since no man has[2277][2278]
    aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes? Let         210
    be.[2278]

_Enter_ KING, QUEEN, LAERTES, _and_ Lords, OSRIC _and other_ Attendants
  _with foils and gauntlets; a table and flagons of wine on it_.[2279]

    _King._ Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.[2280]

                           [_The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's._

    _Ham._ Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;[2281]
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.[2282]
    This presence knows,[2282][2283][2284]                           215
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd[2283][2284][2285]
    With sore distraction. What I have done,[2283][2284][2286]
    That might your nature, honour and exception[2284][2287]
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.[2284]
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:[2284]                220
    If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,[2284]
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,[2284]
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.[2284]
    Who does it then? His madness: if't be so,[2284][2288]
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;[2284][2289]            225
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.[2284]
    Sir, in this audience,[2284][2290]
    Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
    That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,[2291]                230
    And hurt my brother.[2292]

    _Laer._              I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
    To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement,
    Till by some elder masters of known honour[2293]                 235
    I have a voice and precedent of peace,[2294]
    To keep my name ungored. But till that time[2295]
    I do receive your offer'd love like love[2296]
    And will not wrong it.

    _Ham._                 I embrace it freely,[2297][2298]
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.[2298]                240
    Give us the foils. Come on.[2299]

    _Laer._                     Come, one for me.

    _Ham._ I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,[2300]
    Stick fiery off indeed.[2301]

    _Laer._                 You mock me, sir.

    _Ham._ No, by this hand.[2302]                                   245

    _King._ Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin[2303][2304]
    Hamlet,[2303]
    You know the wager?

    _Ham._              Very well, my lord;[2305][2306]
    Your grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.[2306][2307]

    _King._ I do not fear it; I have seen you both:[2308]
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.[2309]          250

    _Laer._ This is too heavy; let me see another.[2310][2311]

    _Ham._ This likes me well. These foils have all a length?[2310][2312]

                                                [_They prepare to play._

    _Osr._ Ay, my good lord.

    _King._ Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.[2313]
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,[2314]                    255
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,[2315]
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
    And in the cup an union shall he throw,[2316]
    Richer than that which four successive kings                     260
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;[2317]
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,[2318]
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,[2319]
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,[2320]
    'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin;[2321]              265
    And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.

    _Ham._ Come on, sir.

    _Laer._              Come, my lord.              [_They play._[2322]

    _Ham._                              One.

    _Laer._                                  No.

    _Ham._                                       Judgement.

    _Osr._ A hit, a very palpable hit.[2323]

    _Laer._                            Well; again.

    _King._ Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;[2324]
    Here's to thy health.

                    [_Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within._[2325]

                      Give him the cup.                              270

    _Ham._ I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.[2326]
    Come. [_They play._]  Another hit; what say you?[2327]

    _Laer._ A touch, a touch, I do confess.[2328]

    _King._ Our son shall win.

    _Queen._                   He's fat and scant of breath.[2329]
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:[2330]               275
    The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

    _Ham._ Good madam!

    _King._            Gertrude, do not drink.[2331]

    _Queen._ I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.[2332]

    _King._ [_Aside_] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.[2333]

    _Ham._ I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.[2334]             280

    _Queen._ Come, let me wipe thy face.

    _Laer._ My lord, I'll hit him now.[2335]

    _King._                            I do not think't.

    _Laer._ [_Aside_] And yet it is almost against my conscience.[2333][2336]

    _Ham._ Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;[2337]
    I pray you, pass with your best violence;                        285
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.[2338]

    _Laer._ Say you so? come on.                     [_They play._[2339]

    _Osr._ Nothing, neither way.

    _Laer._ Have at you now!

                     [_Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they
                      change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes._[2340]

    _King._                  Part them; they are incensed.

    _Ham._ Nay, come, again.                         [_The Queen falls._

    _Osr._                   Look to the queen there, ho![2341]      290

    _Hor._ They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?[2342]

    _Osr._ How is't, Laertes?[2343]

    _Laer._ Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;[2344]
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.[2345]

    _Ham._ How does the queen?

    _King._                    She swounds to see them bleed.[2346]  295

    _Queen._ No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--[2347]
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.            [_Dies._[2347][2348]

    _Ham._ O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:[2349]
    Treachery! seek it out.

    _Laer._ It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;[2350]        300
    No medicine in the world can do thee good,[2351]
    In thee there is not half an hour of life;[2352]
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,[2353]
    Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice[2354]
    Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,[2355]                  305
    Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:[2356]
    I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.[2357]

    _Ham._ The point envenom'd too![2358][2359][2360]
    Then, venom, to thy work.       [_Stabs the King._[2358][2360][2361]

    _All._ Treason! treason!                                         310

    _King._ O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

    _Ham._ Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,[2362]
    Drink off this potion: is thy union here?[2363]
    Follow my mother.                                [_King dies._[2364]

    _Laer._           He is justly served;[2365]
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.[2365][2366]                  315
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,[2367]
    Nor thine on me!                                      [_Dies._[2368]

    _Ham._ Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.[2369]
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu![2370]                 320
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,[2371]
    Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,[2372]
    Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--[2372][2373]
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;                               325
    Thou livest; report me and my cause aright[2374]
    To the unsatisfied.

    _Hor._              Never believe it:[2375]
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:[2376]
    Here's yet some liquor left.

    _Ham._                       As thou'rt a man,[2377][2378]
    Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.[2377][2379]     330
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name,[2380]
    Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me![2381]
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,[2382]
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,                 335
    To tell my story.          [_March afar off, and shot within._[2383]
                      What warlike noise is this?

    _Osr._ Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,[2384]
    To the ambassadors of England gives[2385][2386][2387]
    This warlike volley.[2386]

    _Ham._               O, I die, Horatio;
    The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:[2388]              340
    I cannot live to hear the news from England;
    But I do prophesy the election lights
    On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
    So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,[2389]
    Which have solicited. The rest is silence.      [_Dies._[2390]   345

    _Hor._ Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,[2391]
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!  [_March within._[2392]
    Why does the drum come hither?

     _Enter_ FORTINBRAS, _and the_ English Ambassadors, _with drum,
                    colours, and_ Attendants.[2393]

    _Fort._ Where is this sight?

    _Hor._                       What is it you would see?[2394]
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.[2395]              350

    _Fort._ This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,[2396]
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,[2397]
    That thou so many princes at a shot[2398]
    So bloodily hast struck?

    _First Amb._             The sight is dismal;[2399]
    And our affairs from England come too late:                      355
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing.
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
    Where should we have our thanks?

    _Hor._                           Not from his mouth
    Had it the ability of life to thank you:[2400]                   360
    He never gave commandment for their death.[2401]
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,[2402]
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,[2403]
    Are here arrived, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;[2404]                     365
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world[2405]
    How these things came about: so shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,[2406]
    Of accidental judgements, casual slaughters,
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,[2407]              370
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on the inventors' heads: all this can I
    Truly deliver.

    _Fort._        Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.[2408]
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:                        375
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,[2409]
    Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.[2410]

    _Hor._ Of that I shall have also cause to speak,[2411]
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:[2412]
    But let this same be presently perform'd,[2413]                  380
    Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance[2414]
    On plots and errors happen.[2415]

    _Fort._                     Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;[2416]
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,[2417]         385
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war[2418]
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies: such a sight as this[2419]
    Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.[2420]
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.                                      390

                       [_A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the bodies:
                     after which a peal of ordnance is shot off._[2421]

    'Are of a most select and generous choice.' Lloyd conj.


NOTE IV.

I. 3. 109. The second and third Quartos include the words
'not ... thus' in a parenthesis. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth, the
parenthesis ends at 'phrase;' an arrangement, which was adopted by Pope
and corrected by Theobald at Warburton's suggestion. The Folios have no
parenthesis.


NOTE V.

I. 3. 117. Malone conjectured that some epithet to 'blazes' has been
omitted; and Coleridge 'did not doubt that a spondee had dropt out
of the line.' He proposed either 'Go to, these blazes, daughter,' or
'these blazes, daughter, mark you.' _Notes and Lectures_, 1. p. 220
(ed. 1849).


NOTE VI.

I. 4. 36, 37. We have left this corrupt passage unaltered because none
of the conjectures proposed appear to be satisfactory.

Rann, reading in his text:

                  'The dram of base
    Doth all the noble substance of worth out
    To his own scandal....'

gives some conjectures, without naming the authors, in a note thus:
'_Doth all, &c. oft corrupt: oft work out: eat out: By it's own
scandal._'

The first of these alterations, 'oft corrupt,' anticipates one which
Mitford published as his own, and the third, 'eat out,' is borrowed
from the author of 'the Revisal' (Heath).

Mr Grant White suggests that "the corruption lurks in a part of the
passage hitherto unsuspected, and that 'Doth' is either a misprint of
'Hath,' or has the sense of 'accomplishes.'" Mr Keightley reads,

                  'The dram of evil
    Doth all the noble substance, out o' doubt,
    To his own scandal....'

marking the sentence as incomplete.


NOTE VII.

I. 4. 61. Steevens says 'The first Folio reads--_remote_.' We have not
been able to find this reading in any copy of that edition which we
have consulted. Sir Frederic Madden has kindly collated for us the four
copies in the British Museum, all of which have 'remoued.' This is also
the reading of Capell's copy, of Malone's, and of two others to which
we have had access, and it is the reading in Mr Booth's reprint.


NOTE VIII.

I. 5. 80. 'A very learned lady,' probably Mrs Montagu, suggested to
Johnson that this line 'O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!'
should be given to Hamlet, and it is said that Garrick adopted this
suggestion when he played Hamlet. Rann appears to be the first editor
who put it in his text. Mr Verplanck and Mr Hudson have followed his
example.

In the Quarto of 1603, (Q₁), the Ghost says 'O horrible, most
horrible!' and Hamlet interrupts with 'O God!'


NOTE IX.

I. 5. 113-116. The second Quarto followed by the rest reads thus:

                    '_Enter Horatio, and Marcellus._

    _Hora._ My Lord, my Lord.

    _Mar._ Lord _Hamlet_.

    _Hora._ Heauens secure him.

    _Ham._ So be it.

    _Mar._ Illo, ho, ho, my Lord.'

The Folios have:

    '_Hor. & Mar. within._ My Lord, my Lord.

                     _Enter Horatio and Marcellus._

    _Mar._ Lord _Hamlet_.

    _Hor._ Heauen secure him.

    _Mar._ So be it.

    _Hor._ Illo, ho, ho, my Lord.'

Capell first transferred the stage direction '_Enter Horatio and
Marcellus_' to follow line 117, and added the direction '_within_' to
all the previous speeches. In this he has been followed by Steevens
(1778) and all subsequent editors. As however the first Quarto, which
was taken down probably during the representation of the play, puts the
words _Enter Horatio, and Marcellus_ opposite 'My Lord, my Lord,' it is
probable that they really entered at that place but were supposed, it
being night-time, not to be seen by Hamlet till they were close to him.

Capell followed the Quartos in assigning 'So be it' to Hamlet.


NOTE X.

I. 5. 157-160. The second Quarto followed substantially by the rest
reads thus:

    'Come hether Gentlemen,
    And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,
    Sweare by my sword
    Neuer to speak of this that you haue heard.'

The first Folio has:

    'Come hither Gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword,
    Neuer to speake of this that you have heard:
    Sweare by my Sword.'

The following Folios put a full stop after 'sword' in the second line.

Capell, taking the order of words from the Quartos, arranged as three
lines, thus:

    'Come hither, gentlemen, and lay your hands
    Again upon my sword; Swear by my sword,
    Never to speak of this that you have heard.'

The first Quarto supports the order of the words as found in the Folio.
Perhaps we might follow it and arrange the words of the Folio in three
lines ending 'hands' ... 'speak' ... 'sword.'


NOTE XI.

II. 1. 79. Theobald, who is followed by Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson,
reads 'loose' for 'foul'd,' on the authority as he says of 'the elder
Quartos.' It is not the reading of any of the first six, but of those
of 1676, 1683, 1695 and 1703. Had Capell been aware of this, he
would scarcely have designated Theobald's mistake as 'a downright
falsehood.' Theobald, at the time of writing his 'Shakespeare
Restored,' knew of no Quarto earlier than that of 1637 (_Shakespeare
Restored_, p. 70), and it is just possible that some copy of this
edition (Q₆), from which that of 1676 was printed, may have had the
reading 'loose.' We have given in the note to III. 4. 59 an instance of
different readings in two copies of Q₆.


NOTE XII.

II. 2. 111, 112. In the Quartos Polonius's comment, 'that's an ill
phrase ...,' is printed in italics like the letter, and there is some
confusion in the next line. The second, third, fourth and fifth have
'_but you shall heare: thus in her excellent white bosom, these &c._'
The sixth puts a comma after '_heare_.' In the Folios these last words
are printed in Roman type as if they were part of Polonius's comment,
thus: 'but you shall heare these in her excellent white bosome, these.'

Rowe printed: 'but you shall hear--_These to her excellent white bosom,
these_--'

The succeeding editors followed Rowe, down to Capell who restored the
word '_in_' for '_to_.' The reading and punctuation of our text was
first given substantially by Jennens, and adopted by Malone.


NOTE XIII.

II. 2. 123. In the fourth and fifth Quartos the word 'Hamlet,' in
italics, is by mistake printed not at the end of the letter but
opposite to the first line of Polonius's speech.


NOTE XIV.

II. 2. 169. The Quartos have '_Enter Hamlet_' after 'try it,' line 166,
and '_Exit King and Queene_' after the words 'both away,' line 168. The
Folios have '_Enter Hamlet, reading on a Booke_' after 'try it,' line
166, and '_Exit King & Queen_' after 'presently,' line 169. The Quartos
put commas at 'presently,' and 'leave,' reading 'Ile ... leave' as one
line; the Folios put full stops, reading 'Oh give me leave. How does my
good Lord Hamlet?' as one line.

The earlier editors down to Johnson inclusive made no change.

Capell supposed the words 'O, give me leave' to be addressed, not to
Hamlet, but to the King and Queen, whose _Exeunt_ he placed after these
words. His arrangement has been followed by all subsequent editors,
till we ventured, in the Globe edition, to recur to the old order. It
appears to us that the words 'O, give me leave,' commencing with an
exclamation, are more naturally addressed to Hamlet than to the King
and Queen, with whom Polonius had been previously conversing.

Mr Dyce transferred the entrance of Hamlet to follow the _Exeunt_ of
the King and Queen, line 169. As in the first Quarto he is made to
enter earlier, it is possible that he was in sight of the audience,
though so intent on his book as not to observe the presence of the
others.


NOTE XV.

II. 2. 564. Capell quotes 'braves' as the reading of the Quarto of
1605. His own copy has 'braines.' That in the British Museum reads
'braues.'


NOTE XVI.

III. 1. 86. In this doubtful passage we have retained the reading of
the Quartos, although the players' Quartos of 1676, 1683, 1695, 1703,
have, contrary to their custom, followed the Folios, which may possibly
indicate that 'pith' was the reading according to the stage tradition.


NOTE XVII.

III. 2. 156, 157. Jennens prints in brackets the line of the Quartos
which we have omitted, and conjectures, as Johnson had done before him,
that a line is lost either before or after it, which should rhyme to
'love.' As in the Quartos the line 'For women feare too much, even as
they love,' occurs at the top of a page, the omission is more likely
to have been caused by a line having dropped out at the foot of the
previous page. Mr Keightley marks the omission of a line after 'love.'
Malone supposes that the 'Either none' of the Quartos in line 158 was
the commencement of the lost line, which he suggests may have run as
follows:

    'Either none they feel, or an excess approve.'

Steevens proposes to retain the omitted line, reading 'lust' for
'love,' making a triplet rhyme with the preceding lines.

The Quarto probably gives us the author's first thought, incomplete, as
well as the lines which he finally adopted, as they stand in the Folio.
The thought will hardly bear to be expanded over four lines.


NOTE XVIII.

III. 2. 329. Mason conjectured that the words 'To withdraw with you'
were spoken to the players whom Hamlet wished to get rid of, and
proposed to read 'So, withdraw you,' or 'So withdraw, will you?' Malone
adds the stage direction 'Taking Guil. aside.' Steevens supposes that
the words 'To ... you' "may refer to some gesture which Guildenstern
had used, and which, at first was interpreted by Hamlet into a
signal for him to attend the speaker into another room. 'To withdraw
with you?' (says he) 'Is that your meaning?'" Mr Staunton, agreeing
substantially with Mason, proposes to read 'So,--[_taking a recorder_]
withdraw with you.' He adds that the disputed words may have been
intended to mark the departure of the players. Jackson (1819) proposed
the same reading and explanation, adding a stage direction, '_To the
Players, who exit._'

If the reading and punctuation given in our text be right, the words
seem to be addressed to Guildenstern. Mr Knight, however, suggests that
'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have intimated, by some signal, that they
wish to speak with Hamlet in private.'


NOTE XIX.

III. 2. 366--371. In this passage we have followed the distribution of
the Folios. In the Quartos it stands thus:

    'They foole me to the top of my bent, I will come by and by,
    Leaue me friends.
    I will, say so. By and by is easily said,
    'Tis now &c.'

In the Quarto of 1676 the words 'I will come ... said' are marked in
inverted commas to indicate that they were omitted by the actors. Pope
following the arrangement of the Quartos, reading 'I will say so' with
the Quarto of 1676.


NOTE XX.

III. 4. 4. We have adopted Hanmer's correction 'sconce' for 'silence'
because in the corresponding passage of the first Quarto Polonius says:
'I'le shrowde my selfe behinde the Arras.' The Quartos of 1676, 1683,
1695 and 1703 give 'I'll here conceal my self.'

In the Quarto of 1603 there is also a trace of the following speech of
Hamlet, omitted in the subsequent Quartos but given in the Folios.


NOTE XXI.

III. 4. 51, 52. This speech is properly given to the Queen in the
Folios, but is printed as prose. The second Quarto has:

    '_Quee._ Ay me, what act?

    _Ham._ That roares so low'd, and thunders in the Index,
    Looke heere &c.'

This is followed by the subsequent Quartos, except the sixth, which has
a colon at 'Index.' Warburton adopts the distribution of the Quartos,
but alters the second line thus:

    '_Ham._  That roars so loud, it thunders to the Indies.'


NOTE XXII.

III. 4. 71. The reading 'stoop' for 'step' is found in manuscript in
the margin of a copy of the Quarto of 1637, which has been kindly lent
us by Dr Ingleby. The other readings in this play referred to as 'Anon.
conj. MS.' or 'Anon. MS.' are from the same source.


NOTE XXIII.

IV. 1. 40--44. In the second and third Quartos these lines stand
literatim as follows:

    'And whats vntimely doone,
    Whose whisper ore the worlds dyameter,
    As leuell as the Cannon to his blanck,
    Transports his poysned shot, may misse our Name,
    And hit the woundlesse ayre, ô come away,
    My soule &c.'

The later Quartos, including those of 1676, 1683, 1695, and 1703,
spelling apart, have the same reading.

In the first Folio, followed substantially by the rest, we find only
these words:

    'And what's vntimely done. Oh come away,
    My soule &c.'

Rowe, Pope, Hanmer and Warburton followed the Folios.

Theobald first adopted the text of the Quartos. In his _Shakespeare
Restored_, p. 108, he had suggested 'Happily, slander,' or 'Happily,
rumour;' in his edition he supplied the blank thus:

    'And what's untimely done. For, haply, Slander
    (Whose whisper &c.'

Hanmer, in his copy of Theobald's edition, erased the passage with a
pen.

Johnson, and Steevens in his editions of 1773, 1778 and 1785, followed
Theobald.

Capell filled the hiatus by '_So_, haply, slander,' and was followed
by Steevens (1793) and most modern editors. Mason seems not to have
consulted Capell's edition, for in 1788 he puts forward this reading as
a conjecture of his own.

Malone (1790) read: 'So viperous slander.'

Mr Staunton proposes 'Thus calumny,' but in his text follows Capell.

'Malice' or 'Envy,' in the sense in which it is often used by
Shakespeare, would suit the passage as well as 'Slander.'


NOTE XXIV.

IV. 2. 1--3. The second and third Quartos begin the scene thus:

    '_Ham._ Safely stowd, but soft, what noyse, who calls on _Hamlet?_'

The fourth and fifth have 'softly' for 'soft.'

The Folios have:

    '_Ham._ Safely stowed.

    _Gentlemen within._ _Hamlet_, Lord _Hamlet_.

    _Ham._ What noise? Who cals on _Hamlet_?'

In the players' Quarto of 1676, and the following editions, which
otherwise adhere to the reading of the old Quartos, the words 'but
soft' are omitted. They omit also 'on'.

Capell gives:

    'HAM.---- Safely stow'd. But, soft;

    ROS. &c. [_within._] _Hamlet!_ lord _Hamlet!_

    HAM. What noise? who calls on _Hamlet_? O, here they come.'

The arrangement adopted in our text was first given by Malone.


NOTE XXV.

IV. 5. 14--16. The Quartos have:

    '_Hora._ Twere good she were spoken with, for shee may strew
    Dangerous coniectures in ill breeding mindes,
    Let her come in.'

The Folios,

    '_Qu._ 'Twere good she were spoken with,
    For she may strew dangerous coniectures
    In ill breeding minds. Let her come in.'

Rowe followed the Folios; Pope, Theobald, Warburton and Capell, the
Quartos. Hanmer continues the lines ''Twere good ... minds' to the
Gentleman who had spoken the previous lines, and gives 'Let her come
in &c.' to the Queen. Johnson follows Hanmer's distribution of the
speeches, but substitutes 'Hor.' for 'Gent.' in lines 2 and 4; the
arrangement proposed by Blackstone. Steevens (1773) assigned the speech
''Twere good ... spilt' (14--20) to Horatio, but restored it to the
Queen in his next edition. Mr Grant White follows the Folios in giving
the whole Speech to the Queen, but marks ''Twere good ... minds' as
spoken aside, and 'Let ... in' 'To Hor.'


NOTE XXVI.

IV. 5. 148. In the Quartos the passage is thus printed:

                                                     '_A noyse within._

                            _Enter Ophelia._

    _Laer._ Let her come in.
    How now, what noyse is that?'

In the Folios:

                                    '_A noise within. Let her come in._

                            _Enter Ophelia._

    _Laer._ How now? what noise is that?'

Rowe followed the Folios, Pope the Quartos, reading 'Let ... that?'
as one line. Theobald first transferred the stage direction, _Enter
Ophelia_, to follow the first line of Laertes's speech.


NOTE XXVII.

IV. 5. 163. Capell was the first to print these words as not forming
part of the song. In the Folios they are printed like the former
lines in italics. As there is no change of type in the Quartos, it is
impossible to say on which side their authority is. There is a comma
after 'teare' (or 'tear') in all the Quartos and Folios, except the
sixth Quarto, which has a full stop.


NOTE XXVIII.

IV. 5. 166. Ophelia's speech, or song, is printed as three lines in the
Quarto, thus:

    '_Oph._ You must sing a downe a downe,
    And you call him a downe a. O how the wheele becomes it,
    It is the false Steward that stole his Maisters daughter.'

It is printed as prose in the Folios; beginning, 'You must sing downe
a-downe, &c.' There is no indication that any part was meant to be sung.

Johnson first printed 'You must sing ... call him a-down-a' in italics,
as a snatch of song. Steevens (1778) put 'Down a down, as you call
him a-down-a' in italics, a reading suggested by Capell's text, where
'Down' begins with a capital letter. The late Mr John Taylor, in a
copy of the second Variorum edition (1813) now in the Library of
Trinity College, Cambridge, has made the following note. "Ophelia
gives the song without the Burthen first, and then she instructs them
'You must sing _a-down a-down_, and you (speaking to another) call him
_a-down-a_."


NOTE XXIX.

IV. 5. 195. In the Folios Ophelia's song is printed in Italics, and the
words 'And ... you' in Roman type, 'God buy ye' being in a separate
line. In the second and third Quartos the whole is printed in Roman
type, and ends thus:

    'God a mercy on his soule, and of all Christians soules,
    God buy you.'

We have indicated in the foot-note how the later Quartos differ from
the earlier.


NOTE XXX.

IV. 7. 139. Pope in his second edition says that 'one edition has it,
_embaited_ or envenomed.' We have not been able to find this reading
in any copy, but Theobald (_Shakespeare Restored_, p. 119) conjectured
'imbaited.' As this conjecture is not mentioned in his edition, we have
here, as in other cases, recorded it as 'withdrawn.'


NOTE XXXI.

V. 1. 57, 58. Mr Collier in his first edition conjectured that
'Yaughan' might be 'a mis-spelt stage direction to inform the player
that he was to _yawn_ at this point.' Mr Staunton says, "Whether by
'Yaughan' a man or place is meant, or whether the word is a corruption,
we are not qualified to determine." Mr Grant White says, "I suspect
that 'Yaughan' is a misprint for 'Tavern.' But some local allusion
understood at the day may lurk under it."


NOTE XXXII.

V. 2. 205, 206. The reading in the text is taken partly from the Folios
and partly from the Quartos, altering however the punctuation. The
second Quarto, followed substantially by the rest, has as follows:

    'The readines is all, since no man of ought he leaues, knowes what
    ist to leaue betimes, let be.'

The first Folio, followed, except in spelling, by the rest, has:

    _'The readinesse is all, since no man ha's ought of what he leaues.
    What is't to leaue betimes?'_

The Quartos of 1676, 1683, 1695 and 1703 have:

    'The readiness is all, since no man of ought he leaves knows what
    'tis to leave betimes, let be.'

Rowe, Pope and Theobald followed the Folios.

Hanmer:

    'The readiness is all. Since no man owes aught of what he leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes?'

Warburton:

    'The readiness is all. Since no man, of ought he leaves, knows,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.'

Johnson:

    'The readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
    leaves, what is't to leave betimes?'

Steevens (1773, 1778, 1785) and Rann adopt the reading of Johnson,
adding the words 'Let be.'

Warburton's reading was followed by Capell, Malone, Steevens (1793),
the Editors of the three _Variorum Shakespeares_, 1803, 1813, 1821,
Singer, Harness and Mr Collier.

Caldecott first adopted the reading given in our text. Mr Grant White
follows him.

Becket would substitute 'has thought' for 'has aught.'

Mr Keightley prints thus, marking the sentence as unfinished:

    'The readiness is all. Since no man, of aught he leaves, knows
    what it is to leave betimes.... Let be.'


NOTE XXXIII.

V. 2. 290. Mr Staunton says, "The exclamation 'Ho!' meaning _stop_,
should perhaps be addressed to the combatants, and not, as it is always
printed, to those who are to raise the Queen."

    2. In the same figure like the King that's dead,                  35

    _Mar._  Thou art a scholler, speake to it _Horatio_.

    2. Lookes it not like the king?

    _Hor._ Most like, it horrors mee with feare and wonder.

    2. It would be spoke to.

    _Mar._ Question it _Horatio_.                                     40

    _Hor._ What art thou that thus vsurps the state, in
    Which the Maiestie of buried _Denmarke_ did sometimes
    Walke? By heauen I charge thee speake.

    _Mar._ It is offended.      _exit Ghost._

    2. See, it stalkes away.                                          45

    _Hor._ Stay, speake, speake, by heauen I charge thee
    speake.

    _Mar._ Tis gone and makes no answer.

    2. How now _Horatio_, you tremble and looke pale,
    Is not this something more than fantasie?                         50
    What thinke you on't?

    _Hor._ Afore my God, I might not this beleeue, without
    the sensible and true auouch of my owne eyes.

    _Mar._ Is it not like the King?

    _Hor._ As thou art to thy selfe,                                  55
    Such was the very armor he had on,
    When he the ambitious _Norway_ combated.
    So frownd he once, when in an angry parle
    He smot the sleaded pollax on the yce,
    Tis strange.                                                      60

    _Mar._ Thus twice before, and iump at this dead hower,
    With Marshall stalke he passed through our watch.

    _Hor._ In what particular to worke, I know not,
    But in the thought and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to the state.                    65

    _Mar._ Good, now sit downe, and tell me he that knowes
    Why this same strikt and most obseruant watch,
    So nightly toyles the subiect of the land,
    And why such dayly cost of brazen Cannon
    And forraine marte, for implements of warre,                      70
    Why such impresse of ship-writes, whose sore taske
    Does not diuide the sunday from the weeke:
    What might be toward that this sweaty march
    Doth make the night ioynt labourer with the day,
    Who is't that can informe me?                                     75

    _Hor._ Mary that can I, at least the whisper goes so,
    Our late King, who as you know was by Forten-Brasse
    of _Norway_,
    Thereto prickt on by a most emulous cause, dared to
    The combate, in which our valiant _Hamlet_,                       80
    For so this side of our knowne world esteemed him,
    Did slay this Fortenbrasse,
    Who by a seale compact well ratified, by law
    And heraldrie, did forfeit with his life all those
    His lands which he stoode seazed of by the conqueror,             85
    Against the which a moity competent,
    Was gaged by our King:
    Now sir, yong Fortenbrasse,
    Of inapproued mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of _Norway_ here and there,                    90
    Sharkt vp a sight of lawlesse Resolutes
    For food and diet to some enterprise,
    That hath a stomacke in't: and this (I take it) is the
    Chiefe head and ground of this our watch.

                           _Enter the Ghost._

    But loe, behold, see where it comes againe,                       95
    Ile crosse it, though it blast me: stay illusion,
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may doe ease to thee, and grace to mee,
    Speake to mee.
    If thou art priuy to thy countries fate,                         100
    Which happly foreknowing may preuent, O speake to me,
    Or if thou hast extorted in thy life,
    Or hoorded treasure in the wombe of earth,
    For which they say you Spirites oft walke in death, speake
    to me, stay and speake, speake, stoppe it _Marcellus_.           105

    2. Tis heere.        _exit Ghost._

    _Hor._ Tis heere.

    _Marc._ Tis gone, O we doe it wrong, being so maiesticall,
    to offer it the shew of violence,
    For it is as the ayre invelmorable,                              110
    And our vaine blowes malitious mockery.

    2. It was about to speake when the Cocke crew.

    _Hor._ And then it faded like a guilty thing,
    Vpon a fearefull summons: I haue heard
    The Cocke, that is the trumpet to the morning,                   115
    Doth with his earely and shrill crowing throate,
    Awake the god of day, and at his sound,
    Whether in earth or ayre, in sea or fire,
    The strauagant and erring spirite hies
    To his confines, and of the trueth heereof                       120
    This present obiect made probation.

    _Marc._ It faded on the crowing of the Cocke,
    Some say, that euer gainst that season comes,
    Wherein our Sauiours birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long,                      125
    And then they say, no spirite dare walke abroade,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planet frikes,
    No Fairie takes, nor Witch hath powre to charme,
    So gratious, and so hallowed is that time.

    _Hor._ So haue I heard, and doe in parte beleeue it:             130
    But see the Sunne in russet mantle clad,
    Walkes ore the deaw of yon his mountaine top,
    Breake we our watch vp, and by my aduise,
    Let vs impart what wee haue seene to night
    Vnto yong _Hamlet_: for vpon my life                             135
    This Spirite dumbe to vs will speake to him:
    Do you consent, wee shall acquaint him with it,
    As needefull in our loue, fitting our duetie?

    _Marc._ Lets doo't I pray, and I this morning know,
    Where we shall finde him most conueniently.                      140

            _Enter King, Queene, Hamlet, Leartes, Corambis,
               and the two Ambassadors, with Attendants._


[Sidenote: [SC. II.]]

    _King_ Lordes, we here haue writ to _Fortenbrasse_,
    Nephew to olde _Norway_, who impudent
    And bed-rid, scarcely heares of this his
    Nephews purpose: and Wee heere dispatch
    Yong good _Cornelia_, and you _Voltemar_                           5
    For bearers of these greetings to olde
    _Norway_, giuing to you no further personall power
    To businesse with the King,
    Then those related articles do shew:
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your dutie.                  10

    _Gent._ In this and all things will wee shew our dutie.

    _King._ Wee doubt nothing, hartily farewel:
    And now _Leartes_ what's the newes with you?[2422]
    You said you had a sute what i'st _Leartes_?

    _Lea._ My gratious Lord, your fauorable licence,                  15
    Now that the funerall rites are all performed,
    I may haue leaue to go againe to _France_,
    For though the fauour of your grace might stay mee,
    Yet something is there whispers in my hart,
    Which makes my minde and spirits bend all for _France_.           20

    _King_ Haue you your fathers leaue, _Leartes_?

    _Cor._ He hath, my lord, wrung from me a forced graunt,
    And I beseech you grant your Highnesse leaue.

    _King_ With all our heart, _Leartes_ fare thee well.

    _Lear._ I in all loue and dutie take my leaue.                    25

    _King._ And now princely Sonne _Hamlet_,         _Exit._
    What meanes these sad and melancholy moodes?
    For your intent going to _Wittenberg_,
    Wee hold it most vnmeet and vnconuenient,
    Being the Ioy and halfe heart of your mother.                     30
    Therefore let mee intreat you stay in Court,
    All _Denmarkes_ hope our coosin and dearest Sonne.

    _Ham._ My lord, ti's not the sable sute I weare:
    No nor the teares that still stand in my eyes,
    Nor the distracted hauiour in the visage,                         35
    Nor all together mixt with outward semblance,
    Is equall to the sorrow of my heart,
    Him haue I lost I must of force forgoe,
    These but the ornaments and sutes of woe.

    _King_ This shewes a louing care in you, Sonne _Hamlet_,          40
    But you must thinke your father lost a father,
    That father dead, lost his, and so shalbe vntill the
    Generall ending. Therefore cease laments,
    It is a fault gainst heauen, fault gainst the dead,
    A fault gainst nature, and in reasons                             45
    Common course most certaine,
    None liues on earth, but hee is borne to die.

    _Que._ Let not thy mother loose her praiers _Hamlet_,
    Stay here with vs, go not to _Wittenberg_.

    _Ham._ I shall in all my best obay you madam.                     50

    _King_ Spoke like a kinde and a most louing Sonne,
    And there's no health the King shall drinke to day,
    But the great Canon to the clowdes shall tell
    The rowse the King shall drinke vnto Prince _Hamlet_.

                        _Exeunt all but Hamlet._

    _Ham._ O that this too much grieu'd and sallied flesh             55
    Would melt to nothing, or that the vniuersall
    Globe of heauen would turne al to a Chaos!
    O God within two moneths; no not two: maried,[2423]
    Mine vncle: O let me not thinke of it,
    My fathers brother: but no more like
    My father, then I to _Hercules_.
    Within two months, ere yet the salt of most
    Vnrighteous teates had left their flushing
    In her galled eyes: she married, O God, a beast
    Deuoyd of reason would not haue made                              65
    Such speede: Frailtie, thy name is Woman,
    Why she would hang on him, as if increase
    Of appetite had growne by what it looked on.
    O wicked wicked speede, to make such
    Dexteritie to incestuous sheetes,                                 70
    Ere yet the shooes were olde,
    The which she followed my dead fathers corse
    Like _Nyobe_, all teares: married, well it is not,
    Nor it cannot come to good:
    But breake my heart, for I must holde my tongue.                  75

                    _Enter_ Horatio _and_ Marcellus.

    _Hor._ Health to your Lordship.

    _Ham._ I am very glad to see you, (Horatio) or I much
    forget my selfe.

    _Hor._ The same my Lord, and your poore seruant euer.

    _Ham._ O my good friend, I change that name with you:             80
    but what make you from _Wittenberg_ _Horatio_?
    _Marcellus._

    _Marc._ My good Lord.

    _Ham._ I am very glad to see you, good euen sirs:
    But what is your affaire in _Elsenoure_?                          85
    Weele teach you to drinke deepe ere you depart.

    _Hor._ A trowant disposition, my good Lord.

    _Ham._ Nor shall you make mee truster
    Of your owne report against your selfe:
    Sir, I know you are no trowant:                                   90
    But what is your affaire in _Elsenoure_?

    _Hor._ My good Lord, I came to see your fathers funerall.

    _Ham._ O I pre thee do not mocke mee fellow studient,
    I thinke it was to see my mothers wedding.

    _Hor._ Indeede my Lord, it followed hard vpon.                    95

    _Ham._ Thrift, thrift, _Horatio_, the funerall bak't meates
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables,
    Would I had met my deerest foe in heauen
    Ere euer I had seene that day _Horatio_;
    O my father, my father, me thinks I see my father,               100

    _Hor._ Where my Lord?

    _Ham._ Why, in my mindes eye _Horatio_.

    _Hor._ I saw him once, he was a gallant King.

    _Ham._ He was a man, take him for all in all,
    I shall not looke vpon his like againe.

    _Hor._ My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight,

    _Ham._ Saw, who?

    _Hor._ My Lord, the King your father.

    _Ham._ Ha, ha, the King my father ke you.

    _Hor._ Ceasen your admiration for a while                        110
    With an attentiue eare, till I may deliuer,
    Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen
    This wonder to you.

    _Ham._ For Gods loue let me heare it.

    _Hor._ Two nights together had these Gentlemen,                  115
    _Marcellus_ and _Bernardo_, on their watch,
    In the dead vast and middle of the night.
    Beene thus incountered by a figure like your father,
    Armed to poynt, exactly _Capapea_
    Appeeres before them thrise, he walkes                           120
    Before their weake and feare oppressed eies.
    Within his tronchions length,
    While they distilled almost to gelly.
    With the act of feare stands dumbe,
    And speake not to him: this to mee                               125
    In dreadfull secresie impart they did.
    And I with them the third night kept the watch,
    Where as they had deliuered forme of the thing.
    Each part made true and good,
    The Apparition comes: I knew your father,                        130
    These handes are not more like.

    _Ham._ Tis very strange.

    _Hor._ As I do liue, my honord lord, tis true,
    And wee did thinke it right done,
    In our dutie to let you know it.                                 135

    _Ham._ Where was this?

    _Mar._ My Lord, vpon the platforme where we watched.

    _Ham._ Did you not speake to it?

    _Hor._ My Lord we did, but answere made it none,
    Yet once me thought it was about to speake,                      140
    And lifted vp his head to motion,
    Like as he would speake, but euen then
    The morning cocke crew lowd, and in all haste,
    It shruncke in haste away, and vanished
    Our sight.                                                       145

    _Ham._ Indeed, indeed sirs, but this troubles me:
    Hold you the watch to night?

    _All_ We do my Lord.

    _Ham._ Armed say ye?

    _All_ Armed my good Lord.                                        150

    _Ham._ From top to toe?

    _All._ My good Lord, from head to foote.

    _Ham._ Why then saw you not his face?

    _Hor._ O yes my Lord, he wore his beuer vp.

    _Ham._ How look't he, frowningly?                                155

    _Hor._ A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

    _Ham._ Pale, or red?

    _Hor._ Nay, verie pal

    _Ham._ And fixt his eies vpon you.

    _Hor._ Most constantly.                                          160

    _Ham._ I would I had beene there.

    _Hor._ It would a much amazed you.

    _Ham._ Yea very like, very like, staid it long?

    _Hor._ While one with moderate pace
    Might tell a hundred.                                            165

    _Mar._ O longer, longer.

    _Ham._ His beard was grisleld, no.

    _Hor._ It was as I haue seene it in his life,
    A sable siluer.

    _Ham._ I wil watch to night, perchance t'wil walke againe.       170

    _Hor._ I warrant it will.

    _Ham._ If it assume my noble fathers person,
    Ile speake to it, if hell it selfe should gape,
    And bid me hold my peace, Gentlemen,
    If you haue hither consealed this sight,                         175
    Let it be tenible in your silence still,
    And whatsoeuer else shall chance to night,
    Giue it an vnderstanding, but no tongue,
    I will requit your loues, so fare you well,
    Vpon the platforme, twixt eleuen and twelue,                     180
    Ile visit you.

    _All._ Our duties to your honor.        _exeunt._

    _Ham._ O your loues, your loues, as mine to you,
    Farewell, my fathers spirit in Armes,
    Well, all's not well. I doubt some foule play,                   185
    Would the night were come,
    Till then, sit still my soule, foule deeds will rise
    Though all the world orewhelme them to mens eies.        _Exit._

    _Ofel._ It is already lock't within my hart,                      45
    And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it.

    _Cor._ What i'st _Ofelia_ he hath saide to you?

    _Ofel._ Somthing touching the prince _Hamlet_.

    _Cor._ Mary wel thought on, t'is giuen me to vnderstand,
    That you haue bin too prodigall of your maiden presence           50
    Vnto Prince Hamlet, if it be so,
    As so tis giuen to mee, and that in waie of caution
    I must tell you; you do not vnderstand your selfe
    So well as befits my honor, and your credite.

    _Ofel._ My lord, he hath made many tenders of his loue            55
    to me.

    _Cor._ Tenders, I, I, tenders you may call them.

    _Ofel._ And withall, such earnest vowes.

    _Cor._ Springes to catch woodcocks,
    What, do not I know when the blood doth burne,                    60
    How prodigall the tongue lends the heart vowes,
    In briefe, be more scanter of your maiden presence,
    Or tendring thus you'l tender mee a foole.

    _Ofel._ I shall obay my lord in all I may.

    _Cor._ _Ofelia_, receiue none of his letters,                     65
    "For louers lines are snares to intrap the heart;
    "Refuse his tokens, both of them are keyes

               _Enter_ Hamlet, Horatio, _and_ Marcellus.

    _Ham._ The ayre bites shrewd; it is an eager and
    An nipping winde, what houre i'st?

    _Hor._ I think it lacks of twelue.           _Sound Trumpets._

    _Mar._ No, t'is strucke.

    _Hor._ Indeed I heard it not, what doth this mean my lord?         5

    _Ham._ O the king doth wake to night, & takes his rowse,
    Keepe wassel, and the swaggering vp-spring reeles,
    And as he dreames, his draughts of renish downe,
    The kettle, drumme, and trumpet, thus bray out,
    The triumphes of his pledge.                                      10

    _Hor._ Is it a custome here?

    _Ham._ I mary i'st and though I am
    Natiue here, and to the maner borne,
    It is a custome, more honourd in the breach,
    Then in the obseruance.                                           15

    _Hor._ Looke my Lord, it comes.

    _Ham._ Angels and Ministers of grace defend vs,
    Be thou a spirite of health, or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee ayres from heauen, or blasts from hell:
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,                              20
    Thou commest in such questionable shape,
    That I will speake to thee,
    Ile call thee _Hamlet_, King, Father, Royall Dane,

    But say why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death                   25
    Haue burst their ceremonies: why thy Sepulcher,
    In which wee saw thee quietly interr'd.
    Hath burst his ponderous and marble Iawes,
    To cast thee vp againe: what may this meane,
    That thou, dead corse, againe in compleate steele,                30
    Reuissets thus the glimses of the Moone,
    Making night hideous, and we fooles of nature,
    So horridely to shake our disposition,
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our soules?
    Say, speake, wherefore, what may this meane?                      35

    _Hor._ It beckons you, as though it had something
    To impart to you alone.

    _Mar._ Looke with what courteous action
    It waues you to a more remoued ground,
    But do not go with it.                                            40

    _Hor._ No, by no meanes my Lord.

    _Ham._ It will not speake, then will I follow it.

    _Hor._ What if it tempt you toward the flood my Lord.
    That beckles ore his bace, into the sea,
    And there assume some other horrible shape,                       45
    Which might depriue your soueraigntie of reason,
    And driue you into madnesse: thinke of it.

    _Ham._ Still am I called, go on, ile follow thee.

    _Hor._ My Lord, you shall not go.

    _Ham._ Why what should be the feare?                              50
    I do not set my life at a pinnes fee,
    And for my soule, what can it do to that?
    Being a thing immortall, like it selfe,
    Go on, ile follow thee.

    _Mar._ My Lord be rulde, you shall not goe.                       55

    _Ham._ My fate cries out, and makes each pety Artiue
    As hardy as the Nemeon Lyons nerue,
    Still am I cald, vnhand me gentlemen;
    By heauen ile make a ghost of him that lets me,
    Away I say, go on, ile follow thee.                               60

    _Hor._ He waxeth desperate with imagination.

    _Mar._ Something is rotten in the state of _Denmarke_.

    _Hor._ Haue after; to what issue will this sort?

    _Mar._ Lets follow, tis not fit thus to obey him.        _exit._

                       _Enter Ghost and Hamlet._

    _Ham._ Ile go no farther, whither wilt thou leade me?             65

    _Ghost_ Marke me.

    _Ham._ I will.

    _Ghost_ I am thy fathers spirit, doomd for a time
    To walke the night, and all the day
    Confinde in flaming fire,                                         70
    Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature
    Arepurged and burnt away.

    _Ham._ Alas poore Ghost.

    _Ghost_ Nay pitty me not, but to my vnfolding
    Lend thy listning eare, but that I am forbid                      75
    To tell the secrets of my prison house
    I would a tale vnfold, whose lightest word
    Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy yong blood,
    Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,                           80
    And each particular haire to stand on end
    Like quils vpon the fretfull Porpentine,
    But this same blazon must not be, to eares of flesh and blood
    Hamlet, if euer thou didst thy deere father loue.

    _Ham._ O God.                                                     85

    _Gho._ Reuenge his foule, and most vnnaturall murder:

    _Ham._ Murder.

    _Ghost_ Yea, murder in the highest degree,
    As in the least tis bad,
    But mine most foule, beastly, and vnnaturall.                     90

    _Ham._ Haste me to knowe it, that with wings as swift as
    meditation, or the thought of it, may sweepe to my reuenge.

    _Ghost_ O I finde thee apt, and duller shouldst thou be
    Then the fat weede which rootes it selfe in ease
    On _Lethe_ wharffe: briefe let me be.                             95
    Tis giuen out, that sleeping in my orchard,
    A Serpent stung me; so the whole eare of _Denmarke_
    Is with a forged Prosses of my death rankely abusde:
    But know thou noble Youth: he that did sting
    Thy fathers heart, now weares his Crowne.                        100

    _Ham._ O my prophetike soule, my vncle! my vncle!

    _Ghost_ Yea he, that incestuous wretch, wonne to his will with gifts,
    O wicked will, and gifts! that haue the power
    So to seduce my most seeming vertuous Queene,
    But vertne, as it neuer will be moued,                           105
    Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of heauen,
    So Lust, though to a radiant angle linckt,
    Would fate it selfe from a celestiall bedde,
    And prey on garbage: but soft, me thinkes
    I sent the mornings ayre, briefe let me be,                      110
    Sleeping within my Orchard, my custome alwayes
    In the after noone, vpon my secure houre
    Thy vncle came, with iuyce of Hebona
    In a viall, and through the porches of my eares
    Did powre the leaprous distilment, whose effect                  115
    Hold such an enmitie with blood of man,
    That swift as quickesiluer, it posteth through
    The naturall gates and allies of the body,
    And turnes the thinne and wholesome blood
    Like eager dropings into milke.                                  120
    And all my smoothe body, barked, and tetterd ouer.
    Thus was I sleeping by a brothers hand
    Of Crowne, of Queene, of life, of dignitie
    At once depriued, no reckoning made of,
    But sent vnto my graue,                                          125
    With all my accompts and sinnes vpon my head,
    O horrible, most horrible!

    _Ham._ O God!

    _Ghost_ If thou hast nature in thee, beare it not,
    But howsoeuer, let not thy heart                                 130
    Conspire against thy mother aught,
    Leaue her to heauen,
    And to the burthen that her conscience beares.
    I must be gone, the Glo-worme shewes the Martin
    To be neere, and gin's to pale his vneffectuall fire:            135
    Hamlet adue, adue, adue: remember me.                        [_Exit_

    _Ham._ O all you hoste of heauen! O earth, what else?
    And shall I couple hell; remember thee?
    Yes thou poore Ghost; from the tables
    Of my memorie, ile wipe away all sawes of Bookes,                140
    All triuiall fond conceites
    That euer youth, or else obseruance noted,
    And thy remembrance, all alone shall sit.
    Yes, yes, by heauen, a damnd pernitious villaine,
    Murderons, bawdy, smiling damned villaine,                       145
    (My tables) meet it is I set it downe,
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villayne;
    At least I am sure, it may be so in _Denmarke_.
    So vncle, there you are, there you are.
    Now to the words; it is adue adue: remember me,                  150

    _Ham._ No not I, you'l reueale it.

    _Hor._ Not I my Lord by heauen.

    _Mar._ Nor I my Lord.

    _Ham._ How say you then? would hart of man
    Once thinke it? but you'l be secret.                             165

    _Both._ I by heauen, my lord.

    _Ham._ There's neuer a villaine dwelling in all _Denmarke_,
    But hee's an arrant knaue.

    _Hor._ There need no Ghost come from the graue to tell
    you this.                                                        170

    _Ham._ Right, you are in the right, and therefore
    I holde it meet without more circumstance at all,
    Wee shake hands and part; you as your busines
    And desiers shall leade you: for looke you,
    Euery man hath busines, and desires, such                        175

    _Hor._ These are but wild and wherling words, my Lord.

    _Ham._ I am sory they offend you; hartely, yes faith hartily.

    _Hor._ Ther's no offence my Lord.

    _Ham._ Yes by Saint _Patrike_ but there is _Horatio_,            180
    And much offence too, touching this vision,
    It is an honest ghost, that let mee tell you,
    For your desires to know what is betweene vs,

    Come hither Gentlemen, and lay your handes
    Againe vpon this sword, neuer to speake
    Of that which you haue seene, sweare by my sword.                205

    _Ghost_ Sweare.

    _Ham._ Well said old Mole, can'st worke in the earth?
    so fast, a worthy Pioner, once more remoue.

    _Hor._ Day and night, but this is wondrous strange.

    _Ham._ And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome,              210
    There are more things in heauen and earth _Horatio_,
    Then are Dream't of, in your philosophie,

    _Ghost._ sweare.                                                 225

    _Ham._ Rest, rest, perturbed spirit: so gentlemen,
    In all my loue I do commend mee to you,
    And what so poore a man as _Hamlet_ may,
    To pleasure you, God willing shall not want,
    Nay come lett's go together,                                     230

    Though wilde a while, yet more true to thy loue.        _exeunt._


[Sidenote: [SC. VI.]]

         _Enter King and Queene, Rossencraft, and Gilderstone._

    _King_ Right noble friends, that our deere cosin Hamlet
    Hath lost the very heart of all his sence,
    It is most right, and we most sory for him:
    Therefore we doe desire, euen as you tender
    Our care to him, and our great loue to you,                        5
    That you will labour but to wring from him
    The cause and ground of his distemperancie.
    Doe this, the king of _Denmarke_ shal be thankefull.

    _Ros._ My Lord, whatsoeuer lies within our power
    Your maiestie may more commaund in wordes                         10
    Then vse perswasions to your liege men, bound
    By loue, by duetie, and obedience.

    _Guil._ What we may doe for both your Maiesties
    To know the griefe troubles the Prince your sonne,
    We will indeuour all the best we may,                             15
    So in all duetie doe we take our leaue.

    _King_ Thankes Guilderstone, and gentle Rossencraft.

    _Que._ Thankes Rossencraft, and gentle Gilderstone.

                      _Enter Corambis and Ofelia._

    _Cor._ My Lord, the Ambassadors are ioyfully
    Return'd from _Norway_.                                           20

    _King_ Thou still hast beene the father of good news.

    _Cor._ Haue I my Lord? I assure your grace,
    I holde my duetie as I holde my life,
    Both to my God, and to my soueraigne King:
    And I beleeue, or else this braine of mine                        25
    Hunts not the traine of policie so well
    As it had wont to doe, but I haue found
    The very depth of Hamlets lunacie.

    _Queene_ God graunt he hath.

                        _Enter the Ambassadors._

    _King_ Now _Voltemar_, what from our brother _Norway_?            30

    _Volt._ Most faire returnes of greetings and desires,
    Vpon our first he sent forth to suppresse
    His nephews leuies, which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation gainst the Polacke:
    But better look't into, he truely found                           35
    It was against your Highnesse, whereat grieued,
    That so his sickenesse, age, and impotence,
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On _Fortenbrasse_, which he in briefe obays,
    Receiues rebuke from _Norway_: and in fine,                       40
    Makes vow before his vncle, neuer more
    To giue the assay of Armes against your Maiestie,
    Whereon olde _Norway_ ouercome with ioy,
    Giues him three thousand crownes in annuall fee,
    And his Commission to employ those souldiers,                     45
    So leuied as before, against the Polacke,
    With an intreaty heerein further shewne,
    That it would please you to giue quiet passe
    Through your dominions, for that enterprise
    On such regardes of safety and allowances                         50
    As therein are set downe.

    _King_ It likes vs well, and at fit time and leasure
    Weele reade and answere these his Articles,
    Meane time we thanke you for your well
    Tooke labour: go to your rest, at night weele feast togither:     55
    Right welcome home.             _exeunt Ambassadors._

    _Cor._ This busines is very well dispatched.
    Now my Lord, touching the yong Prince Hamlet,
    Certaine it is that hee is madde: mad let vs grant him then:
    Now to know the cause of this effect,                             60
    Or else to say the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defectiue comes by cause.

    _Queene_ Good my Lord be briefe.

    _Cor._ Madam I will: my Lord, I haue a daughter,
    Haue while shee's mine: for that we thinke                        65
    Is surest, we often loose: now to the Prince.
    My lord, but note this letter,
    The which my daughter in obedience
    Deliuer'd to my handes.

    _King_ Reade it my Lord.                                          70

    _Cor._ Marke my Lord.
    Doubt that in earth is fire,
    Doubt that the starres doe moue,
    Doubt trueth to be a liar,
    But doe not doubt I loue.                                         75
    To the beautifull _Ofelia_:
    Thine euer the most vnhappy Prince _Hamlet_.
    My Lord, what doe you thinke of me?
    I, or what might you thinke when I sawe this?

    _King_ As of a true friend and a most louing subiect.             80

    _Cor._ I would be glad to prooue so.
    Now when I saw this letter, thus I bespake my maiden:
    Lord _Hamlet_ is a Prince out of your starre,
    And one that is vnequall for your loue:
    Therefore I did commaund her refuse his letters,                  85
    Deny his tokens, and to absent her selfe.
    Shee as my childe obediently obey'd me.
    Now since which time, seeing his loue thus cross'd,
    Which I tooke to be idle, and but sport,
    He straitway grew into a melancholy,                              90
    From that vnto a fast, then vnto distraction,
    Then into a sadnesse, from that vnto a madnesse,
    And so by continuance, and weakenesse of the braine
    Into this frensie, which now possesseth him:
    And if this be not true, take this from this.                     95

    _King_ Thinke you t'is so?

    _Cor._ How? so my Lord, I would very faine know
    That thing that I haue saide t'is so, positiuely,
    And it hath fallen out otherwise.
    Nay, if circumstances leade me on,                               100
    Ile finde it out, if it were hid
    As deepe as the centre of the earth.

    _King._ How should wee trie this same?

    _Cor._ Mary my good lord thus,
    The Princes walke is here in the galery,                         105
    There let _Ofelia_, walke vntill hee comes:
    Your selfe and I will stand close in the study,
    There shall you heare the effect of all his hart,
    And if it proue any otherwise then loue,
    Then let my censure faile an other time.                         110

    _King._ see where hee comes poring vppon a booke.

                            _Enter Hamlet._

    _Cor._ Madame, will it please your grace
    To leaue vs here?

    _Que._ With all my hart.       _exit._

    _Cor._ And here _Ofelia_, reade you on this booke,               115
    And walke aloofe, the King shal be vnseene.

    _Ham._ To be, or not to be, I there's the point,
    To Die, to sleepe, is that all? I all:
    No, to sleepe, to dreame, I mary there it goes,                  120
    For in that dreame of death, when wee awake,
    And borne before an euerlasting Iudge,
    From whence no passenger euer retur'nd,
    The vndiscouered country, at whose sight
    The happy smile, and the accursed damn'd.                        125
    But for this, the ioyfull hope of this,
    Whol'd beare the scornes and flattery of the world,
    Scorned by the right rich, the rich curssed of the poore?
    The widow being oppressed, the orphan wrong'd,
    The taste of hunger, or a tirants raigne,                        130
    And thousand more calamities besides,
    To grunt and sweate vnder this weary life,
    When that he may his full _Quietus_ make,
    With a bare bodkin, who would this indure,
    But for a hope of something after death?
    Which pusles the braine, and doth confound the sence,            135
    Which makes vs rather beare those euilles we haue,
    Than flie to others that we know not of.
    I that, O this conscience makes cowardes of vs all,
    Lady in thy orizons, be all my sinnes remembred.

    _Ofel._ My Lord, I haue sought opportunitie, which now           140
    I haue, to redeliuer to your worthy handes, a small remembrance,
    such tokens which I haue receiued of you.

    _Ham._ Are you faire?

    _Ofel._ My Lord.

    _Ham._ Are you honest?                                           145

    _Ofel._ What meanes my Lord?

    _Ham._ That if you be faire and honest,
    Your beauty should admit no discourse to your honesty.

    _Ofel._ My Lord, can beauty haue better priuiledge than
    with honesty?                                                    150

    _Ham._ Yea mary may it; for Beauty may transforme
    Honesty, from what she was into a bawd:
    Then Honesty can transforme Beauty:
    This was sometimes a Paradox,
    But now the time giues it scope.                                 155
    I neuer gaue you nothing.

    _Ofel._ My Lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them such earnest vowes of loue,
    As would haue moou'd the stoniest breast aliue,
    But now too true I finde,                                        160
    Rich giftes waxe poore, when giuers grow vnkinde.

    _Ham._ I neuer loued you.

    _Ofel._ You made me beleeue you did.

    _Ham._ O thou shouldst not a beleeued me!
    Go to a Nunnery goe, why shouldst thou                           165
    Be a breeder of sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,
    But I could accuse my selfe of such crimes
    It had beene better my mother had ne're borne me,
    O I am very prowde, ambitious, disdainefull,
    With more sinnes at my becke, then I haue thoughts               170
    To put them in, what should such fellowes as I
    Do, crawling between heauen and earth?
    To a Nunnery goe, we are arrant knaues all,
    Beleeue none of vs, to a Nunnery goe.

    _Ofel._ O heauens secure him!                                    175

    _Ham._ Wher's thy father?

    _Ofel._ At home my lord.

    _Ham._ For Gods sake let the doores be shut on him,
    He may play the foole no where but in his
    Owne house: to a Nunnery goe.                                    180

    _Ofel._ Help him good God.

    _Ham._ If thou dost marry, Ile giue thee
    This plague to thy dowry:
    Be thou as chaste as yce, as pure as snowe,
    Thou shalt not scape calumny, to a Nunnery goe.                  185

    _Ofel._ Alas, what change is this?

    _Ham._ But if thou wilt needes marry, marry a foole,
    For wisemen know well enough,
    What monsters you make of them, to a Nunnery goe.

    _Ofel._ Pray God restore him.                                    190

    _Ham._ Nay, I haue heard of your paintings too,
    God hath giuen you one face,
    And you make your selues another,
    You fig, and you amble, and you nickname Gods creatures,
    Making your wantonnesse, your ignorance,                         195
    A pox, t'is scuruy, Ile no more of it,
    It hath made me madde: Ile no more marriages,
    All that are married but one, shall liue,
    The rest shall keepe as they are, to a Nunnery goe,
    To a Nunnery goe.                   _exit._                      200

    _Ofe._ Great God of heauen, what a quicke change is this?
    The Courtier, Scholler, Souldier, all in him,
    All dasht and splinterd thence, O woe is me,
    To a seene what I haue seene, see what I see.      _exit._


[Sidenote: [SC. VII.]]

    _King_ Loue? No, no, that's not the cause,  _Enter King and Corambis._
    Some deeper thing it is that troubles him.

    _Cor._ Wel, something it is: my Lord, content you a while,
    I will my selfe goe feele him: let me worke,
    Ile try him euery way: see where he comes,                         5
    Send you those Gentlemen, let me alone
    To finde the depth of this, away, be gone.          _exit King._
    Now my good Lord, do you know me?                   _Enter Hamlet._

    _Ham._ Yea very well, y'are a fishmonger.

    _Cor._ Not I my Lord.                                             10

    _Ham._ Then sir, I would you were so honest a man,
    For to be honest, as this age goes,
    Is one man to be pickt out of tenne thousand.

    _Cor._ What doe you reade my Lord?

    _Ham._ Wordes, wordes.                                            15

    _Cor._ What's the matter my Lord?

    _Ham._ Betweene who?

    _Cor._ I meane the matter you reade my Lord.

    _Ham._ Mary most vile heresie:
    For here the Satyricall Satyre writes,
    That olde men haue hollow eyes, weake backes,
    Grey beardes, pittifull weake hammes, gowty legges,
    All which sir, I most potently beleeue not:
    For sir, your selfe shalbe olde as I am,
    If like a Crabbe, you could goe backeward.                        25

    _Cor._ How pregnant his replies are, and full of wit:
    Yet at first he tooke me for a fishmonger:
    All this comes by loue, the vemencie of loue,
    And when I was yong, I was very idle,
    And suffered much extasie in loue, very neere this:               30
    Will you walke out of the aire my Lord?

    _Ham._ Into my graue.

    _Cor._ By the masse that's out of the aire indeed,
    Very shrewd answers,
    My lord I will take my leaue of you.                              35

                 _Enter Gilderstone, and Rossencraft._

    _Ham._ You can take nothing from me sir,
    I will more willingly part with all,
    Olde doating foole.

    _Cor._ You seeke Prince Hamlet, see, there he is.      _exit._

    _Gil._ Health to your Lordship.                                   40

    _Ham._ What, Gilderstone, and _Rossencraft_,
    Welcome kinde Schoole-fellowes to Elsanoure.

    _Gil._ We thanke your Grace, and would be very glad
    You were as when we were at _Wittenberg_.

    _Ham._ I thanke you, but is this visitation free of               45
    Your selues, or were you not sent for?
    Tell me true, come, I know the good King and Queene
    Sent for you, there is a kinde of confession in your eye:
    Come, I know you were sent for.

    _Gil._ What say you?                                              50

    _Ham._ Nay then I see how the winde sits,
    Come, you were sent for.

    _Ross._ My lord, we were, and willingly if we might,
    Know the cause and ground of your discontent.

    _Ham._ Why I want preferment.                                     55

    _Ross._ I thinke not so my lord.

    _Ham._ Yes faith, this great world you see contents me not,
    No nor the spangled heauens, nor earth, nor sea,
    No nor Man that is so glorious a creature,
    Contents not me, no nor woman too, though you laugh.              60

    _Gil._ My lord, we laugh not at that.

    _Ham._ Why did you laugh then,
    When I said, Man did not content mee?

    _Gil._ My Lord, we laughed, when you said, Man did not
    content you.                                                      65
    What entertainement the Players shall haue,
    We boorded them a the way: they are comming to you.

    _Ham._ Players, what Players be they?

    _Ross._ My Lord, the Tragedians of the Citty,
    Those that you tooke delight to see so often.                     70

    _Ham._ How comes it that they trauell? Do they grow restie?

    _Gil._ No my Lord, their reputation holds as it was wont.

    _Ham._ How then?

    _Gil._ Yfaith my Lord, noueltie carries it away,
    For the principall publike audience that                          75
    Came to them, are turned to priuate playes,
    And to the humour of children.

    _Ham._ I doe not greatly wonder of it,
    For those that would make mops and moes
    At my vncle, when my father liued,                                80
    Now giue a hundred, two hundred pounds
    For his picture: but they shall be welcome,
    He that playes the King shall haue tribute of me,
    The ventrous Knight shall vse his foyle and target,
    The louer shall sigh gratis,                                      85
    The clowne shall make them laugh
    That are tickled in the lungs, or the blanke verse shall halt for't,
    And the Lady shall haue leaue to speake her minde freely.

                 _The Trumpets sound, Enter Corambis._

    Do you see yonder great baby?
    He is not yet out of his swadling clowts.                         90

    _Gil._ That may be, for they say an olde man
    Is twice a childe.

    _Ham._ Ile prophecie to you, hee comes to tell mee a the Players,
    You say true, a monday last, t'was so indeede.

    _Cor._ My lord, I haue news to tell you.                          95

    _Ham._ My Lord, I haue newes to tell you:
    When _Rossios_ was an Actor in _Rome_.

    _Cor._ The Actors are come hither, my lord.

    _Ham._ Buz, buz.

    _Cor._ The best Actors in Christendome,                          100
    Either for Comedy, Tragedy, Historie, Pastorall,
    Pastorall, Historicall, Historicall, Comicall,
    Comicall historicall, Pastorall, Tragedy historicall:
    _Seneca_ cannot be too heauy, nor _Plato_ too light:
    For the law hath writ those are the onely men.                   105

    _Ha._ O _Iepha_ Iudge of _Israel_! what a treasure hadst thou?

    _Cor._ Why what a treasure had he my lord?

    _Ham._ Why one faire daughter, and no more,
    The which he loued passing well.

    _Cor._ A, stil harping a my daughter! well my Lord,              110
    If you call me _Iepha_, I hane a daughter that
    I loue passing well.

    _Ham._ Nay that followes not.

    _Cor._ What followes then my Lord?

    _Ham._ Why by lot, or God wot, or as it came to passe,           115
    And so it was, the first verse of the godly Ballet
    Wil tel you all: for look you where my abridgement comes:
    Welcome maisters, welcome all,       _Enter players._

    Ladiship is growne by the altitude of a chopine higher than you were:
    Pray God sir your voyce, like a peece of vncurrant
    Golde, be not crack't in the ring: come on maisters,
    Weele euen too't, like French Falconers,                         125
    Flie at any thing we see, come, a taste of your
    Quallitie, a speech, a passionate speech.

    _Players_ What speech my good lord?

    _Ham._ I heard thee speake a speech once,
    But it was neuer acted: or if it were,                           130
    Neuer aboue twice, for as I remember,
    It pleased not the vulgar, it was cauiary
    To the million: but to me
    And others, that receiued it in the like kinde,
    Cried in the toppe of their iudgements, an excellent play,       135
    Set downe with as great modestie as cunning:
    One said there was no sallets in the lines to make the sauory,
    But called it an honest methode, as wholesome as sweete.
    Come, a speech in it I chiefly remember
    Was _Æneas_ tale to _Dido_,                                      140
    And then especially where he talkes of Princes slaughter,
    If it liue in thy memory beginne at this line,
    Let me see.
    The rugged _Pyrrus_, like th'arganian beast:
    No t'is not so, it begins with _Pirrus_:                         145
    O I haue it.
    The rugged _Pirrus_, he whose sable armes,
    Blacke as his purpose did the night resemble,
    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
    Hath now his blacke and grimme complexion smeered                150
    With Heraldry more dismall, head to foote,
    Now is he totall guise, horridely tricked
    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sonnes,
    Back't and imparched in calagulate gore,
    Rifted in earth and fire, olde grandsire _Pryam_ seekes:
    So goe on.

    _Cor._ Afore God, my Lord, well spoke, and with good accent.

    _Play._ Anone he finds him striking too short at Greeks,
    His antike sword rebellious to his Arme,
    Lies where it falles, vnable to resist.                          160
    _Pyrrus_ at _Pryam_ driues, but all in rage,
    Strikes wide, but with the whiffe and winde
    Of his fell sword, th' unnerued father falles.

    _Cor._ Enough my friend, t'is too long.

    _Ham._ It shall to the Barbers with your beard:                  165
    A pox, hee's for a Iigge, or a tale of bawdry,
    Or else he sleepes, come on to _Hecuba_, come.

    _Play._ But who, O who had seene the mobled Queene?

    _Cor._ Mobled Queene is good, faith very good.

    _Play._ All in the alarum and feare of death rose vp,            170
    And o're her weake and all ore-teeming loynes, a blancket
    And a kercher on that head, where late the diademe stoode,
    Who this had seene with tongue inuenom'd speech,
    Would treason haue pronounced,
    For if the gods themselues had seene her then,                   175
    When she saw _Pirrus_ with malitious strokes,
    Mincing her husbandes limbs,
    It would have made milch the burning eyes of heauen,
    And passion in the gods.

    _Cor._ Looke my lord if he hath not changde his colour,          180
    And hath teares in his eyes: no more good heart, no more.

    _Ham._ T'is well, t'is very well, I pray my lord,
    Will you see the Players well bestowed,
    I tell you they are the Chronicles
    And briefe abstracts of the time,                                185
    After your death I can tell you,
    You were better haue a bad Epiteeth,
    Then their ill report while you liue.

    _Cor._ My lord, I will vse them according to their deserts.

    _Ham._ O farre better man, vse euery man after his deserts,      190
    Then who should scape whipping?
    Vse them after your owne honor and dignitie,
    The lesse they deserue, the greater credit's yours.

    _Cor._ Welcome my good fellowes.        _exit._

    _Ham._ Come hither maisters, can you not play the murder         195
    of _Gonsago_?

    _Players_ Yes my Lord.

    _Ham._ And could'st not thou for a neede study me
    Some dozen or sixteene lines,
    Which I would set downe and insert?                              200

    _Players_ Yes very easily my good Lord.

    _Ham._ T'is well, I thanke you: follow that lord:
    And doe you heare sirs? take heede you mocke him not.
    Gentlemen, for your kindnes I thanke you,
    And for a time I would desire you leaue me.                      205

    _Gil._ Our loue and duetie is at your commaund.

                        _Exeunt all but Hamlet._

    _Ham._ Why what a dunghill idiote slaue am I?
    Why these Players here draw water from eyes:
    For Hecuba, why what is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?
    What would he do and if he had my losse?                         210
    His father murdred, and a Crowne bereft him,
    He would turne all his teares to droppes of blood,
    Amaze the standers by with his laments,
    Strike more then wonder in the iudiciall eares,
    Confound the ignorant, and make mute the wise,                   215
    Indeede his passion would be generall.
    Yet I like to an asse and Iohn a Dreames,
    Hauing my father murdred by a villaine,
    Stand still, and let it passe, why sure I am a coward:
    Who pluckes me by the beard, or twites my nose,                  220
    Giue's me the lie i'th throate downe to the lungs,
    Sure I should take it, or else I haue no gall,
    Or by this I should a fatted all the region kites
    With this slaues offell, this damned villaine,
    Treacherous, bawdy, murderous villaine:                          225
    Why this is braue, that I the sonne of my deare father,
    Should like a scalion, like a very drabbe
    Thus raile in wordes. About my braine,
    I haue heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play,
    Hath, by the very cunning of the scene, confest a murder         230
    Committed long before.
    This spirit that I haue seene may be the Diuell,
    And out of my weakenesse and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such men,
    Doth seeke to damne me, I will haue sounder proofes,             235
    The play's the thing,
    Wherein I'le catch the conscience of the King.        _exit._


[Sidenote: [SC. VIII.]]

                 _Enter the King, Queene, and Lordes._

    _King_ Lordes, can you by no meanes finde
    The cause of our sonne Hamlets lunacie?
    You being so neere in loue, euen from his youth,
    Me thinkes should gaine more than a stranger should.

    _Gil._ My lord, we haue done all the best we could,                5
    To wring from him the cause of all his griefe,
    But still he puts vs off, and by no meanes
    Would make an answere to that we exposde.

    _Ross._ Yet was he something more inclin'd to mirth
    Before we left him, and I take it,                                10
    He hath giuen order for a play to night,
    At which he craues your highnesse company.

    _King_ With all our heart, it likes vs very well:
    Gentlemen, seeke still to increase his mirth,
    Spare for no cost, our coffers shall be open,                     15
    And we vnto your selues will still be thankefull.

    _Both_ In all wee can, be sure you shall commaund.

    _Queene_ Thankes gentlemen, and what the Queene of _Denmarke_
    May pleasure you, be sure you shall not want.

    _Gil._ Weele once againe vnto the noble Prince.                   20

    _King_ Thanks to you both: Gertred you'l see this play.

    _Queene_ My lord I will, and it ioyes me at the soule
    He is inclin'd to any kinde of mirth.

    _Cor._ Madame, I pray be ruled by me:
    And my good Soueraigne, giue me leaue to speake,                  25
    We cannot yet finde out the very ground
    Of his distemperance, therefore
    I holde it meete, if so it please you,
    Else they shall not meete, and thus it is.

    _King_ What i'st _Corambis_?                                      30

    _Cor._ Mary my good lord this, soone when the sports are done,
    Madam, send you in haste to speake with him,
    And I my selfe will stand behind the Arras,
    There question you the cause of all his griefe,
    And then in loue and nature vnto you, hee'le tell you all:        35
    My Lord, how thinke you on't?

    _King_ It likes vs well, Gertred, what say you?

    _Queene_ With all my heart, soone will I send for him.

    _Cor._ My selfe will be that happy messenger,
    Who hopes his griefe will be reueal'd to her.        _exeunt omnes_  40


[Sidenote: [SC. IX.]]

                    _Enter Hamlet and the Players._

    _Ham._ Pronounce me this speech trippingly a the tongue
    as I taught thee,
    Mary and you mouth it, as a many of your players do
    I'de rather heare a towne bull bellow,
    Then such a fellow speake my lines.                                5
    Nor do not saw the aire thus with your hands,
    But giue euery thing his action with temperance.
    O it offends mee to the soule, to heare a rebustious periwig fellow,
    To teare a passion in totters, into very ragges,
    To split the eares of the ignoraut, who for the
    Most parte are capable of nothing but dumbe shewes and noises,
    I would haue such a fellow whipt, for o're doing, tarmagant
    It out, Herodes Herod.

    _players_ My Lorde, wee haue indifferently reformed that
    among vs.                                                         15

    _Ham._ The better, the better, mend it all together:
    There be fellowes that I haue seene play,
    And heard others commend them, and that highly too,
    That hauing neither the gate of Christian, Pagan,
    Nor Turke, haue so strutted and bellowed,                         20
    That you would a thought, some of Natures journeymen
    Had made men, and not made them well,
    They imitated humanitie, so abhominable:
    Take heede, auoyde it.

    _players_ I warrant you my Lord.                                  25

    _Ham._ And doe you heare? let not your Clowne speake
    More then is set downe, there be of them I can tell you
    That will laugh themselues, to set on some
    Quantitie of barren spectators to laugh with them,
    Albeit there is some necessary point in the Play                  30
    Then to be obserued: O t'is vile, and shewes
    A pittifull ambition in the foole that vseth it.
    And then you haue some agen, that keepes one sute
    Of ieasts, as a man is knowne by one sute of
    Apparell, and Gentlemen quotes his ieasts downe                   35
    In their tables, before they come to the play, as thus:
    Cannot you stay till I eate my porrige? and, you owe me
    A quarters wages: and, my coate wants a cullison:
    And, your beere is sowre: and, blabbering with his lips,
    And thus keeping in his cinkapase of ieasts,                      40
    When, God knows, the warme Clowne cannot make a iest
    Vnlesse by chance, as the blinde man catcheth a hare:
    Maisters tell him of it.

    _players_ We will my Lord.

    _Ham._ Well, goe make you ready.      _exeunt players._           45

    _Horatio_. Heere my Lord.

    _Ham._ _Horatio_, thou art euen as iust a man,
    As e're my conuersation cop'd withall.

    _Hor._ O my lord!

    _Ham._ Nay why should I flatter thee?                             50
    Why should the poore be flattered?
    What gaine should I receiue by flattering thee,
    That nothing hath but thy good minde?
    Let flattery sit on those time-pleasing tongs,
    To glose with them that loues to heare their praise,              55
    And not with such as thou _Horatio_.
    There is a play to night, wherein one Sceane they haue
    Comes very neere the murder of my father,
    When thou shalt see that Act afoote,
    Marke thou the King, doe but obserue his lookes,                  60
    For I mine eies will riuet to his face:
    And if he doe not bleach, and change at that,
    It is a damned ghost that we haue seene,
    _Horatio_, haue a care, obserue him well.

    _Hor._ My lord, mine eies shall still be on his face,             65
    And not the smallest alteration
    That shall appeare in him, but I shall note it.

    _Ham._ Harke, they come.

            _Enter King, Queene, Corambis, and other Lords._

    _King_ How now son _Hamlet_, how fare you, shall we haue a play?

    _Ham._ Yfaith the Camelions dish, not capon cramm'd,              70
    feed a the ayre.
    I father: My lord, you playd in the Vniuersitie.

    _Cor._ That I did my L: and I was counted a good actor.

    _Ham._ What did you enact there?

    _Cor._ My lord, I did act _Julius Cæsar_, I was killed            75
    in the Capitoll, _Brutus_ killed me.

    _Ham._ It was a brute parte of him,
    To kill so capitall a calfe.
    Come, be these Players ready?

    _Queene_ Hamlet come sit downe by me.                             80

    _Ham._ No by my faith mother, heere's a mettle more attractive:
    Lady will you giue me leaue, and so forth:
    To lay my head in your lappe?

    _Ofel._ No my lord.

    _Ham._ Vpon your lap, what do you thinke I meant contrary matters?  85

    _Enter in a Dumbe Shew, the King and the Queene, he sits downe
        in an Arbor, she leaues him: Then enters Lucianus with
        poyson in a Viall, and powres it in his eares, and goes
        away: Then the Queene commeth and findes him dead: and goes
        away with the other._

    _Ofel._ What meanes this my Lord?         _Enter the Prologue._

    _Ham._ This is myching Mallico, that meanes my chiefe.

    _Ofel._ What doth this meane my lord?

    _Ham._ You shall heare anone, this fellow will tell you all.

    _Ofel._ Will he tell vs what this shew meanes?                    90

    _Ham._ I, or any shew you'le shew him,
    Be not afeard to shew, hee'le not be afeard to tell:
    O these Players cannot keepe counsell, thei'le tell all.

    _Prol._ For vs, and for our Tragedie,
    Heere stowping to your clemencie,                                 95
    We begge your hearing patiently.

    _Ham._ I'st a prologue, or a poesie for a ring?

    _Ofel._ T'is short my Lord.

    _Ham._ As womens loue.

                    _Enter the Duke and Dutchesse._

    _Duke_ Full fortie yeares are past, their date is gone,          100
    Since happy time ioyn'd both our hearts as one:
    And now the blood that fill'd my youthfull veines,
    Runnes weakely in their pipes, and all the straines
    Of musicke, which whilome pleasde mine eare,
    Is now a burthen that Age cannot beare:                          105
    And therefore sweete Nature must pay his due,
    To heauen must I, and leaue the earth with you.

    _Dutchesse_ O say not so, lest that you kill my heart,
    When death takes you, let life from me depart.

    _Duke_ Content thy selfe, when ended is my date,                 110
    Thou maist (perchance) haue a more noble mate,
    More wise, more youthfull, and one.

    _Dutchesse_ O speake no more, for then I am accurst,
    None weds the second, but she kils the first:
    A second time I kill my Lord that's dead,                        115
    When second husband kisses me in bed.

    _Ham._ O wormewood, wormewood!

    _Duke_ I doe beleeue you sweete, what now you speake,
    But what we doe determine oft we breake,
    For our demises stil are ouerthrowne,                            120
    Our thoughts are ours, their end's none of our owne:
    So thinke you will no second husband wed,
    But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead.

    _Dutchesse_ Both here and there pursue me lasting strife,
    I once a widdow, euer I be wife.                                 125

    _Ham._ If she should breake now.

    _Duke_ T'is deepely sworne, sweete leaue me here a while,
    My spirites growe dull, and faine I would beguile the tedious
    time with sleepe.

    _Dutchesse_ Sleepe rocke thy braine,                             130
    And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.        _exit Lady_

    _Ham._ Madam, how do you like this play?

    _Queene_ The Lady protests too much.

    _Ham._ O but shee'le keepe her word.

    _King_ Haue you heard the argument, is there no offence          135
    in it?

    _Ham._ No offence in the world, poyson iniest, poison in iest.

    _King_ What do you call the name of the play?

    _Ham._ Mouse-trap: mary how trapically: this play is
    The image of a murder done in _guyana_, _Albertus_               140
    Was the Dukes name, his wife _Baptista_,
    Father, it is a knauish peece a worke: but what
    A that, it toucheth not vs, you and I that haue free
    Soules, let the galld iade wince, this is one
    _Lucianus_ nephew to the King.                                   145

    _Ofel._ Ya're as good as a _Chorus_ my lord.

    _Ham._ I could interpret the loue you beare, if I sawe the
    poopies dallying.

    _Ofel._ Y'are very pleasant my lord.

    _Ham._ Who I, your onlie jig-maker, why what shoulde             150
    a man do but be merry? for looke how cheerefully my mother
    lookes, my father died within these two houres.

    _Ofel._ Nay, t'is twice two months, my Lord.

    _Ham._ Two months, nay then let the diuell weare blacke,
    For i'le haue a sute of Sables: Iesus, two months dead,          155
    And not forgotten yet? nay then there's some
    Likelyhood, a gentlemans death may outliue memorie,
    But by my faith hee must build churches then,
    Or els hee must follow the olde Epitithe,
    With hoh, with ho, the hobi-horse is forgot.                     160

    _Ofel._ Your iests are keene my Lord.

    _Ham._ It would cost you a groning to take them off.

    _Ofel._ Still better and worse.

    _Ham._ So you must take your husband, begin. Murdred
    Begin, a poxe, leaue thy damnable faces and begin,               165
    Come, the croking rauen doth bellow for reuenge.

    _Murd._ Thoughts blacke, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing.
    Confederate season, else no creature seeing:
    Thou mixture rancke, of midnight weedes collected,
    With _Hecates_ bane thrise blasted, thrise infected,             170
    Thy naturall magicke, and dire propertie,
    One wholesome life vsurps immediately.      _exit._

    _Ham._ He poysons him for his estate.

    _King_ Lights, I will to bed.

    _Cor._ The king rises, lights hoe.                               175

                       _Exeunt King and Lordes._

    _Ham._ What, frighted with false fires?
    Then let the stricken deere goe weepe,

    T'is but stopping of these holes,

    It will giue most delicate musick.                               200

    You would seeme to know my stops, you would play vpon mee,       205
    You would search the very inward part of my hart,
    And diue into the secreet of my soule.

    Play vpon mee, besides, to be demanded by a spunge.

    _Ham._ I sir, a spunge, that sokes vp the kings
    Countenance, fauours, and rewardes, that makes
    His liberalitie your store house: but such as you,               215
    Do the king, in the end, best seruise;
    For hee doth keep you as an Ape doth nuttes,
    In the corner of his Iaw, first mouthes you,

    Of you, t'is but squeesing of you,                               220

    It is the portraiture, of your deceased husband,
    See here a face, to outface _Mars_ himselfe,                      30
    An eye, at which his foes did tremble at,
    A front wherin all vertues are set downe
    For to adorne a king, and guild his crowne,
    Whose heart went hand in hand euen with that vow,
    He made to you in marriage, and he is dead.                       35

    Looke you now, here is your husband,
    With a face like _Vulcan_.
    A looke fit for a murder and a rape,
    A dull dead hanging looke, and a hell-bred eie,                   40
    To affright children and amaze the world:
    And this same haue you left to change with this.

    To sweate vnder the yoke of infamie,
    To make increase of shame, to seale damnation.

    It is not madnesse that possesseth Hamlet.
    O mother, if euer you did my deare father loue,
    Forbeare the adulterous bed to night,

    But then he throwes and tosses me about,                         115
    As one forgetting that I was his mother:
    At last I call'd for help: and as I cried, _Corambis_
    Call'd, which Hamlet no sooner heard, but whips me
    Out his rapier, and cries, a Rat, a Rat, and in his rage

    Know of him where the body is.

    Where he is eaten, a certaine company of politicke wormes
    are euen now at him.
    Father, your fatte King, and your leane Beggar

    There's such diuinitie doth wall a king,                          55
    That treason dares not looke on.
    Let him goe _Gertred_, that your father is murdred,
    T'is true, and we most sory for it,
    Being the chiefest piller of our state:
    Therefore will you like a most desperate gamster,                 60
    Swoop-stake-like, draw at friend, and foe, and all?

    _Lear._ To his good friends thus wide I'le ope mine arms,
    And locke them in my hart, but to his foes,
    I will no reconcilement but by bloud.

    _King_ Why now you speake like a most louing sonne:               65
    And that in soule we sorrow for for his death,
    Your selfe ere long shall be a witnesse,
    Meane while be patient, and content your selfe.

                       _Enter Ofelia as before._

    _Lear._ Who's this, _Ofelia_? O my deere sister!
    I'st possible a yong maides life,                                 70
    Should be as mortall as an olde mans sawe?
    O heau'ns themselues! how now _Ofelia_?

    For remembrance: I pray Loue remember,
    And there's pansey for thoughts.                                  80

    _Lear._ A document in madnes, thoughts, remembrance:
    O God, O God!

    _Ofelia_ There is fennell for you, I would a giu'n you
    Some violets, but they all withered, when
    My father died: alas, they say the owle was                       85
    A Bakers daughter, we see what we are,
    But can not tell what we shall be.
    For bonny sweete Robin is all my joy.

    _Lear._ Thoughts & afflictions, torments worse than hell.

    _Ofel._ Nay Loue, I pray you make no words of this now:           90
    I pray now, you shall sing a downe,
    And you a downe a, t'is a the Kings daughter
    And the false steward, and if any body
    Aske you of any thing, say you this.

    Yong men will doo't when they come too't:
    By cocke they are too blame.
    Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
    You promised me to wed.
    So would I a done, by yonder Sunne,                              110
    If thou hadst not come to my bed.
    So God be with you all, God bwy Ladies.
    God bwy you Loue.           _exit Ofelia._

    _Lear._ Griefe vpon griefe, my father murdered,
    My sister thus distracted:                                       115
    Cursed be his soule that wrought this wicked act.

    _King_ Content you good Leartes for a time,
    Although I know your griefe is as a floud,
    Brimme full of sorrow, but forbeare a while,
    And thinke already the reuenge is done                           120
    On him that makes you such a haplesse sonne.

    _Lear._ You haue preuail'd my Lord, a while I'le striue,
    To bury griefe within a tombe of wrath,
    Which once vnhearsed, then the world shall heare
    Leartes had a father he held deere.                              125

    _King_ No more of that, ere many dayes be done,
    You shall heare that you do not dreame vpon.       _exeunt om._

    _Hor._ Madame, your sonne is safe arriv'de in _Denmarke_,
    This letter I euen now receiv'd of him,
    Whereas he writes how he escap't the danger,
    And subtle treason that the king had plotted,
    Being crossed by the contention of the windes,                     5
    He found the Packet sent to the king of _England_,
    Wherein he saw himselfe betray'd to death,
    As at his next conuersion with your grace,
    He will relate the circumstance at full.

    _Queene_ Then I perceiue there's treason in his lookes            10
    That seem'd to sugar o're his villanie:
    But I will soothe and please him for a time,
    For murderous mindes are alwayes jealous,
    But know not you _Horatio_ where he is?

    _Hor._ Yes Madame, and he hath appoynted me                       15
    To meete him on the east side of the Cittie
    To morrow morning.

    _Queene_ O faile not, good _Horatio_, and withall, commend me
    A mothers care to him, bid him a while
    Be wary of his presence, lest that he                             20
    Faile in that he goes about.

    _Hor._ Madam, neuer make doubt of that:
    I thinke by this the news be come to court:
    He is arriv'de, obserue the king, and you shall
    Quickely finde, _Hamlet_ being here,                              25
    Things fell not to his minde.

    _Queene_ But what became of _Gilderstone_ and _Rossencraft_?

    _Hor._ He being set ashore, they went for _England_,
    And in the Packet there writ down that doome
    To be perform'd on them poynted for him:                          30
    And by great chance he had his fathers Seale,
    So all was done without discouerie.

    _Queene_ Thankes be to heauen for blessing of the prince,
    _Horatio_ once againe I take my leaue,
    With thowsand mothers blessings to my sonne.                      35

                       _Enter King and Leartes._

    _King._ Hamlet from _England!_ is it possible?
    What chance is this? they are gone, and he come home.

    _Lear._ O he is welcome, by my soule he is:
    At it my iocund heart doth leape for ioy,
    That I shall liue to tell him, thus he dies.                       5

    _King_ Leartes, content your selfe, be rulde by me,
    And you shall haue no let for your reuenge.

    _Lear._ My will, not all the world.

    _King_ Nay but Leartes, marke the plot I haue layde,
    I haue heard him often with a greedy wish,                        10
    Vpon some praise that he hath heard of you
    Touching your weapon, which with all his heart,
    He might be once tasked for to try your cunning.

    _Lea._ And how for this?

    _King_ Mary Leartes thus: I'le lay a wager,                       15
    Shalbe on _Hamlets_ side, and you shall giue the oddes,
    The which will draw him with a more desire,
    To try the maistry, that in twelue venies
    You gaine not three of him: now this being granted,
    When you are hot in midst of all your play,                       20
    Among the foyles shall a keene rapier lie,
    Steeped in a mixture of deadly poyson,
    That if it drawes but the least dramme of blood,
    In any part of him, he cannot liue:
    This being done will free you from suspition,                     25
    And not the deerest friend that _Hamlet_ lov'de
    Will euer haue Leartes in suspect.

    _Lear._ My lord, I like it well:
    But say lord _Hamlet_ should refuse this match.

    _King_ I'le warrant you, wee'le put on you                        30
    Such a report of singularitie,
    Will bring him on, although against his will.
    And lest that all should misse,
    I'le haue a potion that shall ready stand,
    In all his heate when that he calles for drinke,                  35
    Shall be his period and our happinesse.

    _Lear._ T'is excellent, O would the time were come!
    Here comes the Queene.          _enter the Queene._

    _King_ How now Gertred, why looke you heauily?

    _Queene_ O my Lord, the yong _Ofelia_
    Hauing made a garland of sundry sortes of floures,
    Sitting vpon a willow by a brooke,
    The enuious sprig broke, into the brooke she fell,
    And for a while her clothes spread wide abroade,
    Bore the yong Lady vp: and there she sate smiling,                45
    Euen Mermaide-like, twixt heauen and earth,
    Chaunting olde sundry tunes vncapable
    As it were of her distresse, but long it could not be,
    Till that her clothes, being heauy with their drinke,
    Dragg'd the sweete wretch to death.                               50

    _Lear._ So, she is drownde:
    Too much of water hast thou _Ofelia_,
    Therefore I will not drowne thee in my teares,

    For woe begets woe, and griefe hangs on griefe.      _exeunt._    55

    _Clowne_ I say no, she ought not to be buried
    In christian buriall.

    _2._ Why sir?

    _Clowne_ Mary because shee's drownd.

    _2._ But she did not drowne her selfe.                             5

    _Clowne_ No, that's certaine, the water drown'd her.

    _2._ Yea but it was against her will.

    _Clowne_ No, I deny that, for looke you sir, I stand here,
    If the water come to me, I drowne not my selfe:
    But if I goe to the water, and am there drown'd,                  10
    _Ergo_ I am guiltie of my owne death:
    Y'are gone, goe y'are gone sir.

    Goest, tell me one thing, who buildes strongest,
    Of a Mason, a Shipwright, or a Carpenter?                         20

    _2._ Why a Mason, for he buildes all of stone,
    And will indure long.

    _Clowne_ That's prety, too't agen, too't agen.

    _2._ Why then a Carpenter, for he buildes the gallowes,
    And that brings many a one to his long home.                      25

    _Clowne_ Prety agen, the gallowes doth well, mary howe

    For such a ghest most meete.                                      35

    _Ham._ Hath this fellow any feeling of himselfe,
    That is thus merry in making of a graue?
    See how the slaue joles their heads against the earth.

    _Hor._ My lord, Custome hath made it in him seeme nothing.

    _Clowne_ A pick-axe and a spade, a spade,                         40
    For and a winding sheete,
    Most fit it is for to be made,

    Why mai't not be the scull of some Lawyer?                        45
    Me thinkes he should indite that fellow

    Him about the pate with's shouel: now where is your
    Quirkes and quillets now, your vouchers and
    Double vouchers, your leases and free-holde,                      50

    There's another, why may not that be such a ones
    Scull, that praised my Lord such a ones horse,                    60

    Lets question yonder fellow.

    _Clowne_ Mine sir.

    _Ham._ But who must lie in it?                                    65

    _Clowne_ If I should say, I should, I should lie in my throat sir.

    _Ham._ What man must be buried here?

    _Clowne_ No man sir.

    _Ham._ What woman?

    _Clowne._ No woman neither sir, but indeede                       70
    One that was a woman.

    _Ham._ An excellent fellow by the Lord _Horatio_,
    This seauen yeares haue I noted it: the toe of the pesant,
    Comes so neere the heele of the courtier,
    That hee gawles his kibe, I prethee tell mee one thing,           75
    How long will a man lie in the ground before hee rots?

    _Clowne_ Ifaith sir, if hee be not rotten before
    He be laide in, as we haue many pocky corses,
    He will last you, eight yeares, a tanner
    Will last you eight yeares full out, or nine.                     80

    _Ham._ And why a tanner?

    _Clowne_ Why his hide is so tanned with his trade,
    That it will holde out water, that's a parlous
    Deuourer of your dead body, a great soaker.
    Looke you, heres a scull hath bin here this dozen yeare,          85

    _Ham._ Vpon what ground?

    _Clowne_ A this ground, in _Denmarke_.

    _Ham._ Where is he now?

    _Clowne_ Why now they sent him to _England_.

    _Ham._ To _England_! wherefore?                                   95

    _Clowne_ Why they say he shall haue his wittes there,
    Or if he haue not, t'is no great matter there,
    It will not be seene there.

    _Ham._ Why not there?

    _Clowne_ Why there they say the men are as mad as he.            100

    _Ham_. Whose scull was this?

    _Clowne_ This, a plague on him, a madde rogues it was,
    He powred once a whole flagon of Rhenish of my head,
    Why do not you know him? this was one _Yorickes_ scull.

    _Ham._ Was this? I prethee let me see it, alas poore _Yoricke_   105
    I knew him _Horatio_,
    A fellow of infinite mirth, he hath caried mee twenty times
    vpon his backe, here hung those lippes that I haue Kissed a
    hundred times, and to see, now they abhorre me: Wheres
    your iests now _Yoricke_? your flashes of meriment: now go       110
    to my Ladies chamber, and bid her paint her selfe an inch
    thicke, to this she must come _Yoricke_. _Horatio_, I prethee
    tell me one thing, doost thou thinke that _Alexander_ looked
    thus?

    _Hor._ Euen so my Lord.                                          115

    _Ham._ And smelt thus?

    _Hor._ I my lord, no otherwise.

    _Ham._ No, why might not imagination worke, as thus of
    _Alexander_, _Alexander_ died, _Alexander_ was buried, _Alexander_
    became earth, of earth we make clay, and _Alexander_ being       120
    but clay, why might not time bring to passe, that he might
    stoppe the boung hole of a beere barrell?
    Imperious _Cæsar_ dead and turnd to clay,
    Might stoppe a hole, to keepe the winde away.

    _Lear._ The diuell take thy soule.

    _Ham._ O thou praiest not well,
    I prethee take thy hand from off my throate,
    For there is something in me dangerous,
    Which let thy wisedome feare, holde off thy hand:                150

    Wilt fight, wilt fast, wilt pray,

                                              _Exit Hamlet and Horatio._


[Sidenote: [SC. XVII.]]

    _Queene._ Alas, it is his madnes makes him thus,
    And not his heart, _Leartes_.

    _King._ My lord, t'is so: but wee'le no longer trifle,
    This very day shall _Hamlet_ drinke his last,
    For presently we meane to send to him,                             5
    Therfore _Leartes_ be in readynes.

    _Lear._ My lord, till then my soule will not bee quiet.

    _King._ Come _Gertred_, wee'l haue _Leartes_, and our sonne,
    Made friends and Louers, as befittes them both,
    Euen as they tender vs, and loue their countrie.                  10

    _Queene_ God grant they may.            _exeunt omnes._


[Sidenote: [SC. XVIII.]]

                       _Enter Hamlet and Horatio_

    _Ham._ Beleeue mee, it greeues mee much _Horatio_,
    That to _Leartes_ I forgot my selfe:
    For by my selfe me thinkes I feele his griefe,
    Though there's a difference in each others wrong.
        _Enter a Bragart Gentleman._
    _Horatio_, but marke yon water-flie,                               5
    The Court knowes him, but hee knowes not the Court.

    _Gent._ Now God saue thee, sweete prince _Hamlet_.

    _Ham._ And you sir: foh, how the muske-cod smels!

    _Gen._ I come with an embassage from his maiesty to you

    _Ham._ I shall sir giue you attention:                            10
    By my troth me thinkes t'is very colde.

    _Gent._ It is indeede very rawish colde.

    _Ham._ T'is hot me thinkes.

    _Gent._ Very swoltery hote:
    The King, sweete Prince, hath layd a wager on your side,          15
    Six Barbary horse, against six french rapiers,
    With all their acoutrements too, a the carriages:
    In good faith they are very curiously wrought.

    _Ham._ The cariages sir, I do not know what you meane.

    _Gent._ The girdles, and hangers sir, and such like.              20

    _Ham._ The worde had beene more cosin german to the
    phrase, if he could haue carried the canon by his side,
    And howe's the wager? I vnderstand you now.

    _Gent._ Mary sir, that yong _Leartes_ in twelue venies
    At Rapier and Dagger do not get three oddes of you,               25
    And on your side the King hath laide,
    And desires you to be in readinesse.

    _Ham._ Very well, if the King dare venture his wager,
    I dare venture my skull: when must this be?

    _Gent._ My Lord, presently, the king, and her maiesty,            30
    With the rest of the best iudgement in the Court,
    Are comming downe into the outward pallace.

    _Ham._ Goe tell his maiestie, I wil attend him.

    _Gent._ I shall deliuer your most sweet answer.          _exit._

    _Ham._ You may sir, none better, for y'are spiced,                35
    Else he had a bad nose could not smell a foole.

    _Hor._ He will disclose himselfe without inquirie.

    _Ham._ Beleeue me _Horatio_, my hart is on the sodaine
    Very sore, all here about.

    _Hor._ My lord, forbeare the challenge then.                      40

    _Ham._ No _Horatio_, not I, if danger be now,
    Why then it is not to come, theres a predestiuate prouidence
    in the fall of a sparrow: heere comes the King.

                 _Enter King, Queene, Leartes, Lordes._

    _King_ Now sonne _Hamlet_, we hane laid vpon your head,
    And make no question but to haue the best.                        45

    _Ham._ Your maiestie hath laide a the weaker side.

    _King._ We doubt it not, deliuer them the foiles.

    _Ham._ First Leartes, heere's my hand and loue,
    Protesting that I neuer wrongd _Leartes_.
    If _Hamlet_ in his madnesse did amisse,                           50
    That was not _Hamlet_, but his madnes did it,
    And all the wrong I e're did to _Leartes_,
    I here proclaime was madnes, therefore lets be at peace,
    And thinke I haue shot mine arrow o're the house,
    And hurt my brother.                                              55

    _Lear._ Sir I am satisfied in nature,
    But in termes of honor I'le stand aloofe,
    And will no reconcilement,
    Till by some elder maisters of our time
    I may be satisfied.                                               60

    _King_ Giue them the foyles.

    _Ham._ I'le be your foyle Leartes, these foyles,
    Haue all a laught, come on sir:             _a hit._

    _Lear._ No none.                  _Heere they play:_

    _Ham._ Iudgement.                                                 65

    _Gent._ A hit, a most palpable hit.

    _Lear._ Well, come againe.                  _They play againe._

    _Ham._ Another. Iudgement.

    _Lear._ I, I grant, a tuch, a tuch.

    _King_ Here _Hamlet_, the king doth drinke a health to thee       70

    _Queene_ Here _Hamlet_, take my napkin, wipe thy face.

    _King_ Giue him the wine.

    _Ham._ Set it by, I'le haue another bowt first,
    I'le drinke anone.

    _Queene_ Here _Hamlet_, thy mother drinkes to thee.               75

                            _Shee drinkes._

    _King_ Do not drinke _Gertred_: O t'is the poysned cup!

    _Ham._ _Leartes_ come, you dally with me,
    I pray you passe with your most cunningst play.

    _Lear._ I! say you so? haue at you,
    He hit you now my Lord:                                           80
    And yet it goes almost against my conscience.

    _Ham._ Come on sir.

        _They catch one anothers Rapiers, and both are wounded,
        Leartes falles downe, the Queene falles downe and dies._

    _King_ Looke to the Queene.

    _Queene_ O the drinke, the drinke, _Hamlet_, the drinke.

    _Ham._ Treason, ho, keepe the gates.                              85

    _Lords_ How ist my Lord _Leartes_?

    _Lear._ Euen as a coxcombe should,
    Foolishly slaine with my owne weapon:
    _Hamlet_, thou hast not in thee halfe an houre of life,
    The fatall Instrument is in thy hand.                             90
    Vnbated and invenomed: thy mother's poysned
    That drinke was made for thee.

    _Ham._ The poysned Instrument within my hand?
    Then venome to thy venome, die damn'd villaine:
    Come drinke, here lies thy vnion here.       _The king dies._     95

    _Lear._ O he is justly serued:
    _Hamlet_, before I die, here take my hand,
    And withall, my loue: I doe forgiue thee.       _Leartes dies._

    _Ham._ And I thee, O I am dead _Horatio_, fare thee well.

    _Hor._ No, I am more an antike Roman,                            100
    Then a Dane, here is some poison left.

    _Ham._ Vpon my loue I charge thee let it goe,
    O fie _Horatio_, and if thou shouldst die,
    What a scandale wouldst thou leaue behinde?
    What tongue should tell the story of our deaths,                 105
    If not from thee? O my heart sinckes _Horatio_,
    Mine eyes haue lost their sight, my tongue his vse:
    Farewel _Horatio_, heauen receiue my soule.       _Ham. dies._

           _Enter Voltemar and the Ambassadors from England.
                  Enter Fortenbrasse with his traine._

    _Fort._ Where is this bloudy sight?

    _Hor._ If aught of woe or wonder you'ld behold,
    Then looke vpon this tragicke spectacle.

    _Fort._ O imperious death! how many Princes
    Hast thou at one draft bloudily shot to death?

    _Ambass._ Our ambassie that we haue brought from _England_,
    Where be these Princes that should heare vs speake?              115
    O most most vnlooked for time! vnhappy country.

    _Hor._ Content your selues, Ile shew to all, the ground,
    The first beginning of this Tragedy:
    Let there a scaffold be rearde vp in the market place,
    And let the State of the world be there:                         120
    Where you shall heare such a sad story tolde,
    That neuer mortall man could more vnfolde.

    _Fort._ I haue some rights of memory to this kingdome,
    Which now to claime my leisure doth inuite mee:
    Let foure of our chiefest Captaines                              125
    Beare _Hamlet_ like a souldier to his graue:
    For he was likely, had he liued,
    To a prou'd most royall.
    Take vp the bodie, such a fight as this
    Becomes the fieldes, but here doth much amisse.                  130

                               KING LEAR.




ACT I.


SCENE I. _King Lear's palace._

             _Enter_ KENT, GLOUCESTER, _and_ EDMUND.[2424]

    _Kent._ I thought the king had more affected the Duke[2425][2426]
    of Albany than Cornwall.[2425][2426]

    _Glou._ It did always seem so to us: but now, in the[2425][2426][2427]
    division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes[2425][2426][2428]
    he values most; for equalities are so weighed that
        curiosity[2425][2426][2429]                                    5
    in neither can make choice of either's moiety.[2425][2426]

    _Kent._ Is not this your son, my lord?[2425]

    _Glou._ His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I[2425]
    have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am[2425]
    brazed to it.[2425][2430]                                         10

    _Kent._ I cannot conceive you.[2425]

    _Glou._ Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon[2425]
    she grew round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her[2425]
    cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a[2425]
    fault?[2425]                                                      15

    _Kent._ I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it[2425]
    being so proper.[2425]

    _Glou._ But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year[2425][2431]
    elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though[2425][2432]
    this knave came something saucily into the world before he[2425][2433]  20
    was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport[2425]
    at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged.[2425][2434]
    Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?[2425][2435]

    _Edm._ No, my lord.[2425][2436]

    _Glou._ My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my[2425][2437]  25
    honourable friend.[2425][2437]

    _Edm._ My services to your lordship.[2425]

    _Kent._ I must love you, and sue to know you better.[2425]

    _Edm._ Sir, I shall study deserving.[2425][2438]

    _Glou._ He hath been out nine years, and away he shall[2425]      30
    again. The king is coming.[2425][2439]

      _Sennet. Enter one bearing a coronet,_ KING LEAR, CORNWALL,
       ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, _and_ Attendants.[2440]

    _Lear._ Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.[2441]

    _Glou._ I shall, my liege.    [_Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund._[2442]

    _Lear._ Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.[2443]
    Give me the map there. Know we have divided[2444]                 35
    In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent[2445]
    To shake all cares and business from our age,[2446]
    Conferring them on younger strengths, while we[2447][2448]
    Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,[2448]
    And you, our no less loving son of Albany,[2448][2449]            40
    We have this hour a constant will to publish[2448]
    Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife[2448][2450]
    May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,[2448][2451]
    Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,[2452]
    Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,                45
    And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,[2453]
    Since now we will divest us both of rule,[2454]
    Interest of territory, cares of state,[2454][2455]
    Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
    That we our largest bounty may extend                             50
    Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,[2456]
    Our eldest-born, speak first.[2457]

    _Gon._ Sir, I love you more than words can wield the
            matter,[2457][2458]
    Dearer than eye-sight, space and liberty,[2459]
    Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,                          55
    No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour,
    As much as child e'er loved or father found;[2460]
    A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;
    Beyond all manner of so much I love you.[2461]

    _Cor._ [_Aside_] What shall Cordelia do? Love, and be silent.[2462]  60

    _Lear._ Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
    With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,[2463][2464][2465]
    With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,[2464]
    We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue[2466]
    Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,[2467]           65
    Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.[2468]

    _Reg._ I am made of that self metal as my sister,[2469]
    And prize me at her worth. In my true heart[2470]
    I find she names my very deed of love;[2471]
    Only she comes too short: that I profess[2471][2472]              70
    Myself an enemy to all other joys[2471]
    Which the most precious square of sense possesses,[2473]
    And find I am alone felicitate[2474][2475]
    In your dear highness' love.[2474]

    _Cor._               [_Aside_] Then poor Cordelia![2476][2477][2478]
    And yet not so, since I am sure my love's[2479][2480]             75
    More ponderous than my tongue.[2477][2480][2481]

    _Lear._ To thee and thine hereditary ever
    Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
    No less in space, validity and pleasure,
    Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,[2482][2483][2484]   80
    Although the last, not least, to whose young love[2483][2485]
    The vines of France and milk of Burgundy[2483]
    Strive to be interess'd, what can you say to draw[2483][2486]
    A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.[2483][2487]

    _Cor._ Nothing, my lord.                                          85

    _Lear._ Nothing![2488]

    _Cor._ Nothing.[2488]

    _Lear._ Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.[2489]

    _Cor._ Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave[2490][2491]
    My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty[2490]                 90
    According to my bond; nor more nor less.[2490][2492]

    _Lear._ How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,[2493]
    Lest it may mar your fortunes.[2494]

    _Cor._                         Good my lord,
    You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I[2495][2496]
    Return those duties back as are right fit,[2496][2497]            95
    Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
    Why have my sisters husbands, if they say[2498]
    They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,[2498][2499][2500]
    That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry[2500]
    Half my love with him, half my care and duty:[2500]              100
    Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,[2500][2501][2502]
    To love my father all.[2502][2503]

    _Lear._ But goes thy heart with this?

    _Cor._                                Ay, good my lord.[2504]

    _Lear._ So young, and so untender?

    _Cor._ So young, my lord, and true.                              105

    _Lear._ Let it be so; thy truth then be thy dower:[2505]
    For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
    The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;[2506]
    By all the operation of the orbs[2507]
    From whom we do exist and cease to be;                           110
    Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
    Propinquity and property of blood,
    And as a stranger to my heart and me
    Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,[2508]
    Or he that makes his generation messes[2509]                     115
    To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom[2509][2510]
    Be as well neighbour'd, pitied and relieved,[2510]
    As thou my sometime daughter.

    _Kent._                       Good my liege,--[2511]

    _Lear._ Peace, Kent![2512]
    Come not between the dragon and his wrath.[2512]                 120
    I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
    On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight![2513]
    So be my grave my peace, as here I give
    Her father's heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?
    Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,[2514]                        125
    With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:[2515]
    Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
    I do invest you jointly with my power,[2516]
    Pre-eminence and all the large effects[2517]
    That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,[2518]       130
    With reservation of an hundred knights
    By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
    Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain[2519]
    The name and all the additions to a king;[2520][2521]
    The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,[2520][2522]            135
    Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
    This coronet part betwixt you.[2523]

    _Kent._                        Royal Lear,
    Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,[2524]
    Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,[2525]
    As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--[2526]             140

    _Lear._ The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.

    _Kent._ Let it fall rather, though the fork invade[2527]
    The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
    When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?[2528]
    Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,               145
    When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,[2529]
    When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom,[2530]
    And in thy best consideration check[2531]
    This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement,[2532]
    Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;                  150
    Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound[2533]
    Reverbs no hollowness.[2533]

    _Lear._                Kent, on thy life, no more.[2534]

    _Kent._ My life I never held but as a pawn[2535]
    To wage against thy enemies, nor fear to lose it,[2536]
    Thy safety being the motive.[2537]

    _Lear._                      Out of my sight!                    155

    _Kent._ See better, Lear, and let me still remain
    The true blank of thine eye.

    _Lear._ Now, by Apollo,--

    _Kent._                   Now, by Apollo, king,[2538][2539]
    Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.[2538]

    _Lear._                         O, vassal! miscreant!

                                 [_Laying his hand on his sword._[2540]

    _Alb._ } Dear sir, forbear.[2541]                                160
    _Corn._}

    _Kent._ Do;[2542]
    Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow[2543][2544]
    Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy doom;[2543][2545]
    Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,[2543]
    I'll tell thee them dost evil.[2543]

    _Lear._                        Hear me, recreant![2546][2547]    165
    On thy allegiance, hear me![2546][2548]
    Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,[2549]
    Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride[2550]
    To come between our sentence and our power,[2551]
    Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,                     170
    Our potency made good, take thy reward.[2552]
    Five days we do allot thee, for provision[2553]
    To shield thee from diseases of the world,[2554]
    And on the sixth to turn thy hated back[2555]
    Upon our kingdom: if on the tenth day following[2556]            175
    Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
    The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,[2557]
    This shall not be revoked.

    _Kent._ Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,[2558]
    Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.[2559]               180
    [_To Cordelia_] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,[2560]
    That justly think'st and hast most rightly said![2561]
    [_To Regan and Goneril_] And your large speeches may
        your deeds approve,[2562]
    That good effects may spring from words of love.
    Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;                        185
    He'll shape his old course in a country new.          [_Exit._[2563]

    _Flourish. Re-enter_ GLOUCESTER, _with_ FRANCE, BURGUNDY, _and_
                           Attendants.[2564]

    _Glou._ Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.[2565]

    _Lear._ My lord of Burgundy,[2566][2567]
    We first address towards you, who with this king[2566][2568]
    Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,[2566][2569]  190
    Will you require in present dower with her,[2566]
    Or cease your quest of love?[2566][2570]

    _Bur._                       Most royal majesty,[2571]
    I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,[2571][2572]
    Nor will you tender less.[2571][2573]

    _Lear._                   Right noble Burgundy,[2574]
    When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;[2574][2575]         195
    But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:[2574][2576]
    If aught within that little seeming substance,[2574][2577]
    Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,[2574][2578]
    And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,[2579]
    She's there, and she is yours.

    _Bur._                         I know no answer.                 200

    _Lear._ Will you, with those infirmities she owes,[2580]
    Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
    Dower'd with our curse and stranger'd with our oath,[2581]
    Take her, or leave her?[2582]

    _Bur._                  Pardon me, royal sir;[2583][2584]
    Election makes not up on such conditions.[2584][2585]            205

    _Lear._ Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
    I tell you all her wealth. [_To France_] For you, great king,[2586]
    I would not from your love make such a stray,
    To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
    To avert your liking a more worthier way[2587]                   210
    Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
    Almost to acknowledge hers.

    _France._                   This is most strange,[2588]
    That she, that even but now was your best object,[2588][2589]
    The argument of your praise, balm of your age,[2588][2590]
    Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time[2588][2591]  215
    Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle[2588]
    So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence[2588][2592]
    Must be of such unnatural degree[2588]
    That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection[2593][2594]
    Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,[2594][2595]          220
    Must be a faith that reason without miracle[2596]
    Could never plant in me.[2596]

    _Cor._                   I yet beseech your majesty,--[2597][2598]
    If for I want that glib and oily art,[2598][2599]
    To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,[2600]
    I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known[2601]             225
    It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,[2602]
    No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,[2603]
    That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;[2604]
    But even for want of that for which I am richer,[2605]
    A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue[2606]                  230
    As I am glad I have not, though not to have it[2607]
    Hath lost me in your liking.

    _Lear._                      Better thou[2608][2609]
    Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.[2609][2610]

    _France._  Is it but this, a tardiness in nature[2611]
    Which often leaves the history unspoke[2612][2613]               235
    That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,[2613][2614]
    What say you to the lady? Love's not love[2613][2615]
    When it is mingled with regards that stand[2613][2616]
    Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?[2617]
    She is herself a dowry.[2618]

    _Bur._                  Royal Lear,[2619][2620]                  240
    Give but that portion which yourself proposed,[2620]
    And here I take Cordelia by the hand,[2620]
    Duchess of Burgundy.[2620]

    _Lear._ Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.[2621]

    _Bur._ I am sorry then you have so lost a father[2622]           245
    That you must lose a husband.

    _Cor._                        Peace be with Burgundy![2623][2624]
    Since that respects of fortune are his love,[2623][2625]
    I shall not be his wife.[2623]

    _France._ Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor,[2626]
    Most choice forsaken, and most loved despised,                   250
    Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:[2627]
    Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.[2628]
    Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect[2629]
    My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
    Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,[2630]         255
    Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
    Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy[2631]
    Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.[2632]
    Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:[2633][2634]
    Thou losest here, a better where to find.[2634]                  260

    _Lear_. Thou hast her, France: let her be thine, for we[2635]
    Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see[2635]
    That face of hers again. Therefore be gone[2636]
    Without our grace, our love, our benison.[2637][2638]
    Come, noble Burgundy.[2637]                                      265

                             [_Flourish. Exeunt all but France, Goneril,
                                             Regan, and Cordelia._[2639]

    _France._ Bid farewell to your sisters.[2640]

    _Cor._ The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes[2641][2642]
    Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;[2642][2643]
    And, like a sister, am most loath to call[2642]
    Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:[2642][2644]  270
    To your professed bosoms I commit him:[2645]
    But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
    I would prefer him to a better place.[2646]
    So farewell to you both.

    _Reg._ Prescribe not us our duties.[2647]

    _Gon._                              Let your study[2648]         275
    Be to content your lord, who hath received you[2648]
    At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,[2648][2649]
    And well are worth the want that you have wanted.[2650]

    _Cor._ Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:[2651]
    Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.[2652]              280
    Well may you prosper!

    _France._             Come, my fair Cordelia.

                                    [_Exeunt France and Cordelia._[2653]

    _Gon._ Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
        most[2654][2655][2656]
    nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence[2655][2657]
    to-night.[2655]

    _Reg._ That's most certain, and with you; next month[2658]       285
    with us.

    _Gon._ You see how full of changes his age is; the observation[2659]
    we have made of it hath not been little: he always[2660]
    loved our sister most; and with what poor judgement he hath
    now cast her off appears too grossly.[2661]                      290

    _Reg._ 'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but
    slenderly known himself.

    _Gon._ The best and soundest of his time hath been but
    rash; then must we look to receive from his age, not alone[2662]
    the imperfections of long ingrafted condition, but[2663]         295
    therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric[2664]
    years bring with them.

    _Reg._ Such unconstant starts are we like to have from[2665]
    him as this of Kent's banishment.

    _Gon._ There is further compliment of leave-taking between[2666]  300
    France and him. Pray you, let's hit together: if our[2667]
    father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears,[2668]
    this last surrender of his will but offend us.

    _Reg._ We shall further think on 't.[2669]

    _Gon._ We must do something, and i' the heat.        [_Exeunt._  305


SCENE II. _The Earl of Gloucester's castle._

                 _Enter_ EDMUND, _with a letter_.[2670]

    _Edm._ Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law[2671]
    My services are bound. Wherefore should I[2671]
    Stand in the plague of custom, and permit[2671][2672]
    The curiosity of nations to deprive me,[2671][2673]
    For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines[2671]             5
    Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?[2671][2674]
    When my dimensions are as well compact,[2671][2675]
    My mind as generous and my shape as true,[2671]
    As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us[2671][2676]
    With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?[2671][2677]       10
    Who in the lusty stealth of nature take[2671]
    More composition and fierce quality[2671]
    Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,[2671][2678]
    Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,[2671][2679]
    Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,[2671][2680]                15
    Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:[2671]
    Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund[2671]
    As to the legitimate: fine word,'legitimate!'[2671][2681]
    Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed[2671]
    And my invention thrive, Edmund the base[2671][2676]              20
    Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:[2671][2682]
    Now, gods, stand up for bastards![2671]

                       _Enter_ GLOUCESTER.[2671]

    _Glou._ Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted![2671][2683][2684]
    And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power![2671][2684][2685]
    Confined to exhibition! All this done[2671][2684][2686]           25
    Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?[2671][2684]

    _Edm._ So please your lordship, none.

                                        [_Putting up the letter._[2687]

    _Glou._ Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?[2688]

    _Edm._ I know no news, my lord.

    _Glou._ What paper were you reading?                              30

    _Edm._ Nothing, my lord.

    _Glou._ No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of[2689]
    it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath not such
    need to hide itself. Let's see: come, if it be nothing, I shall[2690]
    not need spectacles.                                              35

    _Edm._ I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter from[2691]
    my brother, that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much[2692]
    as I have perused, I find it not fit for your o'er-looking.[2693]

    _Glou._ Give me the letter, sir.

    _Edm._ I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The[2694]     40
    contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.[2694][2695]

    _Glou._ Let's see, let's see.

    _Edm._ I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
    this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.[2696]

    _Glou._ [_Reads_] 'This policy and reverence of age makes[2697]   45
    the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes[2698]
    from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find
    an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny;
    who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come[2699]
    to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would         50
    sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for
    ever, and live the beloved of your brother,                  EDGAR.'
    Hum! Conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him, you should[2700]
    enjoy half his revenue!'--My son Edgar! Had he a hand
    to write this? a heart and brain to breed it in? When[2701]       55
    came this to you? who brought it?[2702]

    _Edm._ It was not brought me, my lord; there's the cunning
    of it; I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.

    _Glou._ You know the character to be your brother's?

    _Edm._ If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear            60
    it were his; but, in respect of that, I would fain think it[2703][2704]
    were not.[2703]

    _Glou._ It is his.[2705]

    _Edm._ It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is[2706]
    not in the contents.                                              65

    _Glou._ Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this[2707]
    business?

    _Edm._ Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft maintain[2708]
    it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining,[2709]
    the father should be as ward to the son, and the[2710]            70
    son manage his revenue.[2711]

    _Glou._ O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!
    Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain!
    worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; ay, apprehend[2712]
    him: abominable villain! Where is he?                             75

    _Edm._ I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please[2713]
    you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you
    can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you[2714]
    should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed[2715]
    against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great         80
    gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of[2716]
    his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him that he[2717]
    hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honour and to[2718]
    no further pretence of danger.[2719]

    _Glou._ Think you so?                                             85

    _Edm._ If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
    where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular[2720]
    assurance have your satisfaction, and that without any further
    delay than this very evening.

    _Glou._ He cannot be such a monster--[2721]                       90

    _Edm._ Nor is not, sure.[2722]

    _Glou._ To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves[2722]
    him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me[2722][2723]
    into him, I pray you: frame the business after your own[2724]
    wisdom. I would unstate myself, to be in a due resolution.        95

    _Edm._ I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business[2725]
    as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.[2726]

    _Glou._ These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend[2727][2728]
    no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can reason it[2729]
    thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent[2730]  100
    effects: love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide:
    in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces,[2731]
    treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son and father. This[2732][2733]
    villain of mine comes under the prediction; there's son[2733]
    against father: the king falls from bias of nature; there's[2733]  105
    father against child. We have seen the best of our time:[2733]
    machinations, hollowness, treachery and all ruinous disorders[2733]
    follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this[2733]
    villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully.[2734]
    And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his offence,       110
    honesty! 'Tis strange.                                [_Exit._[2735]

    _Edm._ This is the excellent foppery of the world, that[2736]
    when we are sick in fortune--often the surfeit of our own[2737]
    behaviour--we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the
    moon and the stars: as if we were villains by necessity,[2738]   115
    fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves and treachers,[2739]
    by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars and adulterers,[2740]
    by an enforced obedience of planetary influence;
    and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on: an admirable
    evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish                   120
    disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded[2741]
    with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my nativity
    was under Ursa major; so that it follows I am rough and
    lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am, had the[2742]
    maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my[2743]           125
    bastardizing. Edgar--[2744][2745][2746]

                             _Enter_ EDGAR.

    And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy:[2744][2745]
    my cue is villanous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o'[2745][2747]
    Bedlam. O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! fa,[2745][2748][2749]
    sol, la, mi.[2749][2750]                                         130

    _Edg._ How now, brother Edmund! what serious contemplation
    are you in?

    _Edm._ I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
    this other day, what should follow these eclipses.[2727]

    _Edg._ Do you busy yourself about that?[2751]                    135

    _Edm._ I promise you, the effects he writ of succeed[2752]
    unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child and the[2753]
    parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities;[2753][2754]
    divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king and[2753]
    nobles; needless diffidences, banishment of friends,[2753]       140
    dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.[2753][2755]

    _Edg._ How long have you been a sectary astronomical?[2753]

    _Edm._ Come, come; when saw you my father last?[2753]

    _Edg._ Why, the night gone by.[2756]

    _Edm._ Spake you with him?                                       145

    _Edg._ Ay, two hours together.[2757]

    _Edm._ Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure
    in him by word or countenance?[2758]

    _Edg._ None at all.

    _Edm._ Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended[2759]      150
    him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some[2760]
    little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which
    at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of[2761]
    your person it would scarcely allay.[2762]

    _Edg._ Some villain hath done me wrong.                          155

    _Edm._ That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent[2763]
    forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower and, as I[2763]
    say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly[2763]
    bring you to hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my[2763][2764]
    key: if you do stir abroad, go armed.[2763]                      160

    _Edg._ Armed, brother![2763]

    _Edm._ Brother, I advise you to the best: go armed: I[2763][2765]
    am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards[2766]
    you: I have told you what I have seen and heard; but[2767]
    faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it: pray you,[2767]  165
    away.

    _Edg._ Shall I hear from you anon?

    _Edm._ I do serve you in this business.         [_Exit Edgar._[2768]
    A credulous father, and a brother noble,
    Whose nature is so far from doing harms                          170
    That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
    My practices ride easy. I see the business.
    Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
    All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.            [_Exit._[2769]


SCENE III. _The Duke of Albany's palace._

           _Enter_ GONERIL _and_ OSWALD, _her steward_.[2770]

    _Gon._ Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding
    of his fool?

    _Osw._ Yes, madam.[2771][2772]

    _Gon._ By day and night he wrongs me; every hour[2773][2774]
    He flashes into one gross crime or other,[2774]                    5
    That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
    His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us[2775]
    On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,[2776]
    I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
    If you come slack of former services,                             10
    You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.

    _Osw._ He's coming, madam; I hear him.        [_Horns within._[2777]

    _Gon._ Put on what weary negligence you please,[2778][2779]
    You and your fellows; I'ld have it come to question:[2778][2780]
    If he distaste it, let him to our sister,[2778][2781]             15
    Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,[2778]
    Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,[2782]
    That still would manage those authorities[2782]
    That he hath given away! Now, by my life,[2782]
    Old fools are babes again, and must be used[2782][2783]           20
    With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused.[2782][2784]
    Remember what I tell you.

    _Osw._                    Very well, madam.[2785]

    _Gon._ And let his knights have colder looks among you;[2786]
    What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:[2786][2787]
    I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,[2788]            25
    That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,[2788][2789]
    To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.   [_Exeunt._[2789][2790]


SCENE IV. _A hall in the same._

                    _Enter_ KENT, _disguised_.[2791]

    _Kent._ If but as well I other accents borrow,[2792][2793]
    That can my speech defuse, my good intent[2792][2794]
    May carry through itself to that full issue[2792]
    For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,[2792][2795]
    If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,[2792]         5
    So may it come, thy master whom thou lovest[2792][2796]
    Shall find thee full of labours.[2792]

      _Horns within. Enter_ LEAR, Knights, _and_ Attendants.[2797]

    _Lear._ Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.
    [_Exit an Attendant._] How now! what art thou?[2798]

    _Kent._ A man, sir.                                               10

    _Lear._ What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou
    with us?

    _Kent._ I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
    him truly that will put me in trust; to love him that is honest;
    to converse with him that is wise and says little; to fear[2799]  15
    judgement; to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.

    _Lear._ What art thou?[2800]

    _Kent._ A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as
    the king.

    _Lear._ If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a[2801]     20
    king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?[2802]

    _Kent._ Service.

    _Lear._ Who wouldst thou serve?[2803]

    _Kent._ You.

    _Lear._ Dost thou know me, fellow?                                25

    _Kent._ No, sir; but you have that in your countenance
    which I would fain call master.

    _Lear._ What's that?[2804]

    _Kent._ Authority.

    _Lear._ What services canst thou do?[2805]                        30

    _Kent._ I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a[2806]
    curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
    bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified
    in, and the best of me is diligence.

    _Lear._ How old art thou?                                         35

    _Kent._ Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing,[2807]
    nor so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years on my
    back forty eight.

    _Lear._ Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no[2808][2809]
    worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner,[2809][2810]  40
    ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool? Go you, and[2810]
    call my fool hither.                     [_Exit an Attendant._[2811]

                         _Enter_ OSWALD.[2812]

    You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?[2813]

    _Osw._ So please you,--                               [_Exit._[2814]

    _Lear._ What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll[2815]       45
    back. [_Exit a Knight._] Where's my fool, ho? I think[2816]
    the world's asleep.

                        _Re-enter_ Knight.[2817]

    How now! where's that mongrel?

    _Knight._ He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.[2818]

    _Lear._ Why came not the slave back to me when I                  50
    called him?

    _Knight._ Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner,[2819][2820]
    he would not.

    _Lear._ He would not![2821]

    _Knight._ My lord, I know not what the matter is; but,[2819]      55
    to my judgement, your highness is not entertained with that
    ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a great
    abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants[2822]
    as in the duke himself also and your daughter.

    _Lear._ Ha! sayest thou so?                                       60

    _Knight._ I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be[2819]
    mistaken; for my duty cannot be silent when I think
    your highness wronged.[2823]

    _Lear._ Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception:[2824]
    I have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I[2825]      65
    have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as[2826]
    a very pretence and purpose of unkindness: I will look[2827]
    further into't. But where's my fool? I have not seen him[2828]
    this two days.[2829]

    _Knight._ Since my young lady's going into France, sir,[2830]     70
    the fool hath much pined away.

    _Lear._ No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you,[2831]
    and tell my daughter I would speak with her.         [_Exit an[2832]
    Attendant._] Go you, call hither my fool.      [_Exit an Attendant._

                        _Re-enter_ OSWALD.[2833]

    O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I, sir?[2834]       75

    _Osw._ My lady's father.

    _Lear._ My lady's father! my lord's knave: you whoreson
    dog! you slave! you cur!

    _Osw._ I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your[2835][2836][2837]
    pardon.[2835][2837]                                               80

    _Lear._ Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

                                                 [_Striking him._[2838]

    _Osw._ I'll not be struck, my lord.[2839]

    _Kent._ Nor tripped neither, you base foot-ball player.[2840]

                                              [_Tripping up his heels._

    _Lear._ I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll[2841]
    love thee.[2841]                                                  85

    _Kent._ Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:[2842]
    away, away! If you will measure your lubber's length again,[2843]
    tarry: but away! go to; have you wisdom? so.[2844]

                                                  [_Pushes Oswald out._

    _Lear._ Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's[2845]
    earnest of thy service.              [_Giving Kent money._[2846]  90

                             _Enter_ Fool.

    _Fool._ Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.[2847]

                                              [_Offering Kent his cap._

    _Lear._ How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?

    _Fool._ Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

    _Kent._ Why, fool?[2848]

    _Fool._ Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:[2849]    95
    nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch[2850]
    cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb: why, this fellow hath[2851]
    banished two on's daughters, and done the third a blessing[2852]
    against his will; if thou follow him, thou must needs wear
    my coxcomb. How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs            100
    and two daughters![2853]

    _Lear._ Why, my boy?

    _Fool._ If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs[2854]
    myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.

    _Lear._ Take heed, sirrah; the whip.                             105

    _Fool._ Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped[2855]
    out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and[2856]
    stink.

    _Lear._ A pestilent gall to me![2857]

    _Fool._ Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.[2858]                  110

    _Lear._ Do.[2859]

    _Fool._ Mark it, nuncle:[2860]
            Have more than thou showest,[2861]
            Speak less than thou knowest,[2861]
            Lend less than thou owest,[2861]                         115
            Ride more than thou goest,[2861]
            Learn more than thou trowest,[2861]
            Set less than thou throwest;[2861]
            Leave thy drink and thy whore,[2861]
            And keep in-a-door,[2861][2862]                          120
            And thou shalt have more[2861]
            Than two tens to a score.[2861]

    _Kent._ This is nothing, fool.[2863]

    _Fool._ Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer,[2864]
    you gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of[2865]          125
    nothing, nuncle?[2866]

    _Lear._ Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of
    nothing.

    _Fool._ [To Kent] Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of[2867]
    his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.                   130

    _Lear._ A bitter fool![2868]

    _Fool._ Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between[2868][2869]
    a bitter fool and a sweet fool?[2868][2870]

    _Lear._ No, lad; teach me.[2868]

    _Fool._ That lord that counsell'd thee[2871][2872][2873]         135
              To give away thy land,[2872][2873]
            Come place him here by me;[2872][2873]
              Do thou for him stand:[2872][2873][2874]
            The sweet and bitter fool[2872][2873]
              Will presently appear;[2872][2873]
            The one in motley here,[2872][2873]                      140
              The other found out there.[2872][2873]

    _Lear._ Dost thou call me fool, boy?[2872][2875]

    _Fool._ All thy other titles thou hast given away; that[2872]
    thou wast born with.[2872]                                       145

    _Kent._ This is not altogether fool, my lord.[2872]

    _Fool._ No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if[2872]
    I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't: and[2872][2876][2877]
    ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool to
        myself;[2872][2877][2878]
    they'll be snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give[2872][2879]  150
    thee two crowns.

    _Lear._ What two crowns shall they be?

    _Fool._ Why, after I have cut the egg in the middle and[2880]
    eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
    clovest thy crown i' the middle and gavest away both parts,[2881]  155
    thou borest thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt: thou hadst[2882]
    little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden
    one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped[2883]
    that first finds it so.[2884]
    [_Singing_] Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;[2885][2886]      160
                  For wise men are grown foppish,
                And know not how their wits to wear,[2887]
                  Their manners are so apish.

    _Lear._ When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?[2888]

    _Fool._ I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy[2889]  165
    daughters thy mother: for when thou gavest them the rod[2890]
    and puttest down thine own breeches,
    [_Singing_] Then they for sudden joy did weep,[2885][2891][2892]
                  And I for sorrow sung,[2892]
                That such a king should play bo-peep,[2892]          170
                  And go the fools among.[2892][2893]

    Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy
    fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.[2894]

    _Lear._ An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.[2895]

    _Fool._ I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:            175
    they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt have me[2896]
    whipped for lying, and sometimes I am whipped for holding[2897]
    my peace. I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool:[2898]
    and yet I would not be thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy
    wit o' both sides and left nothing i' the middle. Here comes[2899]  180
    one o' the parings.[2898][2900]

                            _Enter_ GONERIL.

    _Lear._ How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?[2901][2902][2903]
    Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.[2902][2904]

    _Fool._ Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no
    need to care for her frowning; now thou art an O without[2905]   185
    a figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool, thou
    art nothing. [_To Gon._] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my[2906]
    tongue; so your face bids me, though you say nothing.

            Mum, mum:[2907]
            He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,[2908]                 190
            Weary of all, shall want some.
    [_Pointing to Lear_] That's a shealed peascod.[2909]

    _Gon._ Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,[2910][2911]
    But other of your insolent retinue[2910][2912]
    Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth[2910]                 195
    In rank and not to be endured riots. Sir,[2910][2913]
    I had thought, by making this well known unto you,[2910][2914]
    To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,[2910]
    By what yourself too late have spoke and done,[2910]
    That you protect this course and put it on[2910][2915]           200
    By your allowance; which if you should, the fault[2910][2916][2917]
    Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,[2910][2917][2918]
    Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,[2910]
    Might in their working do you that offence[2910]
    Which else were shame, that then necessity[2910][2919]           205
    Will call discreet proceeding.[2910][2920]

    _Fool._ For, you know, nuncle,[2921]
            The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,[2922]
            That it had it head bit off by it young.[2922][2923]
    So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.               210

    _Lear._ Are you our daughter?

    _Gon._ Come, sir,[2924]
    I would you would make use of that good wisdom[2925][2926]
    Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away[2925][2927]
    These dispositions that of late transform you[2925][2928]        215
    From what you rightly are.[2925]

    _Fool._ May not an ass know when the cart draws the
    horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.

    _Lear._ Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:[2929][2930]
    Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?[2931]       220
    Either his notion weakens, his discernings[2932]
    Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.[2933]
    Who is it that can tell me who I am?[2929][2934]

    _Fool._ Lear's shadow.[2935]

    _Lear._ I would learn that; for, by the marks of[2936][2937]     225
    sovereignty knowledge and reason, I should be false[2936][2938]
    persuaded I had daughters.[2936]

    _Fool._ Which they will make an obedient father.[2936][2939][2940]

    _Lear._ Your name, fair gentlewoman?[2939]

    _Gon._ This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour[2941][2942]   230
    Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you[2941]
    To understand my purposes aright:[2941][2943]
    As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.[2941][2944]
    Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;[2941][2945]
    Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,[2941][2946]             235
    That this our court, infected with their manners,[2941]
    Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust[2941][2947]
    Make it more like a tavern or a brothel[2941][2948]
    Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak[2941][2949]
    For instant remedy: be then desired[2941][2950]                  240
    By her that else will take the thing she begs[2941]
    A little to disquantity your train,[2941][2951]
    And the remainder that shall still depend,[2941][2952]
    To be such men as may besort your age,[2941]
    Which know themselves and you.[2941][2953]

    _Lear._                        Darkness and devils![2941]        245
    Saddle my horses; call my train together.[2941]
    Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee:[2941]
    Yet have I left a daughter.[2941]

    _Gon._ You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble[2954]
    Make servants of their betters.[2954]                            250

                         _Enter_ ALBANY.[2955]

    _Lear._ Woe, that too late repents,--[_To Alb._] O, sir,
             are you come?[2956]
    Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.[2957]
    Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
    More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
    Than the sea-monster![2958]

    _Alb._                Pray, sir, be patient.[2959][2960]         255

    _Lear._ [_To Gon._] Detested kite! thou liest.[2959][2961][2962]
    My train are men of choice and rarest parts,[2962]
    That all particulars of duty know,
    And in the most exact regard support
    The worships of their name. O most small fault,[2963]            260
    How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
    That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature[2964]
    From the fix'd place, drew from my heart all love
    And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear![2965]
    Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in [_Striking his head._[2966]  265
    And thy dear judgement out! Go, go, my people.[2967]

    _Alb._ My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant[2968]
    Of what hath moved you.[2969]

    _Lear._                 It may be so, my lord.[2970]
    Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear![2970][2971]
    Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend[2970]                  270
    To make this creature fruitful:[2970]
    Into her womb convey sterility:
    Dry up in her the organs of increase,
    And from her derogate body never spring[2972]
    A babe to honour her! If she must teem,                          275
    Create her child of spleen, that it may live
    And be a thwart disnatured torment to her.[2973]
    Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
    With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;[2974]
    Turn all her mother's pains and benefits[2975]                   280
    To laughter and contempt; that she may feel[2976]
    How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
    To have a thankless child! Away, away!                [_Exit._[2977]

    _Alb._ Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?[2978]

    _Gon._ Never afflict yourself to know the cause,[2979]           285
    But let his disposition have that scope
    That dotage gives it.

                         _Re-enter_ LEAR.[2980]

    _Lear._ What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
    Within a fortnight!

    _Alb._              What's the matter, sir?[2981]

    _Lear._ I'll tell thee. [_To Gon._] Life and death! I am
            ashamed[2982]                                            290
    That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
    That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,[2983]
    Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee![2984][2985]
    The untented woundings of a father's curse[2985]
    Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,[2986]              295
    Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out[2987]
    And cast you with the waters that you lose,[2988]
    To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?[2989]
    Let it be so: yet have I left a daughter,[2990]
    Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:[2991]                   300
    When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
    She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find[2992]
    That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
    I have cast off for ever: thou shalt, I warrant thee.

                            [_Exeunt Lear, Kent, and Attendants._[2993]

    _Gon._ Do you mark that, my lord?[2994]                          305

    _Alb._ I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
    To the great love I bear you,--[2995][2996]

    _Gon._ Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho![2995][2997][2998]
    [_To the Fool_] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your
        master.[2995][2997][2999]

    _Fool_. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry; take the fool[3000][3001]  310
    with thee.[3000][3002]

                A fox, when one has caught her,[3002]
                And such a daughter,
                Should sure to the slaughter,
                If my cap would buy a halter:[3003]                  315
                So the fool follows after.                [_Exit._[3004]

    _Gon_. This man hath had good counsel: a hundred knights![3005][3006]
    'Tis politic and safe to let him keep[3005][3007]
    At point a hundred knights: yes, that on every dream,[3008]
    Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,                  320
    He may enguard his dotage with their powers
    And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say![3009]

    _Alb._ Well, you may fear too far.

    _Gon._                             Safer than trust too far:[3010]
    Let me still take away the harms I fear,
    Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.[3011]              325
    What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister:
    If she sustain him and his hundred knights,[3012]
    When I have show'd the unfitness,--

                        _Re-enter_ OSWALD.[3013]

                                             How now, Oswald![3014]
    What, have you writ that letter to my sister?[3014][3015]

    _Osw._ Yes, madam.[3016]                                         330

    _Gon._ Take you some company, and away to horse:[3017]
    Inform her full of my particular fear,[3018]
    And thereto add such reasons of your own
    As may compact it more. Get you gone;[3019]
    And hasten your return. [_Exit Oswald._] No, no, my lord,[3020]  335
    This milky gentleness and course of yours[3021]
    Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,[3022]
    You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom[3023]
    Than praised for harmful mildness.[3024]

    _Alb._ How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell:[3025]         340
    Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.[3025][3026]

    _Gon._ Nay, then--[3027]

    _Alb._ Well, well; the event.                       [_Exeunt._[3028]


SCENE V. _Court before the same._

                 _Enter_ LEAR, KENT, _and_ Fool.[3029]

    _Lear._ Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.[3030]
    Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you know
    than comes from her demand out of the letter. If your diligence
    be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.[3031]

    _Kent._ I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered           5
    your letter.                                                [_Exit._

    _Fool._ If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in[3032]
    danger of kibes?

    _Lear._ Ay, boy.

    _Fool._ Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go[3033]   10
    slip-shod.

    _Lear._ Ha, ha, ha!

    _Fool._ Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
    for though she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I[3034]
    can tell what I can tell.[3035]                                   15

    _Lear._ Why, what canst thou tell, boy?[3036]

    _Fool._ She will taste as like this as a crab does to a[3037]
    crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i' the middle[3038]
    on's face?[3039]

    _Lear._ No.                                                       20

    _Fool._ Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose,[3040]
    that what a man cannot smell out he may spy into.[3041]

    _Lear._ I did her wrong--[3042]

    _Fool._ Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?[3043]

    _Lear._ No.                                                       25

    _Fool._ Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a
    house.

    _Lear._ Why?

    _Fool._ Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his[3044]
    daughters, and leave his horns without a case.[3045]              30

    _Lear._ I will forget my nature.--So kind a father!--Be
    my horses ready?

    _Fool._ Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why[3046]
    the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.[3047]

    _Lear._ Because they are not eight?[3048]                         35

    _Fool._ Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.[3049]

    _Lear._ To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude![3050]

    _Fool._ If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten[3051]
    for being old before thy time.

    _Lear._ How's that?                                               40

    _Fool._ Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst[3052]
    been wise.

    _Lear._ O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven![3053][3054]
    Keep me in temper: I would not be mad![3053]

                        _Enter_ Gentleman.[3055]

    How now! are the horses ready?[3056]                              45

    _Gent._ Ready, my lord.[3057]

    _Lear._ Come, boy.[3058]

    _Fool._ She that's a maid now and laughs at my departure[3059]
    Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.[3060]

                                                              [_Exeunt._

SCENE I. _The Earl of Gloucester's castle._

              _Enter_ EDMUND _and_ CURAN, _meeting_.[3061]

    _Edm._ Save thee, Curan.[3062]

    _Cur._ And you, sir. I have been with your father, and[3063][3064]
    given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his[3063][3065]
    duchess will be here with him this night.[3063][3066]

    _Edm._ How comes that?[3062]                                       5

    _Cur._ Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news
    abroad, I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but[3067]
    ear-kissing arguments?[3068]

    _Edm._ Not I: pray you, what are they?[3069]

    _Cur._ Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt[3070][3071][3072]  10
    the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?[3070][3071][3073]

    _Edm._ Not a word.[3070]

    _Cur._ You may do then in time. Fare you well, sir.   [_Exit._[3074]

    _Edm._ The duke be here to-night? The better! best![3075][3076][3077]
    This weaves itself perforce into my business.[3076]               15
    My father hath set guard to take my brother;[3076]
    And I have one thing, of a queasy question,[3076][3078]
    Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work![3076][3079]
    Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say![3076]

                          _Enter_ EDGAR.[3080]

    My father watches: O sir, fly this place;[3076][3081]             20
    Intelligence is given where you are hid;[3076]
    You have now the good advantage of the night:[3076][3082]
    Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?[3076][3083]
    He's coming hither, now, i' the night, i' the haste,[3076][3084]
    And Regan with him: have you nothing said[3076]                   25
    Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?[3076][3085]
    Advise yourself.[3076][3086]

    _Edg._           I am sure on't, not a word.[3076]

    _Edm._ I hear my father coming: pardon me:[3076][3087]
    In cunning I must draw my sword upon you:[3076][3087]
    Draw: seem to defend yourself: now quit you well.[3076][3088]     30
    Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here![3076][3089]
    Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So farewell.

                                             [_Exit Edgar._[3076][3090]

    Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion

                                         [_Wounds his arm._[3076][3091]

    Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards[3076][3092]
    Do more than this in sport. Father, father![3076][3093]           35
    Stop, stop! No help?[3076]

        _Enter_ GLOUCESTER, _and_ Servants _with torches_.[3094]

    _Glou._ Now, Edmund, where's the villain?[3076][3095]

    _Edm._ Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,[3076]
    Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon[3076][3096]
    To stand 's auspicious mistress.[3076]

    _Glou._                          But where is he?[3076]           40

    _Edm._ Look, sir, I bleed.[3076]

    _Glou._                    Where is the villain, Edmund?[3076][3097]

    _Edm._ Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--[3076][3098]

    _Glou._ Pursue him, ho!--Go after.  [_Exeunt some
        Servants._]  'By no means' what?[3076][3099]

    _Edm._ Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;[3076]
    But that I told him the revenging gods[3076][3100]                45
    'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend,[3076][3101]
    Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond[3076]
    The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,[3076][3102]
    Seeing how loathly opposite I stood[3076]
    To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion[3076][3103]              50
    With his prepared sword he charges home[3076]
    My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:[3076][3104]
    But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits[3076][3105]
    Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,[3076][3106]
    Or whether gasted by the noise I made,[3076][3107]                55
    Full suddenly he fled.[3076][3108]

    _Glou._                Let him fly far:[3076]
    Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;[3076]
    And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,[3076][3109]
    My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:[3076][3110]
    By his authority I will proclaim it,[3076]                        60
    That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,[3076][3111]
    Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;[3076][3112]
    He that conceals him, death.[3076][3113]

    _Edm._ When I dissuaded him from his intent[3076]
    And found him pight to do it, with curst speech[3076]             65
    I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,[3076]
    'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,[3076]
    If I would stand against thee, could the reposure[3076][3114][3115]
    Of any trust, virtue, or worth, in thee[3076][3114]
    Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny--[3076][3114][3116]  70
    As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce[3076][3117]
    My very character--I'ld turn it all[3076][3118]
    To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:[3076][3119]
    And thou must make a dullard of the world,[3076][3120]
    If they not thought the profits of my death[3076]                 75
    Were very pregnant and potential spurs[3076][3121]
    To make thee seek it.'[3076]

    _Glou._                Strong and fasten'd villain![3076][3122]
    Would he deny his letter? I never got him.[3076][3123]

                                                       [_Tucket within._

    Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.[3076][3124]
    All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;[3076]           80
    The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture[3076]
    I will send far and near, that all the kingdom[3076]
    May have due note of him; and of my land,[3076][3125]
    Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means[3076]
    To make thee capable.[3076]                                       85

            _Enter_ CORNWALL, REGAN, _and_ Attendants.[3126]

    _Corn._ How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,[3076][3127]
    Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.[3076][3128]

    _Reg._ If it be true, all vengeance comes too short[3076]
    Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?[3076][3129]

    _Glou._ O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, is crack'd![3076][3130]  90

    _Reg._ What, did my father's godson seek your life?[3076]
    He whom my father named? your Edgar?[3076][3131]

    _Glou._ O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid![3076][3132]

    _Reg._ Was he not companion with the riotous knights[3076][3133]
    That tend upon my father?[3076][3134]                             95

    _Glou._ I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.[3076][3135]

    _Edm._ Yes, madam, he was of that consort.[3076][3136]

    _Reg._ No marvel then, though he were ill affected:
    'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
    To have the waste and spoil of his revenues.[3137]               100
    I have this present evening from my sister
    Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions
    That if they come to sojourn at my house,[3138]
    I'll not be there.[3138]

    _Corn._            Nor I, assure thee, Regan.[3139][3140]
    Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father[3139][3141]       105
    A child-like office.[3139]

    _Edm._               'Twas my duty, sir.[3142]

    _Glou._ He did bewray his practice, and received[3143]
    This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

    _Corn._ Is he pursued?

    _Glou._                Ay, my good lord.[3144]

    _Corn._ If he be taken, he shall never more[3145]                110
    Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,[3145]
    How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,[3145][3146]
    Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant[3145][3147]
    So much commend itself, you shall be ours:[3145][3148]
    Natures of such deep trust we shall much need:[3145][3149]       115
    You we first seize on.[3145][3149]

    _Edm._                 I shall serve you, sir,[3150][3151]
    Truly, however else.[3150]

    _Glou._              For him I thank your grace.[3152]

    _Corn._ You know not why we came to visit you,--[3153]

    _Reg._ Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:[3154]
    Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,[3155]                120
    Wherein we must have use of your advice:[3156]
    Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
    Of differences, which I least thought it fit[3157]
    To answer from our home; the several messengers[3158]
    From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,                 125
    Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow[3159]
    Your needful counsel to our business,[3159][3160]
    Which craves the instant use.[3159][3161]

    _Glou._                       I serve you, madam:[3162]
    Your graces are right welcome.      [_Flourish. Exeunt._[3162][3163]


SCENE II. _Before Gloucester's castle._

             _Enter_ KENT _and_ OSWALD, _severally_.[3164]

    _Osw._ Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?[3165][3166]

    _Kent._ Ay.

    _Osw._ Where may we set our horses?

    _Kent._ I' the mire.[3167]

    _Osw._ Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.[3168]                  5

    _Kent._ I love thee not.

    _Osw._ Why then I care not for thee.

    _Kent._ If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make[3169]
    thee care for me.

    _Osw._ Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.                10

    _Kent._ Fellow, I know thee.

    _Osw._ What dost thou know me for?

    _Kent._ A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
    base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound,[3170]
    filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking[3171]  15
    knave; a whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical[3172]
    rogue; one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a[3173]
    bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition
    of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son
    and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I will beat into[3174]      20
    clamorous whining, if thou deniest the least syllable of thy[3175]
    addition.

    _Osw._ Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to[3176]
    rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee![3177]

    _Kent._ What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny              25
    thou knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up[3178][3179]
    thy heels and beat thee before the king? Draw, you rogue:[3179]
    for, though it be night, yet the moon shines; I'll make a[3180]
    sop o' the moonshine of you: draw, you whoreson cullionly[3181]
    barber-monger, draw.                 [_Drawing his sword._[3182]  30

    _Osw._ Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

    _Kent._ Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against[3183]
    the king, and take vanity the puppet's part against the
    royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado[3184]
    your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.[3185]              35

    _Osw._ Help, ho! murder! help!

    _Kent._ Strike, you slave; stand, rogue; stand, you neat[3186]
    slave, strike.                                 [_Beating him._[3187]

    _Osw._ Help, ho! murder! murder!

       _Enter_ EDMUND, _with his rapier drawn_, CORNWALL, REGAN,
                   GLOUCESTER, _and_ Servants.[3188]

    _Edm._ How now! What's the matter? [_Parting them._[3189][3190][3191]  40

    _Kent._ With you, goodman boy, an you please: come,[3192]
    I'll flesh you; come on, young master.[3193]

    _Glou._ Weapons! arms! What's the matter here?[3194]

    _Corn._ Keep peace, upon your lives;[3195]
    He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?[3195][3196]       45

    _Reg._ The messengers from our sister and the king.[3197]

    _Corn._ What is your difference? speak.[3198]

    _Osw._ I am scarce in breath, my lord.

    _Kent._ No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour.[3199]
    You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a tailor made[3199][3200]  50
    thee.[3199]

    _Corn._ Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?[3199][3201]

    _Kent._ Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or a painter[3202]
    could not have made him so ill, though he had been but[3203]
    two hours at the trade.[3204]                                     55

    _Corn._ Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?[3205]

    _Osw._ This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared[3206]
    at suit of his gray beard,--[3207]

    _Kent._ Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter![3208]
    My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this[3209]       60
    unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the walls of a jakes[3210]
    with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?[3211]

    _Corn._ Peace, sirrah![3212][3213]
    You beastly knave, know you no reverence?[3212][3214]

    _Kent._ Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.[3215]               65

    _Corn._ Why art thou angry?

    _Kent._ That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
    Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,[3216]
    Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain[3217]
    Which are too intrinse to unloose; smooth every passion[3218]     70
    That in the natures of their lords rebel;[3219]
    Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;[3220]
    Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks[3221]
    With every gale and vary of their masters,[3222]
    Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.[3223][3224]             75
    A plague upon your epileptic visage![3223]
    Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?[3223][3225]
    Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,[3226]
    I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.[3227]

    _Corn._ What, art thou mad, old fellow?[3228]                     80

    _Glou._ How fell you out? say that.[3228][3229]

    _Kent._ No contraries hold more antipathy
    Than I and such a knave.

    _Corn._ Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?[3230]

    _Kent._ His countenance likes me not.                             85

    _Corn._ No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.[3231]

    _Kent._ Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
    I have seen better faces in my time
    Than stands on any shoulders that I see[3232]
    Before me at this instant.

    _Corn._                    This is some fellow,[3233][3234]       90
    Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect[3233]
    A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb[3233][3235]
    Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,--[3233][3236]
    An honest mind and plain,--he must speak truth![3233][3237]
    An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.[3233][3238]         95
    These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness[3233][3239]
    Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends[3233][3240]
    Than twenty silly ducking observants[3233][3241]
    That stretch their duties nicely.[3233]

    _Kent._ Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,[3242]             100
    Under the allowance of your great aspect,[3243]
    Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
    On flickering Phœbus' front,--

    _Corn._                           What mean'st by this?[3244]

    _Kent._ To go out of my dialect, which you discommend[3245]
    so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled[3246]  105
    you in a plain accent was a plain knave; which, for my
    part, I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to[3247]
    entreat me to't.[3247][3248]

    _Corn._ What was the offence you gave him?[3249]

    _Osw._ I never gave him any:[3250][3251]                         110
    It pleased the king his master very late[3251][3252]
    To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;[3251][3253]
    When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,[3254]
    Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
    And put upon him such a deal of man,[3255]                       115
    That worthied him, got praises of the king[3255]
    For him attempting who was self-subdued;
    And in the fleshment of this dread exploit[3256]
    Drew on me here again.[3257]

    _Kent._                None of these rogues and cowards[3258]
    But Ajax is their fool.[3258][3259]

    _Corn._                 Fetch forth the stocks!                  120
    You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,[3260]
    We'll teach you--[3261]

    _Kent._           Sir, I am too old to learn:[3262]
    Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king,[3262]
    On whose employment I was sent to you:[3262][3263]
    You shall do small respect, show too bold malice[3264]           125
    Against the grace and person of my master,
    Stocking his messenger.[3265]

    _Corn._ Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,[3266][3267]
    There shall he sit till noon.[3266]

    _Reg._ Till noon! till night, my lord, and all night too.[3268]  130

    _Kent._ Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,[3269]
    You should not use me so.[3269][3270]

    _Reg._                    Sir, being his knave, I will.

    _Corn._ This is a fellow of the self-same colour[3271]
    Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!

                                           [_Stocks brought out._[3272]

    _Glou._ Let me beseech your grace not to do so:                  135
    His fault is much, and the good king his master[3273]
    Will check him for't: your purposed low correction[3273]
    Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches[3273][3274]
    For pilferings and most common trespasses[3273]
    Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,[3273]              140
    That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,[3273][3275]
    Should have him thus restrain'd.[3273][3275]

    _Corn._                          I'll answer that.

    _Reg._ My sister may receive it much more worse,[3276]
    To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,[3277]
    For following her affairs. Put in his legs.[3278]                145

                                     [_Kent is put in the stocks._[3279]

    Come, my good lord, away.                [_Exeunt all but Gloucester
                                                        and Kent._[3280]

    _Glou._ I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,[3281]
    Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
    Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.[3282]

    _Kent._ Pray, do not, sir: I have watch'd and travell'd
              hard;[3283]                                            150
    Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.[3284]
    A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
    Give you good morrow!

    _Glou._ The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.

    _Kent._ Good king, that must approve the common saw,             155
    Thou out of heaven's benediction comest[3286]
    To the warm sun!
    Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,[3287][3288]
    That by thy comfortable beams I may[3287]
    Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles[3287][3289]     160
    But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,[3287][3290]
    Who hath most fortunately been inform'd[3287][3291]
    Of my obscured course; and shall find time[3287][3292][3293]
    From this enormous state, seeking to give[3287][3293][3294]
    Losses their remedies. All weary and o'er-watch'd,[3287][3295]   165
    Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold[3296]

SCENE III. _A wood._

                          _Enter_ EDGAR.[3299]

    _Edg._ I heard myself proclaim'd;[3300]
    And by the happy hollow of a tree
    Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
    That guard and most unusual vigilance[3301]
    Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape[3302]               5
    I will preserve myself: and am bethought
    To take the basest and most poorest shape[3303]
    That ever penury in contempt of man
    Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth,
    Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,[3304]                 10
    And with presented nakedness out-face
    The winds and persecutions of the sky.[3305]
    The country gives me proof and precedent[3306]
    Of Bedlam beggars, who with roaring voices
    Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms[3307]              15
    Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;[3308]
    And with this horrible object, from low farms,[3309]
    Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes and mills,[3310]
    Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,[3311]
    Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom![3312]             20
    That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.                   [_Exit._


SCENE IV. _Before Gloucester's castle. Kent in the stocks._

               _Enter_ LEAR, Fool, _and_ Gentleman.[3313]

    _Lear._ 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,[3314]
    And not send back my messenger.[3315]

    _Gent._                         As I learn'd,[3316]
    The night before there was no purpose in them[3316][3317]
    Of this remove.[3316][3318]

    _Kent._         Hail to thee, noble master!

    _Lear._ Ha![3319][3320]                                            5
    Makest thou this shame thy pastime?[3320]

    _Kent._                             No, my lord.[3321]

    _Fool._ Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied[3322][3323]
    by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the[3322][3324]
    loins, and men by the legs: when a man's over-lusty at[3322][3325]
    legs, then he wears wooden nether-stocks.[3322][3326]             10

    _Lear._ What's he that hath so much thy place mistook[3327]
    To set thee here?[3327]

    _Kent._           It is both he and she;[3328]
    Your son and daughter.[3328]

    _Lear._ No.

    _Kent._ Yes.                                                      15

    _Lear._ No, I say.

    _Kent._ I say, yea.[3329]

    _Lear._ No, no, they would not.[3330]

    _Kent._ Yes, they have.[3330]

    _Lear._ By Jupiter, I swear, no.                                  20

    _Kent._ By Juno, I swear, ay.[3331]

    _Lear._                       They durst not do't;[3332]
    They could not, would not do't; 'tis worse than murder,[3332][3333]
    To do upon respect such violent outrage:
    Resolve me with all modest haste which way
    Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,[3334]           25
    Coming from us.

    _Kent._         My lord, when at their home
    I did commend your highness' letters to them,
    Ere I was risen from the place that show'd[3335]
    My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,[3336]
    Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth[3337]         30
    From Goneril his mistress salutations;[3338]
    Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,[3339]
    Which presently they read: on whose contents[3340]
    They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;[3341]
    Commanded me to follow and attend                                 35
    The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
    And meeting here the other messenger,[3342]
    Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine--
    Being the very fellow that of late[3343]
    Display'd so saucily against your highness--                      40
    Having more man than wit about me, drew:[3344]
    He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
    Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
    The shame which here it suffers.[3345]

    _Fool._ Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that
        way.[3346][3347]                                              45
                Fathers that wear rags[3346][3348]
                  Do make their children blind;[3346][3348]
                But fathers that bear bags[3346][3348]
                  Shall see their children kind.[3346][3348]
                Fortune, that arrant whore,[3346][3348]               50
                Ne'er turns the key to the poor.[3346][3348]
    But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy[3346][3349][3350]
    daughters as thou canst tell in a year.[3346][3349]

    _Lear._ O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
    Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,[3351]               55
    Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?

    _Kent._ With the earl, sir, here within.[3352][3353]

    _Lear._ Follow me not; stay here.               [_Exit._[3352][3354]

    _Gent._ Made you no more offence but what you speak of?[3355]

    _Kent._ None.[3356][3357]                                         60
    How chance the king comes with so small a train?[3357][3358]

    _Fool._ An thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that[3359][3360]
    question, thou hadst well deserved it.[3361]

    _Kent._ Why, fool?

    _Fool._ We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee         65
    there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow their[3360][3362]
    noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and there's not[3362]
    a nose among twenty but can smell him that's stinking. Let[3363]
    go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it
    break thy neck with following it; but the great one that[3364]    70
    goes up the hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man[3365]
    gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I would have
    none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
            That sir which serves and seeks for gain,[3366][3367]
              And follows but for form,[3367]                         75
            Will pack when it begins to rain,[3367][3368]
              And leave thee in the storm.[3367][3369]
            But I will tarry; the fool will stay,[3367][3370]
              And let the wise man fly:[3367][3371]
            The knave turns fool that runs away;[3367][3372]          80
              The fool no knave, perdy.[3367][3372]

    _Kent._ Where learned you this, fool?

    _Fool._ Not i' the stocks, fool.[3360][3373]

               _Re-enter_ LEAR, _with_ GLOUCESTER.[3374]

    _Lear._ Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?[3375]
    They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;[3376][3377]      85
    The images of revolt and flying off.[3377][3378]
    Fetch me a better answer.[3379]

    _Glou._                   My dear lord,[3380]
    You know the fiery quality of the duke;[3380]
    How unremoveable and fix'd he is[3380]
    In his own course.[3380]                                          90

    _Lear._ Vengeance! plague! death! confusion![3380][3381]
    Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,[3380][3382]
    I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.[3380]

    _Glou._ Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.[3383]

    _Lear._ Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?[3383]        95

    _Glou._ Ay, my good lord.

    _Lear._ The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father[3384]
    Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:[3385]
    Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood![3386]
    'Fiery'? 'the fiery duke'? Tell the hot duke that--[3387]        100
    No, but not yet: may be he is not well:[3388]
    Infirmity doth still neglect all office[3389]
    Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves[3389][3390]
    When nature being oppress'd commands the mind[3389][3391]
    To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;[3389]                     105
    And am fall'n out with my more headier will,[3392]
    To take the indisposed and sickly fit[3393]
    For the sound man.  [_Looking on Kent_]  Death on my
              state! wherefore[3393][3394]
    Should he sit here? This act persuades me[3393][3395]
    That this remotion of the duke and her[3393]                     110
    Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.[3396]
    Go tell the duke and's wife I'ld speak with them,[3397]
    Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
    Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
    Till it cry sleep to death.[3398]                                115

    _Glou._ I would have all well betwixt you.            [_Exit._[3399]

    _Lear._ O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down![3400]

    _Fool._ Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels[3401]
    when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em o' the[3402]
    coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down, wantons, down!'          120
    'Twas her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse, buttered[3403]
    his hay.

  _Re-enter_ GLOUCESTER, _with_ CORNWALL, REGAN, _and_ Servants.[3404]

    _Lear._ Good morrow to you both.

    _Corn._                               Hail to your grace!

                                        [_Kent is set at liberty._[3405]

    _Reg._ I am glad to see your highness.

    _Lear._ Regan, I think you are; I know what reason[3406]         125
    I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,[3407]
    I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,[3408]
    Sepulchring an adultress. [_To Kent_] O, are you free?[3409]
    Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
    Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied[3410][3411]          130
    Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:[3410]

                                           [_Points to his heart._[3412]

    I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe[3413]
    With how depraved a quality--O Regan![3414]

    _Reg._ I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope[3415]
    You less know how to value her desert                            135
    Than she to scant her duty.[3416]

    _Lear._                     Say, how is that?[3417][3418]

    _Reg._ I cannot think my sister in the least[3417]
    Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance[3417][3419]
    She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,[3417]
    'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end[3417]              140
    As clears her from all blame.[3417]

    _Lear._ My curses on her!

    _Reg._                    O, sir, you are old;
    Nature in you stands on the very verge[3420][3421]
    Of her confine: you should be ruled and led[3420][3422]
    By some discretion that discerns your state[3420]                145
    Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you[3420][3423]
    That to our sister you do make return;[3420]
    Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

    _Lear._                        Ask her forgiveness?[3424]
    Do you but mark how this becomes the house:[3425]
    [Kneeling] 'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;[3426]        150
    Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
    That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed and food.'

    _Reg._ Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
    Return you to my sister.

    _Lear._       [_Rising_] Never, Regan:[3427]
    She hath abated me of half my train;                             155
    Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,[3428]
    Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
    All the stored vengeances of heaven fall[3429]
    On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,[3429][3430]
    You taking airs, with lameness.[3429]

    _Corn._                         Fie, sir, fie![3431]             160

    _Lear._ You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames[3432]
    Into her scornful eyes. Infect her beauty,
    You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun[3433]
    To fall and blast her pride.[3433][3434]

    _Reg._ O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,[3435]           165
    When the rash mood is on.[3435][3436]

    _Lear._ No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
    Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give[3437][3438]
    Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce, but thine[3438][3439]
    Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee[3438]                  170
    To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,[3438]
    To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
    And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
    Against my coming in: thou better know'st[3440]
    The offices of nature, bond of childhood,                        175
    Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;[3441]
    Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,[3442]
    Wherein I thee endow'd.

    _Reg._                  Good sir, to the purpose.[3443]

    _Lear._ Who put my man i' the stocks?        [_Tucket within._[3444]

    _Corn._                               What trumpet's that?

    _Reg._ I know't; my sister's: this approves her letter,[3445]    180
    That she would soon be here.

                         _Enter_ OSWALD.[3446]

                                 Is your lady come?

    _Lear._ This is a slave whose easy-borrow'd pride[3447]
    Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.[3448]
    Out, varlet, from my sight!

    _Corn._                     What means your grace?

    _Lear._ Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope[3449]    185
    Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here?

                         _Enter_ GONERIL.[3450]

                                              O heavens,
    If you do love old men, if your sweet sway[3451][3452]
    Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,[3451][3453]
    Make it your cause; send down, and take my part![3451]
    [_To Gon._] Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?[3454]       190
    O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?[3455]

    _Gon._ Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
    All's not offence that indiscretion finds[3456]
    And dotage terms so.

    _Lear._              O sides, you are too tough;
    Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?[3457]          195

    _Corn._ I set him there, sir: but his own disorders[3458]
    Deserved much less advancement.[3459]

    _Lear._                         You! did you?

    _Reg._ I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.[3460]
    If, till the expiration of your month,[3461]
    You will return and sojourn with my sister,                      200
    Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
    I am now from home and out of that provision[3462]
    Which shall be needful for your entertainment.

    _Lear._ Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
    No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose                        205
    To wage against the enmity o' the air,[3463][3464]
    To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--[3463][3465]
    Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
    Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took[3466][3467]
    Our youngest born, I could as well be brought[3467]              210
    To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg[3468]
    To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
    Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
    To this detested groom.                 [_Pointing at Oswald._[3469]

    _Gon._                  At your choice, sir.

    _Lear._ I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:[3470]           215
    I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
    We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
    But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
    Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,[3471]
    Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,[3472]             220
    A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,[3473][3474]
    In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;[3473]
    Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:[3475]
    I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,[3476]
    Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:[3477]               225
    Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
    I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
    I and my hundred knights.

    _Reg._                       Not altogether so:[3478][3479]
    I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided[3478][3480]
    For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;[3478][3481]   230
    For those that mingle reason with your passion[3478][3482]
    Must be content to think you old, and so--[3483]
    But she knows what she does.

    _Lear._                      Is this well spoken?[3484]

    _Reg._ I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?[3485]
    Is it not well? What should you need of more?                    235
    Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger[3486]
    Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house[3487]
    Should many people under two commands
    Hold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible.[3488]

    _Gon._ Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance            240
    From those that she calls servants or from mine?

    _Reg._ Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,[3489]
    We could control them. If you will come to me,[3490]
    For now I spy a danger, I entreat you[3491]
    To bring but five and twenty: to no more[3492]                   245
    Will I give place or notice.

    _Lear._ I gave you all--[3493]

    _Reg._                   And in good time you gave it.

    _Lear._ Made you my guardians, my depositaries,
    But kept a reservation to be follow'd[3494]
    With such a number. What, must I come to you[3495]               250
    With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?[3496]

    _Reg._ And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.[3497]

    _Lear._ Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,[3498][3499]
    When others are more wicked; not being the worst[3498][3500]
    Stands in some rank of praise. [_To Gon._] I'll go with
              thee:[3501]                                            255
    Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
    And thou art twice her love.[3502]

    _Gon._                       Hear me, my lord:
    What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
    To follow in a house where twice so many
    Have a command to tend you?

    _Reg._                      What need one?[3503]                 260

    _Lear._ O, reason not the need: our basest beggars[3504]
    Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
    Allow not nature more than nature needs,
    Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;[3505]
    If only to go warm were gorgeous,                                265
    Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,[3506]
    Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But for true need,--[3507]
    You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need![3508]
    You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,[3509]
    As full of grief as age; wretched in both:                       270
    If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts[3510]
    Against their father, fool me not so much[3511]
    To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,[3512]
    And let not women's weapons, water-drops,[3513]
    Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,                   275
    I will have such revenges on you both[3514]
    That all the world shall--I will do such things,--[3515]
    What they are, yet I know not, but they shall be
    The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;[3516]
    No, I'll not weep:[3517]                                         280
    I have full cause of weeping; but this heart[3517][3518]
    Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,[3517][3519]
    Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!

                      [_Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool._[3520]

    _Corn._ Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.

                                      [_Storm and tempest._[3521][3522]

    _Reg._ This house is little: the old man and his people[3522][3523]  285
    Cannot be well bestow'd.[3522][3524]

    _Gon._ 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,[3522][3525]
    And must needs taste his folly.[3522][3526]

    _Reg._ For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
    But not one follower.

    _Gon._                So am I purposed.[3527][3528]              290
    Where is my lord of Gloucester?[3528]

    _Corn._ Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.[3529]

                         _Re-enter_ GLOUCESTER.

    _Glou._ The king is in high rage.

    _Corn._                           Whither is he going?[3530][3531]

    _Glou._ He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.[3530][3532]

    _Corn._ 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.[3533]       295

    _Gon._ My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

    _Glou._ Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds[3534]
    Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about[3535][3536]
    There's scarce a bush.[3535][3537]

    _Reg._                 O, sir, to wilful men
    The injuries that they themselves procure                        300
    Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
    He is attended with a desperate train;
    And what they may incense him to, being apt[3538]
    To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.

    _Corn._ Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:[3539]    305
    My Regan counsels well: come out o' the storm.      [_Exeunt._[3540]

ACT III.


SCENE I. _A heath._

     _Storm still. Enter_ KENT _and a_ Gentleman, _meeting_.[3541]

    _Kent._ Who's there, besides foul weather?[3542]

    _Gent._ One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

    _Kent._ I know you. Where's the king?

    _Gent._ Contending with the fretful elements;[3543]
    Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,                         5
    Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,[3544]
    That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,[3545]
    Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,[3545]
    Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;[3545]
    Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn[3545][3546][3547]  10
    The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.[3545][3546][3548]
    This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,[3545][3549]
    The lion and the belly-pinched wolf[3545][3550]
    Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,[3545]
    And bids what will take all.[3545]

    _Kent._                      But who is with him?                 15

    _Gent._ None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
    His heart-struck injuries.[3551]

    _Kent._                    Sir, I do know you;
    And dare, upon the warrant of my note,[3552]
    Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,[3553]
    Although as yet the face of it be cover'd[3554]                   20
    With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;[3555]
    Who have--as who have not, that their great stars[3556][3557]
    Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,[3556][3558]
    Which are to France the spies and speculations[3556][3559]
    Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,[3556][3560]        25
    Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,[3556]
    Or the hard rein which both of them have borne[3556][3561]
    Against the old kind king, or something deeper,[3556]
    Whereof perchance these are but furnishings,--[3556][3562]
    But true it is, from France there comes a power[3563][3564]       30
    Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,[3564][3565][3566]
    Wise in our negligence, have secret feet[3564][3565][3567]
    In some of our best ports, and are at point[3564][3565]
    To show their open banner. Now to you:[3564][3565]
    If on my credit you dare build so far[3564][3565]                 35
    To make your speed to Dover, you shall find[3564]
    Some that will thank you, making just report[3564]
    Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow[3564][3568]
    The king hath cause to plain.[3564][3569]
    I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,[3564][3569]               40
    And from some knowledge and assurance offer[3564][3569][3570]
    This office to you.[3564][3569][3570]

    _Gent._ I will talk further with you.[3571]

    _Kent._                               No, do not.
    For confirmation that I am much more[3572]
    Than my out-wall, open this purse and take                        45
    What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
    As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring,[3573]
    And she will tell you who your fellow is[3574]
    That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
    I will go seek the king.

    _Gent._                  Give me your hand:[3575]                 50
    Have you no more to say?[3575]

    _Kent._ Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
    That when we have found the king,--in which your pain[3576]
    That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him[3576]
    Holla the other.                [_Exeunt severally._[3576][3577]  55


SCENE II. _Another part of the heath. Storm still._[3578]

                        _Enter_ LEAR _and_ Fool.

    _Lear._ Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow![3579]
    You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout[3580][3581]
    Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks![3580][3582]
    You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,[3580][3583]
    Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,[3580][3584]           5
    Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,[3580][3585]
    Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world![3580][3586]
    Crack nature's moulds, all germins spill at once[3580][3587]
    That make ingrateful man![3580][3588]

    _Fool._ O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry house is[3589]        10
    better than this rain-water out o' door. Good nuncle, in,[3589][3590]
    and ask thy daughters' blessing: here's a night pities[3589][3591]
    neither wise man nor fool.[3589][3592]

    _Lear._ Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain![3593]
    Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:                  15
    I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;[3594]
    I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,[3595]
    You owe me no subscription: then let fall[3596][3597]
    Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,[3596][3598]
    A poor, infirm, weak and despised old man:[3596]                  20
    But yet I call you servile ministers,[3596]
    That have with two pernicious daughters join'd[3596][3599]
    Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head[3596][3600]
    So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul![3596][3601]

    _Fool._ He that has a house to put's head in has a good[3602]     25
    head-piece.

                The cod-piece that will house[3603]
                  Before the head has any,[3603]
                The head and he shall louse;[3603]
                  So beggars marry many.[3603]                        30
                The man that makes his toe[3603][3604]
                  What he his heart should make[3603][3605]
                Shall of a corn cry woe,[3603][3606]
                  And turn his sleep to wake.[3603]

    For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths[3607]      35
    in a glass.

    _Lear._ No, I will be the pattern of all patience;[3608]
    I will say nothing.

                             _Enter_ KENT.

    _Kent._ Who's there?

    _Fool._ Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a             40
    wise man and a fool.

    _Kent._ Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night[3609][3610]
    Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies[3609]
    Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,[3609][3611]
    And make them keep their caves: since I was man,[3609][3612]      45
    Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,[3609]
    Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never[3609][3613]
    Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry[3609]
    The affliction nor the fear.[3609]

    _Lear._                      Let the great gods,[3609][3614]
    That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,[3609][3615]        50
    Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,[3609]
    That hast within thee undivulged crimes,[3609]
    Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;[3609]
    Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue[3609][3616]
    That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,[3609][3617]        55
    That under covert and convenient seeming[3609][3618]
    Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,[3609][3619]
    Rive your concealing continents and cry[3609][3620]
    These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man[3609]
    More sinn'd against than sinning.[3621]

    _Kent._                           Alack, bare-headed![3622]       60
    Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;[3622]
    Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:[3622]
    Repose you there; while I to this hard house--[3622][3623]
    More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;[3622][3624]
    Which even but now, demanding after you,[3622][3625]              65
    Denied me to come in--return, and force[3622]
    Their scanted courtesy.[3622]

    _Lear._                 My wits begin to turn.[3626]
    Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
    I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?[3627]
    The art of our necessities is strange,[3628]                      70
    That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.[3628][3629][3630]
    Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart[3628][3630][3631]
    That's sorry yet for thee.[3632]

    _Fool._ [_Singing_] He that has and a little tiny wit,--[3633][3634][3635]
                  With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--[3634][3636]  75
                Must make content with his fortunes fit,[3634]
                  For the rain it raineth every day.[3634][3637]

    _Lear._ True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this
              hovel.                      [_Exeunt Lear and Kent._[3638]

    _Fool_. This is a brave night to cool a courtezan. I'll[3639][3640][3641]
    speak a prophecy ere I go:[3639][3640][3642]                      80
            When priests are more in word than matter;[3639][3643]
            When brewers mar their malt with water;[3639]
            When nobles are their tailors' tutors;[3639]
            No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;[3639]
            When every case in law is right;[3639]                    85
            No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;[3639][3644]
            When slanders do not live in tongues,[3639][3645]
            Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;[3639][3646]
            When usurers tell their gold i' the field,[3639]
            And bawds and whores do churches build;[3639]             90
            Then shall the realm of Albion[3639][3647]
            Come to great confusion:[3639][3647]
            Then comes the time, who lives to see't,[3639][3648]
            That going shall be used with feet.[3639][3648]
    This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.      95

                                                         [_Exit._[3649]


SCENE III. _Gloucester's castle._

                 _Enter_ GLOUCESTER _and_ EDMUND.[3650]

    _Glou._ Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural[3651]
    dealing. When I desired their leave that I might pity him,[3651]
    they took from me the use of mine own house; charged[3651][3652]
    me, on pain of their perpetual displeasure, neither to speak[3651][3653]
    of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him.[3651][3654]      5

    _Edm._ Most savage and unnatural![3651][3655]

    _Glou._ Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt[3651][3656]
    the dukes, and a worse matter than that: I have received[3651]
    a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be spoken; I[3651]
    have locked the letter in my closet: these injuries the king[3651]  10
    now bears will be revenged home; there is part of a power[3651][3657]
    already footed: we must incline to the king. I will seek[3651][3658]
    him and privily relieve him: go you, and maintain talk[3651]
    with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived: if[3651]
    he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. Though I die[3651][3659]  15
    for it, as no less is threatened me, the king my old master[3651][3660]
    must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward,[3651][3661]
    Edmund; pray you, be careful.                         [_Exit._[3651]

    _Edm._ This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke[3662][3663]
    Instantly know, and of that letter too:[3662]                     20
    This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me[3662][3664]
    That which my father loses; no less than all:[3662][3665]
    The younger rises when the old doth fall.       [_Exit._[3662][3666]


SCENE IV. _The heath. Before a hovel._[3667]

                    _Enter_ LEAR, KENT, _and_ FOOL.

    _Kent_. Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:[3668]
    The tyranny of the open night's too rough[3668][3669]
    For nature to endure.                    [_Storm still._[3668][3670]

    _Lear._               Let me alone.[3671]

    _Kent._ Good my lord, enter here.[3671]

    _Lear._                           Wilt break my heart?[3672]

    _Kent._ I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.[3673]    5

    _Lear._ Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm[3674]
    Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;[3675]
    But where the greater malady is fix'd
    The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear,[3676]
    But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea[3677]                 10
    Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the mind's free[3678]
    The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind[3679]
    Doth from my senses take all feeling else
    Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude![3680]
    Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand[3681]               15
    For lifting food to't? But I will punish home.[3682]
    No, I will weep no more. In such a night[3683]
    To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.[3683]
    In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
    Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave you all,--[3684]     20
    O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
    No more of that.

    _Kent._          Good my lord, enter here.[3685]

    _Lear._ Prithee, go in thyself; seek thine own ease:[3686]
    This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
    On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.                     25
    [_To the Fool_] In, boy; go first. You houseless
        poverty,--[3687][3688][3689]
    Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.

                                           [_Fool goes in._[3688][3690]

    Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
    That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,[3691]
    How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,                   30
    Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you[3692]
    From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
    Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
    Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
    That thou mayst shake the superflux to them                       35
    And show the heavens more just.[3693]

    _Edg._ [_Within_] Fathom and half, fathom and half![3694][3695]
    Poor Tom!           [_The Fool runs out from the hovel._[3695][3696]

    _Fool._ Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help[3697]
    me, help me![3697]                                                40

    _Kent._ Give me thy hand. Who's there?[3698]

    _Fool._ A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.[3699]

    _Kent._ What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?[3700][3701]
    Come forth.[3700]

              _Enter_ EDGAR _disguised as a madman_.[3702]

    _Edg._ Away! the foul fiend follows me! 'Through
        the[3703][3704][3705][3706]                                   45
    sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.' Hum! go to thy[3704][3706][3707]
    cold bed and warm thee.[3704][3708]

    _Lear._ Hast thou given all to thy two daughters? and[3709][3710]
    art thou come to this?[3709]

    _Edg._ Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the                  50
    foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through[3711]
    ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire; that hath laid[3712]
    knives under his pillow and halters in his pew; set ratsbane[3713]
    by his porridge; made him proud of heart, to ride on[3714]
    a bay trotting-horse over four-inched bridges, to course his[3715]  55
    own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's[3716]
    a-cold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,[3716][3717]
    star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some[3718]
    charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him
    now, and there, and there again, and there. [_Storm still._[3719]  60

    _Lear._ What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?[3720]
    Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?[3721]

    _Fool._ Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all
    shamed.[3722]

    _Lear._ Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air            65
    Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters![3723]

    _Kent._ He hath no daughters, sir.

    _Lear._ Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
    To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
    Is it the fashion that discarded fathers                          70
    Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
    Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot[3724]
    Those pelican daughters.[3724][3725]

    _Edg._ Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:[3726][3727]
    Halloo, halloo, loo, loo![3726][3728]                             75

    _Fool._ This cold night will turn us all to fools and
    madmen.

    _Edg._ Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;[3729]
    keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with man's[3730]
    sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud array.[3731]       80
    Tom's a-cold.

    _Lear._ What hast thou been?

    _Edg._ A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that
    curled my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of[3732]
    my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with her;[3733]    85
    swore as many oaths as I spake words and broke them in
    the sweet face of heaven: one that slept in the contriving of[3734]
    lust and waked to do it: wine loved I deeply, dice dearly,[3735]
    and in woman out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart,
    light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,[3736]  90
    wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not
    the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy[3737]
    poor heart to woman: keep thy foot out of brothels, thy[3738]
    hand out of plackets, thy pen from lenders' books, and defy[3739]
    the foul fiend.                                                   95

        'Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind.'[3740]
        Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.[3741]
        Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.

                                                   [_Storm still._[3742]

    _Lear._ Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer[3743][3744]
    with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.[3744]       100
    Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou owest[3744][3745]
    the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the[3744]
    cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on's are sophisticated.[3744][3746]
    Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more[3744]
    but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off,[3744]  105
    you lendings! come, unbutton here.[3744]

                                       [_Tearing off his clothes._[3747]

    _Fool._ Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night[3748]
    to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an[3749]
    old lecher's heart, a small spark, all the rest on's body cold.[3750]
    Look, here comes a walking fire.                                 110

               _Enter_ GLOUCESTER, _with a torch_.[3751]

    _Edg._ This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins at[3752]
    curfew and walks till the first cock; he gives the web and[3753][3754]
    the pin, squints the eye and makes the hare-lip; mildews[3754][3755]
    the white wheat and hurts the poor creature of earth.[3756]

            Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old;[3757][3758]        115
            He met the night-mare and her nine-fold;[3757][3759]
                  Bid her alight,[3757][3760]
                  And her troth plight,[3757][3761]
            And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee![3757][3762]

    _Kent._ How fares your grace?                                    120

    _Lear._ What's he?[3763]

    _Kent._ Who's there? What is't you seek?[3764]

    _Glou._ What are you there? Your names?

    _Edg._ Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
    the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury[3765]  125
    of his heart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for
    sallets; swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog; drinks the[3766]
    green mantle of the standing pool; who is whipped from
    tithing to tithing, and stock-punished, and imprisoned;[3767]
    who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his body,[3768]  130
    horse to ride and weapon to wear;[3769]

            But mice and rats and such small deer[3770]
            Have been Tom's food for seven long year.[3771]

    Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend![3772]

    _Glou._ What, hath your grace no better company?                 135

    _Edg._ The prince of darkness is a gentleman: Modo[3773][3774]
    he's call'd, and Mahu.[3773][3775]

    _Glou._ Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,[3776][3777]
    That it doth hate what gets it.[3776][3778]

    _Edg._ Poor Tom's a-cold.[3779][3780]                            140

    _Glou._ Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer[3781]
    To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:[3781]
    Though their injunction be to bar my doors[3781][3782]
    And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,[3781]
    Yet have I ventured to come seek you out[3781][3783]             145
    And bring you where both fire and food is ready.[3781][3784]

    _Lear._ First let me talk with this philosopher.
    What is the cause of thunder?

    _Kent._ Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.[3785]

    _Lear._ I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.[3786][3787]  150
    What is your study?[3786]

    _Edg._ How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.

    _Lear._ Let me ask you one word in private.[3788]

    _Kent._ Importune him once more to go, my lord;[3789][3790]
    His wits begin to unsettle.[3789]

    _Glou._            Canst thou blame him?  [_Storm still._[3791]  155
    His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent![3792]
    He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
    Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,[3793]
    I am almost mad myself: I had a son,[3794]
    Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,[3795]             160
    But lately, very late: I loved him, friend,
    No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,[3796]
    The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this![3797]
    I do beseech your grace,--[3798]

    _Lear._                    O, cry you mercy, sir.[3799]
    Noble philosopher, your company.[3799]                           165

    _Edg._ Tom's a-cold.[3780]

    _Glou._ In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.[3800]

    _Lear._ Come, let's in all.

    _Kent._                     This way, my lord.

    _Lear._                                        With him;[3801]
    I will keep still with my philosopher.[3801]

    _Kent._ Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.[3802]  170

    _Glou._ Take him you on.

    _Kent._ Sirrah, come on; go along with us.[3803]

    _Lear._ Come, good Athenian.[3804]

    _Glou._ No words, no words: hush.[3804]

    _Edg._   Child Rowland to the dark tower came:[3805]             175
        His word was still 'Fie, foh, and fum,
          I smell the blood of a British man.'          [_Exeunt._[3806]


SCENE V. _Gloucester's castle._

                  _Enter_ CORNWALL _and_ EDMUND.[3807]

    _Corn._ I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.[3808]

    _Edm._ How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature
    thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.

    _Corn._ I now perceive, it was not altogether your brother's
    evil disposition made him seek his death, but a provoking[3809]    5
    merit, set a-work by a reproveable badness in himself.[3809][3810]

    _Edm._ How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent
    to be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which approves[3811]
    him an intelligent party to the advantages of France. O[3812]
    heavens! that this treason were not, or not I the detector![3813]  10

    _Corn._ Go with me to the duchess.

    _Edm._ If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
    mighty business in hand.

    _Corn._ True or false, it hath made thee earl of Gloucester.
    Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our        15
    apprehension.

    _Edm._ [_Aside_] If I find him comforting the king, it will[3814]
    stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persever in my course[3815]
    of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my
    blood.                                                            20

    _Corn._ I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a
    dearer father in my love.                           [_Exeunt._[3816]


SCENE VI. _A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle._

        _Enter_ GLOUCESTER, LEAR, KENT, Fool, _and_ EDGAR.[3817]

    _Glou._ Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully.
    I will piece out the comfort with what addition I
    can: I will not be long from you.

    _Kent._ All the power of his wits have given way to his[3818]
    impatience: the gods reward your kindness!                         5

                                               [_Exit Gloucester._[3819]

    _Edg._ Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an[3820]
    angler in the lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware[3821]
    the foul fiend.

    _Fool._ Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a[3822]
    gentleman or a yeoman.[3823]                                      10

    _Lear._ A king, a king!

    _Fool._ No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his[3824]
    son, for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman[3824][3825]
    before him.[3824]

    _Lear._ To have a thousand with red burning spits[3824][3826]     15
    Come hissing in upon 'em,--[3826][3827]

    _Edg._ The foul fiend bites my back.[3828]

    _Fool._ He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf,[3828][3829]
    a horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.[3828][3830]

    _Lear._ It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.[3828][3831]  20
    [_To Edgar_] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;[3828][3832]
    [_To the Fool_] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes![3828][3833]

    _Edg._ Look, where he stands and glares!
        Wantest[3828][3834][3835][3836][3837]
    thou eyes at trial, madam?[3828][3834][3835][3837][3838]
          Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.[3828][3834][3835][3839]  25

    _Fool._    Her boat hath a leak,[3828][3834][3840][3841]
            And she must not speak[3828][3834][3841]
          Why she dares not come over to thee.[3828][3834]

    _Edg._ The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of[3828]
    a nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two white[3828]  30
    herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no food for thee.[3828][3842]

    _Kent._ How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:[3828][3843]
    Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?[3828][3843][3844]

    _Lear._ I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.[3828][3845][3846]
    [_To Edgar_] Thou robed man of justice take thy place;[3828][3845][3847]  35
    [_To the Fool_] And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,[3828][3845][3848]
    Bench by his side. [_To Kent_] You are o' the commission;[3828][3845][3849]
    Sit you too.[3828][3845]

    _Edg._ Let us deal justly.[3828][3845][3850]
        Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly
              shepherd?[3828][3845][3850][3851][3852]                 40
          Thy sheep be in the corn;[3828][3845][3850][3852]
        And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,[3828][3845][3850][3852]
          Thy sheep shall take no harm.[3828][3845][3850][3852]
    Pur! the cat is gray.[3828][3845][3850]

    _Lear._ Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take
        my[3828][3845][3850][3853]                                    45
    oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
        poor[3828][3845][3853][3854]
    king her father.[3828][3845][3853]

    _Fool._ Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?[3828]

    _Lear._ She cannot deny it.[3828][3855]

    _Fool._ Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.[3828][3856]  50

    _Lear._ And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim[3828][3857]
    What store her heart is made on. Stop her there![3828][3857][3858]
    Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place![3828][3859]
    False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?[3828]

    _Edg._ Bless thy five wits!                                       55

    _Kent._ O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
    That you so oft have boasted to retain?[3860]

    _Edg._ [_Aside_] My tears begin to take his part so much,[3861]
    They'll mar my counterfeiting.[3862]

    _Lear._ The little dogs and all,                                  60
    Tray, Blanch, and Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.

    _Edg._ Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you[3863]
    curs![3863]

              Be thy mouth or black or white,[3863]
              Tooth that poisons if it bite;[3863]                    65
              Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,[3863][3864]
              Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,[3863][3864][3865]
              Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,[3863][3866]
              Tom will make them weep and wail:[3863][3867]
              For, with throwing thus my head,[3863]                  70
              Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.[3863][3868]

    Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs[3869][3870]
    and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.[3869][3871]

    _Lear._ Then let them anatomize Regan; see what[3872][3873]
    breeds about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that[3872][3874]  75
    makes these hard hearts? [_To Edgar_] You, sir, I entertain[3872][3875]
    for one of my hundred; only I do not like the fashion[3872][3876]
    of your garments. You will say they are Persian attire;[3872][3877]
    but let them be changed.[3872]

    _Kent._ Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.[3878]        80

    _Lear._ Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:[3879]
    so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' the morning. So,[3879][3880]
    so, so.

    _Fool._ And I'll go to bed at noon.

                      _Re-enter_ GLOUCESTER.[3881]

    _Glou._ Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?[3882]   85

    _Kent._ Here, sir; but trouble him not: his wits are gone.

    _Glou._ Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
    I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
    There is a litter ready; lay him in't,[3883][3884]
    And drive toward Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet[3883][3885]  90
    Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:[3883]
    If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,[3883][3886]
    With thine and all that offer to defend him,[3883]
    Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up,[3883][3887]
    And follow me, that will to some provision[3883]                  95
    Give thee quick conduct.

    _Kent._                  Oppressed nature sleeps.[3888][3889]
    This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken sinews,[3888][3890]
    Which, if convenience will not allow,[3888][3891][3892]
    Stand in hard cure.  [_To the Fool_]  Come, help to bear thy
        master;[3888][3891][3893]
    Thou must not stay behind.[3888][3891]

    _Glou._                    Come, come, away.                     100

    _Edg._ When we our betters see bearing our woes,[3895][3896]
    We scarcely think our miseries our foes.[3895][3896]
    Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,[3895][3897]
    Leaving free things and happy shows behind:[3895]
    But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip,[3895][3898]     105
    When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.[3895]
    How light and portable my pain seems now,[3895]
    When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,[3895]
    He childed as I father'd! Tom, away![3895][3899]

SCENE VII. _Gloucester's castle._

    _Enter_ CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, _and_ Servants.[3904]

    _Corn._ Post speedily to my lord your husband; show[3905]
    him this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek out the[3905]
    traitor Gloucester.      [_Exeunt some of the Servants._[3905][3906]

    _Reg._ Hang him instantly.

    _Gon._ Pluck out his eyes.                                         5

    _Corn._ Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep[3907][3908]
    you our sister company: the revenges we are bound to take[3907][3909]
    upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding.[3907]
    Advise the duke, where you are going, to a most festinate[3907][3910]
    preparation: we are bound to the like. Our posts shall
        be[3907][3911][3912]                                          10
    swift and intelligent betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister:[3911][3913]
    farewell, my lord of Gloucester.[3911]

                         _Enter_ OSWALD.[3914]

    How now! where's the king?

    _Osw._ My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
    Some five or six and thirty of his knights,[3915]                 15
    Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;[3915][3916]
    Who, with some other of the lords dependants,[3915][3917]
    Are gone with him toward Dover; where they boast[3915][3918]
    To have well-armed friends.[3915]

    _Corn._                     Get horses for your mistress.

    _Gon._ Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.                          20

    _Corn._ Edmund, farewell.

                           [_Exeunt Goneril, Edmund, and Oswald._[3919]

                              Go seek the traitor Gloucester.
    Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.

                                        [_Exeunt other Servants._[3920]

    Though well we may not pass upon his life[3921]
    Without the form of justice, yet our power
    Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men[3922][3923]           25
    May blame but not control. Who's there? the traitor?[3922]

        _Enter_ GLOUCESTER, _brought in by two or three_.[3924]

    _Reg._ Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.

    _Corn._ Bind fast his corky arms.

    _Glou._ What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider[3925][3926]
    You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.[3925]             30

    _Corn._ Bind him, I say.                 [_Servants bind him._[3927]

    _Reg._                Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!

    _Glou._ Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.[3928]

    _Corn._ To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--

                                       [_Regan plucks his beard._[3929]

    _Glou._ By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done[3930]
    To pluck me by the beard.[3930]                                   35

    _Reg._ So white, and such a traitor!

    _Glou._                              Naughty lady,[3931]
    These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin[3931]
    Will quicken and accuse thee: I am your host:[3932]
    With robbers' hands my hospitable favours[3933]
    You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?[3934]               40

    _Corn._ Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?[3935]

    _Reg._ Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.[3936]

    _Corn._ And what confederacy have you with the traitors[3937]
    Late footed in the kingdom?[3937][3938]

    _Reg._ To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king?[3939][3940]  45
    Speak.[3939]

    _Glou._ I have a letter guessingly set down,[3941]
    Which came from one that's of a neutral heart
    And not from one opposed.

    _Corn._                   Cunning.

    _Reg._                             And false.

    _Corn._ Where hast thou sent the king?

    _Glou._                                To Dover.[3942]            50

    _Reg._ Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--[3943]

    _Corn._ Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.[3944]

    _Glou._ I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.[3945]

    _Reg._ Wherefore to Dover, sir?[3946]

    _Glou._ Because I would not see thy cruel nails                   55
    Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister
    In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.[3947]
    The sea, with such a storm as his bare head[3948]
    In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,[3949]
    And quench'd the stelled fires:[3950][3951]                       60
    Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.[3950][3952]
    If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,[3953]
    Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key,'[3954]
    All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see[3955]
    The winged vengeance overtake such children.                      65

    _Corn._ See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
    Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.[3956]

    _Glou._ He that will think to live till he be old,[3957]
    Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods![3958]

    _Reg._ One side will mock another; the other too.[3959]           70

    _Corn._ If you see vengeance--[3960]

    _First Serv._                  Hold your hand, my lord:
    I have served you ever since I was a child;[3961]
    But better service have I never done you[3962]
    Than now to bid you hold.[3962]

    _Reg._                    How now, you dog!

    _First Serv._ If you did wear a beard upon your chin,[3963]       75
    I'ld shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?[3963][3964]

    _Corn._ My villain!                    [_They draw and fight._[3965]

    _First Serv._ Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.[3966]

    _Reg._ Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!

                         [_Takes a sword and runs at him behind._[3967]

    _First Serv._ O, I am slain! My lord, you have one
              eye left[3968][3969]                                    80
    To see some mischief on him. O!                 [_Dies._[3968][3970]

    _Corn._ Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly![3971]
    Where is thy lustre now?[3972]

    _Glou._ All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?[3973]
    Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,[3974][3975]            85
    To quit this horrid act.[3974]

    _Reg._                   Out, treacherous villain![3976][3977]
    Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he[3976]
    That made the overture of thy treasons to us;[3976][3978]
    Who is too good to pity thee.[3976]

    _Glou._ O my follies! Then Edgar was abused.[3979][3980]          90
    Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him![3979]

    _Reg._ Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell[3979][3981][3982]
    His way to Dover. [_Exit one with Gloucester._] How is't,
        my lord? how look you?[3979][3981][3983]

    _Corn._ I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
    Turn out that eyeless villain: throw this slave[3984]             95
    Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:[3984][3985]
    Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.

                            [_Exit Cornwall, led by Regan._[3984][3986]

    _Sec. Serv._ I'll never care what wickedness I do,[3987][3988]
    If this man come to good.[3987]

    _Third Serv._             If she live long,[3987][3989][3990]
    And in the end meet the old course of death,[3987][3990]         100
    Women will all turn monsters.[3987][3990]

    _Sec. Serv._ Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam[3987][3991]
    To lead him where he would: his roguish madness[3987][3992]
    Allows itself to any thing.[3987]

    _Third Serv._ Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites
        of eggs[3987][3993][3994]                                    105
    To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!

ACT IV.


SCENE I. _The heath._[3996]

                             _Enter_ EDGAR.

    _Edg._ Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,[3997]
    Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,[3998]
    The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,[3999]
    Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:[4000]
    The lamentable change is from the best;                            5
    The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,[4001][4002]
    Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace![4002]
    The wretch that them hast blown unto the worst[4002]
    Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?[4002][4003][4004]

             _Enter_ GLOUCESTER, _led by an_ Old Man.[4005]

    My father, poorly led? World, world, O world![4005][4006]         10
    But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,[4007]
    Life would not yield to age.[4008]

    _Old Man._ O, my good lord, I have been your tenant,[4009]
    and your father's tenant, these fourscore years.[4009][4010]

    _Glou._ Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:                15
    Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
    Thee they may hurt.

    _Old Man._ Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.[4011]

    _Glou._ I have no way and therefore want no eyes;
    I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,                        20
    Our means secure us, and our mere defects[4012]
    Prove our commodities. Ah, dear son Edgar,[4013]
    The food of thy abused father's wrath!
    Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
    I'ld say I had eyes again!

    _Old Man._                 How now! Who 's there?[4014]           25

    _Edg. [Aside]_ O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the
           worst'?[4015][4016]
    I am worse than e'er I was.[4017]

    _Old Man._                  'Tis poor mad Tom.

    _Edg. [Aside]_ And worse I may be yet: the worst is not[4015]
    So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'[4018]

    _Old Man._ Fellow, where goest?

    _Glou._                         Is it a beggar-man?               30

    _Old Man._ Madman and beggar too.

    _Glou._ He has some reason, else he could not beg.[4019]
    I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw,[4020]
    Which made me think a man a worm: my son
    Came then into my mind, and yet my mind                           35
    Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard more since.[4021]
    As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods;[4022]
    They kill us for their sport.[4023]

    _Edg. [Aside]_                How should this be?[4015][4024][4025]
    Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,[4024][4026]
    Angering itself and others. Bless thee, master![4024][4027]       40

    _Glou._ Is that the naked fellow?

    _Old Man._                        Ay, my lord.

    _Glou._ Then, prithee, get thee gone: if for my sake[4028]
    Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain[4029]
    I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;[4030]
    And bring some covering for this naked soul,[4031]                45
    Who I'll entreat to lead me.[4032]

    _Old Man._                   Alack, sir, he is mad.

    _Glou._ 'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.[4033]
    Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;[4034]
    Above the rest, be gone.

    _Old Man._ I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,[4035][4036]  50
    Come on't what will.                                        [_Exit._

    _Glou._ Sirrah, naked fellow,--[4037]

    _Edg._ Poor Tom's a-cold. [_Aside_] I cannot daub it
            further.[4015][4038]

    _Glou._ Come hither, fellow.

    _Edg. [Aside]_ And yet I must. Bless thy sweet eyes,
            they bleed.[4015][4039]                                   55

    _Glou._ Know'st thou the way to Dover?

    _Edg._ Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor[4040]
    Tom hath been scared out of his good wits. Bless thee,
        good[4040][4041][4042]
    man's son, from the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in
        poor[4040][4042][4043]
    Tom at once; of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of[4043][4044]  60
    dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder;[4043][4045]
    Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing; who since possesses[4043][4046]
    chambermaids and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master![4043][4047]

    _Glou._ Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues[4048]
    Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched[4049]             65
    Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still![4049]
    Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,[4050]
    That slaves your ordinance, that will not see[4051]
    Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;[4052]
    So distribution should undo excess[4053]                          70
    And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?

    _Edg._ Ay, master.

    _Glou._ There is a cliff whose high and bending head
    Looks fearfully in the confined deep:[4054]
    Bring me but to the very brim of it,                              75
    And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
    With something rich about me: from that place[4055]
    I shall no leading need.[4055][4056]

    _Edg._                   Give me thy arm:[4057]
    Poor Tom shall lead thee.                     [_Exeunt._[4057][4058]


SCENE II. _Before the Duke of Albany's palace._

                  _Enter_ GONERIL _and_ EDMUND.[4059]

    _Gon._ Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
    Not met us on the way.

                         _Enter_ OSWALD.[4060]

                           Now, where's your master?

    _Osw._ Madam, within; but never man so changed.[4061]
    I told him of the army that was landed;[4061]
    He smiled at it: I told him you were coming;[4061]                 5
    His answer was, 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery[4061]
    And of the loyal service of his son[4061]
    When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot[4061]
    And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:[4061]
    What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;[4061][4062]    10
    What like, offensive.[4061][4063]

    _Gon. [To Edm.]_ Then shall you go no further.
    It is the cowish terror of his spirit,[4064]
    That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs,
    Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way[4065]
    May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;[4065][4066]       15
    Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
    I must change arms at home and give the distaff[4067]
    Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
    Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,[4068]
    If you dare venture in your own behalf,[4069]                     20
    A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;

                                              [_Giving a favour._[4070]

    Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
    Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
    Conceive, and fare thee well.[4071]

    _Edm._ Yours in the ranks of death.

    _Gon._                              My most dear Gloucester![4072]  25

                                                   [_Exit Edmund._[4073]

    O, the difference of man and man![4072][4074][4075]
    To thee a woman's services are due:[4075][4076]
    My fool usurps my body.[4075]

    _Osw._                  Madam, here comes my lord.          [_Exit._

                         _Enter_ ALBANY.[4077]

    _Gon._ I have been worth the whistle.[4078]

    _Alb._                                O Goneril![4079]
    You are not worth the dust which the rude wind[4079][4080]        30
    Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:[4081]
    That nature which contemns its origin[4081][4082]
    Cannot be border'd certain in itself;[4081][4083]
    She that herself will sliver and disbranch[4081][4084]
    From her material sap, perforce must wither[4081][4085]           35
    And come to deadly use.[4081]

    _Gon._ No more; the text is foolish.[4081][4086]

    _Alb._ Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:[4081]
    Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?[4081][4087]
    Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?[4081]             40
    A father, and a gracious aged man,[4081]
    Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,[4081][4088]
    Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.[4081]
    Could my good brother suffer you to do it?[4081]
    A man, a prince, by him so benefited![4081][4089]                 45
    If that the heavens do not their visible spirits[4081]
    Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,[4081][4090][4091]
    It will come,[4081][4090][4092]
    Humanity must perforce prey on itself,[4081][4093][4094]
    Like monsters of the deep.[4081][4093]

    _Gon._                     Milk-liver'd man!                      50
    That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;[4095]
    Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning[4096][4097]
    Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st[4096][4098][4099]
    Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd[4098][4099][4100]
    Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?[4098]        55
    France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,[4098][4101]
    With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,[4098][4102]
    Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still and criest[4098][4103]
    'Alack, why does he so?'[4098]

    _Alb._                   See thyself, devil![4104]
    Proper deformity seems not in the fiend[4104][4105]               60
    So horrid as in woman.[4104]

    _Gon._                 O vain fool!

    _Alb._ Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,[4106][4107]
    Be-monster not thy feature. Were 't my fitness[4106][4108][4109]
    To let these hands obey my blood,[4106][4109][4110]
    They are apt enough to dislocate and tear[4106][4109][4111]       65
    Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,[4106][4112]
    A woman's shape doth shield thee.[4106]

    _Gon_. Marry, your manhood mew.[4106][4113]

                          _Enter a_ Messenger.

    _Alb._ What news?[4114]

    _Mess._ O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead,[4115][4116]  70
    Slain by his servant, going to put out[4116]
    The other eye of Gloucester.[4116]

    _Alb._                       Gloucester's eyes!

    _Mess._ A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,[4117]
    Opposed against the act, bending his sword[4118]
    To his great master; who thereat enraged[4118][4119]              75
    Flew on him and amongst them fell'd him dead,[4120]
    But not without that harmful stroke which since[4121][4122]
    Hath pluck'd him after.[4122]

    _Alb._                  This shows you are above,[4123][4124]
    You justicers, that these our nether crimes[4123][4124][4125]
    So speedily can venge. But, O poor Gloucester![4123]              80
    Lost he his other eye?[4123]

    _Mess._                Both, both, my lord.[4126]
    This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;[4126]
    'Tis from your sister.[4126]

    _Gon._ [_Aside_] One way I like this well;[4127]
    But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,[4128]
    May all the building in my fancy pluck[4129]                      85
    Upon my hateful life: another way,[4130]
    The news is not so tart. I'll read, and answer. [_Exit._[4130][4131]

    _Alb._ Where was his son when they did take his eyes?[4132]

    _Mess._ Come with my lady hither.

    _Alb._                            He is not here.[4133]

    _Mess._ No, my good lord; I met him back again.                   90

    _Alb._ Knows he the wickedness?

    _Mess._ Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him,
    And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment[4134]
    Might have the freer course.

    _Alb._                       Gloucester, I live[4135][4136]
    To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,[4135][4136][4137]  95
    And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:[4135][4136][4138]
    Tell me what more thou know'st.               [_Exeunt._[4136][4139]


SCENE III. _The French camp near Dover._[4140]

                    _Enter_ KENT _and a_ Gentleman.

    _Kent._ Why the King of France is so suddenly gone[4141]
    back know you the reason?[4141][4142]

    _Gent._ Something he left imperfect in the state which[4143]
    since his coming forth is thought of, which imports to the[4143][4144]
    kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return[4143][4145]  5
    was most required and necessary.[4143]

    _Kent._ Who hath he left behind him general?[4146]

    _Gent._ The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.[4147]

    _Kent._ Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration[4148]
    of grief?[4148]                                                   10

    _Gent._ Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence,[4149]
    And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
    Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen[4150]
    Over her passion, who most rebel-like[4150][4151]
    Sought to be king o'er her.[4150]

    _Kent._                     O, then it moved her.                 15

    _Gent._ Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove[4152]
    Who should express her goodliest. You have seen[4153]
    Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears[4154]
    Were like a better way: those happy smilets[4154][4155]
    That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know[4156]              20
    What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence
    As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,[4157][4158]
    Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,[4157]
    If all could so become it.[4157]

    _Kent._                    Made she no verbal question?[4159]

    _Gent._ Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'[4160]  25
    Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;
    Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters![4161]
    Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?[4161][4162]
    Let pity not be believed!' There she shook[4163]
    The holy water from her heavenly eyes,                            30
    And clamour moisten'd: then away she started[4164]
    To deal with grief alone.

    _Kent._                   It is the stars,[4165][4166]
    The stars above us, govern our conditions;[4166]
    Else one self mate and mate could not beget[4167]
    Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?[4168]        35

    _Gent._ No.

    _Kent._ Was this before the king return'd?

    _Gent._                                    No, since.

    _Kent._ Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;[4169]
    Who sometime in his better tune remembers[4170]
    What we are come about, and by no means[4171]                     40
    Will yield to see his daughter.[4171]

    _Gent._                         Why, good sir?

    _Kent._ A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness[4172]
    That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her[4173]
    To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
    To his dog-hearted daughters: these things sting[4174][4175]      45
    His mind so venomously that burning shame[4174][4175]
    Detains him from Cordelia.[4174][4176]

    _Gent._                    Alack, poor gentleman!

    _Kent._ Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?[4177]

    _Gent._ 'Tis so; they are afoot.[4178]

    _Kent._ Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,             50
    And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
    Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
    When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
    Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go[4179]
    Along with me.                            [_Exeunt._[4179][4180]  55


SCENE IV. _The same. A tent._

_Enter, with drum and colours,_ CORDELIA, Doctor, _and_ Soldiers.[4181]

    _Cor._ Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
    As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;[4182]
    Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,[4183]
    With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,[4184]
    Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow                           5
    In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;[4185]
    Search every acre in the high-grown field,
    And bring him to our eye.  [_Exit an Officer._]  What can
              man's wisdom[4186][4187][4188][4189]
    In the restoring his bereaved sense?[4186][4188][4190]
    He that helps him take all my outward worth.[4186][4191]          10

    _Doct._ There is means, madam:[4192]
    Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
    The which he lacks: that to provoke in him,[4193]
    Are many simples operative, whose power
    Will close the eye of anguish.

    _Cor._                         All blest secrets,[4194]           15
    All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,[4194]
    Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate[4195]
    In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;[4196]
    Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
    That wants the means to lead it.

                       _Enter a_ Messenger.[4197]

    _Mess._                          News, madam;[4198]               20
    The British powers are marching hitherward.[4198]

    _Cor._ 'Tis known before; our preparation stands
    In expectation of them. O dear father,
    It is thy business that I go about;[4199]
    Therefore great France[4199]                                      25
    My mourning and important tears hath pitied.[4200]
    No blown ambition doth our arms incite,[4201]
    But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:[4202]
    Soon may I hear and see him!                        [_Exeunt._[4203]


SCENE V. _Gloucester's castle._

                   _Enter_ REGAN _and_ OSWALD.[4204]

    _Reg._ But are my brother's powers set forth?[4205]

    _Osw._                                        Ay, madam.[4205]

    _Reg._ Himself in person there?[4205][4206]

    _Osw._                          Madam, with much ado:[4207]
    Your sister is the better soldier.[4207][4208]

    _Reg._ Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?[4209]

    _Osw._ No, madam.                                                  5

    _Reg._ What might import my sister's letter to him?[4210]

    _Osw._ I know not, lady.

    _Reg._ Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.[4211]
    It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
    To let him live: where he arrives he moves                        10
    All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,[4212]
    In pity of his misery, to dispatch[4213]
    His nighted life; moreover, to descry[4213]
    The strength o' the enemy.[4213][4214]

    _Osw._ I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.[4215]       15

    _Reg._ Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;[4216]
    The ways are dangerous.

    _Osw._                  I may not, madam:[4217]
    My lady charged my duty in this business.[4217]

    _Reg._ Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you[4218]
    Transport her purposes by word? Belike,[4218][4219]               20
    Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,[4220]
    Let me unseal the letter.

    _Osw._                    Madam, I had rather--[4221]

    _Reg._ I know your lady does not love her husband;
    I am sure of that: and at her late being here[4222]
    She gave strange œillades and most speaking looks[4223]           25
    To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.[4224]

    _Osw._ I, madam?[4225]

    _Reg._ I speak in understanding: you are; I know't:[4226]
    Therefore I do advise you, take this note:[4227]
    My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;                        30
    And more convenient is he for my hand
    Than for your lady's: you may gather more.[4228]
    If you do find him, pray you, give him this;[4229]
    And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
    I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.                        35
    So, fare you well.[4230]
    If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
    Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

    _Osw._ Would I could meet him, madam! I should show[4231]
    What party I do follow.

    _Reg._                  Fare thee well.         [_Exeunt._[4232]  40


SCENE VI. _Fields near Dover._

    _Enter_ GLOUCESTER, _and_ EDGAR _dressed like a peasant_.[4233]

    _Glou._ When shall we come to the top of that same hill?[4234]

    _Edg._ You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.[4235]

    _Glou._ Methinks the ground is even.

    _Edg._                               Horrible steep.[4236][4237]
    Hark, do you hear the sea?[4237][4238]

    _Glou._                    No, truly.

    _Edg._ Why then your other senses grow imperfect                   5
    By your eyes' anguish.

    _Glou._                So may it be indeed:
    Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st[4239]
    In better phrase and matter than thou didst.[4240]

    _Edg._ You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed[4241]
    But in my garments.

    _Glou._             Methinks you're better spoken.[4242]          10

    _Edg._ Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful[4243]
    And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low![4244]
    The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
    Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
    Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade![4245]            15
    Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
    The fishermen that walk upon the beach[4246]
    Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark[4247]
    Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy[4248]
    Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge                   20
    That on the unnumberd idle pebbles chafes[4249]
    Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,[4250]
    Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
    Topple down headlong.

    _Glou._               Set me where you stand.

    _Edg._ Give me your hand: you are now within a foot[4251][4252]   25
    Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon[4251][4253]
    Would I not leap upright.[4251][4254]

    _Glou._                   Let go my hand.
    Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
    Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods[4255]
    Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;[4256]                  30
    Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

    _Edg._ Now fare you well good sir.[4257]

    _Glou._                            With all my heart.

    _Edg._ Why I do trifle thus with his despair[4258]
    Is done to cure it.[4258]

    _Glou._ [_Kneeling_] O you mighty gods![4259]
    This world I do renounce, and in your sights                      35
    Shake patiently my great affliction off:
    If I could bear it longer and not fall
    To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
    My snuff and loathed part of nature should[4260]
    Burn itself out.  If Edgar live, O bless him![4261]               40
    Now, fellow, fare thee well.              [_He falls forward._[4262]

    _Edg._                       Gone, sir: farewell.[4263][4264]
    And yet I know not how conceit may rob[4263][4265][4266]
    The treasury of life, when life itself[4263][4265][4267]
    Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought[4263][4265]
    By this had thought been past.  Alive or dead?[4263][4265][4268]  45
    Ho, you sir!  friend!  Hear you, sir!  speak![4263][4269]
    Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.[4263][4270]
    What are you, sir?[4263]

    _Glou._            Away, and let me die.

    _Edg._ Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,[4271]
    So many fathom down precipitating,                                50
    Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;[4272]
    Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.[4273]
    Ten masts at each make not the altitude[4274]
    Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:[4275]
    Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.                            55

    _Glou._ But have I fall'n, or no?[4276]

    _Edg._ From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.[4277]
    Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far[4278]
    Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.[4279]

    _Glou._ Alack, I have no eyes.                                    60
    Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
    To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,[4280]
    When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
    And frustrate his proud will.

    _Edg._                        Give me your arm:[4281]
    Up: so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.[4282]            65

    _Glou._ Too well, too well.

    _Edg._                      This is above all strangeness.
    Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that[4283]
    Which parted from you?

    _Glou._                A poor unfortunate beggar.[4284]

    _Edg._ As I stood here below, methought his eyes[4285]
    Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,[4286]               70
    Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:[4287]
    It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
    Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours[4288]
    Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.

    _Glou._ I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear                   75
    Affliction till it do cry out itself
    'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,[4289]
    I took it for a man; often 'twould say[4290]
    'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.[4291]

    _Edg._ Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes
    here?                                                             80

     _Enter_ LEAR, _fantastically dressed with wild flowers_.[4292]

    The safer sense will ne'er accommodate[4293][4294][4295]
    His master thus.[4294]

    _Lear._ No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the[4296]
    king himself.

    _Edg._ O thou side-piercing sight![4297]                          85

    _Lear._ Nature's above art in that respect. There's your[4298]
    press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper:[4299]
    draw me a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse![4299]
    Peace, peace; this piece of toasted cheese will do 't.[4300]
    There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a giant. Bring up           90
    the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the[4301][4302]
    clout: hewgh! Give the word.[4302][4303]

    _Edg._ Sweet marjoram.

    _Lear._ Pass.

    _Glou._ I know that voice.                                        95

    _Lear._ Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered[4304]
    me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my[4305]
    beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay' and 'no'
    to every thing that I said! 'Ay' and 'no' too was no good[4306]
    divinity. When the rain came to wet me once and the wind[4307]   100
    to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at
    my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go[4308]
    to, they are not men o' their words: they told me I was[4309]
    every thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.[4310]

    _Glou._ The trick of that voice I do well remember:[4311]        105
    Is't not the king?[4311]

    _Lear._            Ay, every inch a king:[4312][4313]
    When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.[4312][4314]
    I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?[4312][4315][4316]
    Adultery?[4315][4317][4318]
    Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:[4318][4319]            110
    The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly[4318]
    Does lecher in my sight.[4318][4320]
    Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son[4318]
    Was kinder to his father than my daughters[4318][4321]
    Got 'tween the lawful sheets.[4318][4322]                        115
    To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.[4318]
    Behold yond simpering dame,[4323][4324]
    Whose face between her forks presages snow,[4323][4325]
    That minces virtue and does shake the head[4323][4326]
    To hear of pleasure's name;[4323][4327]                          120
    The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to't[4323][4328]
    With a more riotous appetite.[4323][4328][4329]
    Down from the waist they are Centaurs,[4323][4330]
    Though women all above:[4323]
    But to the girdle do the gods inherit,[4323]                     125
    Beneath is all the fiends';[4331][4332]
    There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit,[4331][4333]
    Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah,[4334]
    pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to[4335]
    sweeten my imagination: there's money for thee.[4335]            130

    _Glou._ O, let me kiss that hand!

    _Lear._ Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.[4336]

    _Glou._ O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world[4337]
    Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?[4337][4338]

    _Lear._ I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou[4339]       135
    squiny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I'll not love.[4340]
    Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning on't.[4341]

    _Glou._ Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.[4342]

    _Edg._ I would not take this from report: it is,[4343]
    And my heart breaks at it.[4343]                                 140

    _Lear._ Read.

    _Glou._ What, with the case of eyes?[4344]

    _Lear._ O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
    head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a[4345][4346]
    heavy case, your purse in a light: yet you see how this[4345][4347]  145
    world goes.[4348]

    _Glou._ I see it feelingly.

    _Lear._ What, art mad? A man may see how this world[4349]
    goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond[4350][4351]
    justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in thine ear:[4351][4352]  150
    change places, and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which[4353][4354]
    is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a[4353]
    beggar?

    _Glou._ Ay, sir.[4355]

    _Lear._ And the creature run from the cur? There thou            155
    mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed[4356]
    in office.
    Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand![4357]
    Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;[4357][4358]
    Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind[4357][4359]           160
    For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.[4357][4360]
    Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;[4361][4362]
    Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,[4361][4363][4364]
    And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;[4361][4364]
    Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.[4361][4364][4365]  165
    None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:[4361][4364][4366]
    Take that of me, my friend, who have the power[4361][4364]
    To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes,[4361][4364]
    And, like a scurvy politician, seem[4361]
    To see the things thou dost not.[4361]                           170
    Now, now, now, now: pull off my boots: harder, harder:[4367][4368]
    so.[4368]

    _Edg._ O, matter and impertinency mix'd![4369][4370]
    Reason in madness![4369]

    _Lear._ If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.[4371][4372]  175
    I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:[4371]
    Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:[4371]
    Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,[4371][4373]
    We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.[4371][4374]

    _Glou._ Alack, alack the day![4371]                              180

    _Lear._ When we are born, we cry that we are come[4371]
    To this great stage of fools. This 's a good block.[4371][4375]
    It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe[4371][4376]
    A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;[4371][4377]
    And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,[4371][4378]       185
    Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill![4371]

             _Enter a_ Gentleman, _with_ Attendants.[4379]

    _Gent._ O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,[4371][4380]
    Your most dear daughter--[4371][4381]

    _Lear._ No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even[4371][4382]
    The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;[4371]                  190
    You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;[4371][4383]
    I am cut to the brains.[4371][4384]

    _Gent._                 You shall have any thing.[4371]

    _Lear._ No seconds? all myself?[4371]
    Why, this would make a man a man of salt,[4371][4385]
    To use his eyes for garden water-pots,[4371][4386]               195
    Ay, and laying autumn's dust.[4371][4387]

    _Gent._ Good sir,--[4371][4387]

    _Lear._ I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What![4371][4387][4388]
    I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,[4371][4387]
    My masters, know you that.[4371][4387]                           200

    _Gent._ You are a royal one, and we obey you.[4371]

    _Lear._ Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you[4371][4389][4390]
    shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.[4371][4389]

                               [_Exit running; Attendants follow._[4391]

    _Gent._ A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,[4371]
    Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,[4371][4392]  205
    Who redeems nature from the general curse[4371]
    Which twain have brought her to.[4371][4393]

    _Edg._ Hail, gentle sir.

    _Gent._                  Sir, speed you: what's your will?

    _Edg._ Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?[4394]

    _Gent._ Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,[4395][4396]  210
    Which can distinguish sound.[4395][4397]

    _Edg._                       But, by your favour,[4398]
    How near's the other army?[4398][4399]

    _Gent._ Near and on speedy foot; the main descry[4400]
    Stands on the hourly thought.

    _Edg._                        I thank you, sir: that's all.[4401]

    _Gent._ Though that the queen on special cause is here,          215
    Her army is moved on.

    _Edg._                I thank you, sir.          [_Exit Gent._[4402]

    _Glou._ You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;[4403]
    Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
    To die before you please!

    _Edg._                    Well pray you, father.[4404]

    _Glou._ Now, good sir, what are you?                             220

    _Edg._ A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;[4405]
    Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,[4406]
    Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
    I'll lead you to some biding.

    _Glou._                       Hearty thanks:[4407]
    The bounty and the benison of heaven[4407][4408]                 225

                         _Enter_ OSWALD.[4409]

    _Osw._             A proclaim'd prize! Most happy![4410][4411]
    That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh[4410][4412]
    To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,[4410][4413]
    Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out[4410]
    That must destroy thee.[4410]

    _Glou._                 Now let thy friendly hand[4410][4414]    230
    Put strength enough to't.           [_Edgar interposes._[4410][4415]

    _Osw._  Let go, slave, or thou diest!

    _Edg._ Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk[4419]

    And give the letters which thou find'st about me[4427]

    _Edg._ Sit you down, father; rest you.[4433][4434][4435]         255

SCENE VII. _A tent in the French camp._ LEAR _on a bed asleep, soft
music playing_; Gentleman, _and others attending_.

              _Enter_ CORDELIA, KENT, _and_ Doctor.[4462]

    _Cor._ O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,[4463]
    To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,[4463][4464]
    And every measure fail me.[4463]

    _Kent._ To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.[4465]
    All my reports go with the modest truth,                           5
    Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.

    _Cor._                        Be better suited:[4466]
    These weeds are memories of those worser hours:[4466]
    I prithee, put them off.[4466]

    _Kent._                  Pardon me, dear madam;[4467]
    Yet to be known shortens my made intent:[4468]
    My boon I make it, that you know me not                           10
    Till time and I think meet.

    _Cor._ Then be't so, my good lord. [_To the Doctor_]
                How does the king?[4469]

    _Doct._ Madam, sleeps still.[4470][4471]

    _Cor._ O you kind gods,[4472][4473]
    Cure this great breach in his abused nature![4473]                15
    The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up[4474]
    Of this child-changed father!

    _Doct._                       So please your majesty[4470][4475][4476]
    That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.[4476][4477]

    _Cor._ Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
    I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?[4478]                20

    _Gent._ Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep[4479]
    We put fresh garments on him.

    _Doct._ Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;[4480]
    I doubt not of his temperance.[4481]

    _Cor._                         Very well.[4482]

    _Cor._ Had you not been their father, these white flakes[4487]    30
    Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face[4488]
    To be opposed against the warring winds?[4489]
    To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?[4490][4491]
    In the most terrible and nimble stroke[4490]

    With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,[4490][4493][4494][4495]

    Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.[4498]

    _Doct._ Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.[4499]

    _Cor._ How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?[4500]

    _Lear._ You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:[4501]        45
    Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
    Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
    Do scald like molten lead.

    _Cor._                     Sir, do you know me?[4502]

    _Lear._ You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?[4503]

    _Cor._ Still, still, far wide!                                    50

    _Doct._ He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.[4504]

    _Lear._ Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?[4504]
    I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,[4505]
    To see another thus. I know not what to say.[4506]
    I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;                   55
    I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured[4507]
    Of my condition![4507]

    _Cor._           O, look upon me, sir,[4508][4509]
    And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.[4508][4510]
    No, sir, you must not kneel.[4508]

    _Lear._                      Pray, do not mock me:[4511]

    Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;[4512]
    And, to deal plainly,[4513]
    I fear I am not in my perfect mind.[4514]
    Methinks I should know you and know this man;
    Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant[4515]                 65
    What place this is, and all the skill I have
    Remembers not these garments, nor I know not[4516]
    Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;[4517]

    To be my child Cordelia.

    _Cor._                   And so I am, I am.[4518]                 70

    _Lear._ Be your tears wet? yes, faith. I pray, weep not:[4519]
    If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
    I know you do not love me; for your sisters
    Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:[4520]
    You have some cause, they have not.[4521]

    _Cor._                              No cause, no cause.           75

    _Lear._ Am I in France?

    _Kent._                 In your own kingdom, sir.

    _Lear._ Do not abuse me.[4522]

    _Doct._ Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,[4523]
    You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger[4523][4524][4525][4526]
    To make him even o'er the time he has lost.[4523][4525][4527]     80
    Desire him to go in; trouble him no more[4523][4528]
    Till further settling.[4523]

    _Cor._ Will't please your highness walk?[4529]

    _Lear._ You must bear with me. Pray you now, forget[4530]
    and forgive: I am old and foolish.[4530]                          85

                             [_Exeunt all but Kent and Gentleman._[4531]

    _Gent._ Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall[4532][4533][4534]

    _Kent._ Most certain, sir.[4532][4533]

    _Gent._ Who is conductor of his people?[4532][4533]

    _Kent._ As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.[4532][4533][4535]  90

    _Gent._ They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the[4532][4533]
    Earl of Kent in Germany.[4532][4533][4536]

    _Kent._ Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about;[4532][4536][4537]

ACT V.


SCENE I. _The British camp near Dover._

    _Enter, with drum and colours_, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, _and_
                            Soldiers.[4541]

    _Edm._ Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
    Or whether since he is advised by aught
    To change the course: he's full of alteration[4542]
    And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.

                                  [_To a Gentleman, who goes out._[4543]

    _Reg._ Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.                   5

    _Edm._ 'Tis to be doubted, madam.

    _Reg._                             Now, sweet lord,
    You know the goodness I intend upon you:
    Tell me, but truly, but then speak the truth,[4544]
    Do you not love my sister?

    _Edm._                     In honour'd love.[4545]

    _Reg._ But have you never found my brother's way[4546]            10
    To the forfended place?[4546]

    _Edm._                  That thought abuses you.[4546][4547]

    _Reg._ I am doubtful that you have been conjunct[4546][4547][4548]
    And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.[4546][4547][4548]

    _Edm._ No, by mine honour, madam.[4546][4549]

    _Reg._ I never shall endure her: dear my lord,[4550]              15
    Be not familiar with her.[4550]

    _Edm._                    Fear me not.--[4551][4552]
    She and the duke her husband![4551]

        _Enter, with drum and colours_, ALBANY, GONERIL, _and_
                            Soldiers.[4553]

    _Gon._ [_Aside_] I had rather lose the battle than that sister[4554][4555]
    Should loosen him and me.[4554][4556]

    _Alb._ Our very loving sister, well be-met.[4557]                 20
    Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,[4558]
    With others whom the rigour of our state
    Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,[4559]
    I never yet was valiant: for this business,[4559][4560]
    It toucheth us, as France invades our land,[4559]                 25
    Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,[4559][4561]
    Most just and heavy causes make oppose.[4559]

    _Edm._ Sir, you speak nobly.[4559][4562]

    _Reg._                       Why is this reason'd?

    _Gon._ Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
    For these domestic and particular broils[4563]                    30
    Are not the question here.[4564]

    _Alb._                     Let's then determine[4565]
    With the ancient of war on our proceedings.[4565][4566]

    _Edm._ I shall attend you presently at your tent.[4567]

    _Reg._ Sister, you'll go with us?

    _Gon._ No.                                                        35

    _Reg._ 'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.[4568]

    _Gon._ [_Aside_] O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.

        _As they are going out, enter_ EDGAR _disguised_.[4569]

    _Edg._ If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,[4570]
    Hear me one word.

    _Alb._            I'll overtake you. Speak.

                               [_Exeunt all but Albany and Edgar._[4571]

    _Edg._ Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.              40
    If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
    For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,[4572]
    I can produce a champion that will prove
    What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
    Your business of the world hath so an end,                        45
    And machination ceases. Fortune love you![4573]

    _Alb._ Stay till I have read the letter.[4574]

    _Edg._                                   I was forbid it.[4575]
    When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,[4575]
    And I'll appear again.[4575]

    Alb. Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.              50

                                                          [_Exit Edgar._

                        _Re-enter_ EDMUND.[4576]

    _Edm._ The enemy's in view: draw up your powers.[4577]
    Here is the guess of their true strength and forces[4578]
    By diligent discovery; but your haste[4579][4580]
    Is now urged on you.[4579]

    _Alb._               We will greet the time.          [_Exit._[4581]

    _Edm._ To both these sisters have I sworn my love;[4582]          55
    Each jealous of the other, as the stung[4583][4584]
    Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?[4583]
    Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,[4583][4585]
    If both remain alive: to take the widow
    Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;                        60
    And hardly shall I carry out my side,[4586]
    Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
    His countenance for the battle; which being done,
    Let her who would be rid of him devise[4587]
    His speedy taking off. As for the mercy[4588]                     65
    Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,[4589]
    The battle done, and they within our power,
    Shall never see his pardon; for my state[4590]
    Stands on me to defend, not to debate.                      [_Exit._


SCENE II. _A field between the two camps._

_Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours_, Lear, CORDELIA, _and_
Soldiers, _over the stage; and exeunt_.

                 _Enter_ EDGAR _and_ GLOUCESTER.[4591]

    _Edg._ Here, father, take the shadow of this tree[4592]
    For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
    If ever I return to you again,[4593]
    I'll bring you comfort.[4593]

    _Glou._                 Grace go with you, sir!       [_Exit Edgar._

           _Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter_ EDGAR.[4594]

    _Edg._ Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!                      5
    King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
    Give me thy hand; come on.

    _Glou._ No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.[4595]

    _Edg._ What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure[4596]
    Their going hence, even as their coming hither:                   10
    Ripeness is all: come on.

    _Glou._                   And that's true too.      [_Exeunt._[4597]


SCENE III. _The British camp near Dover._

    _Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours,_ EDMUND; LEAR _and_
        CORDELIA, _as prisoners_; Captain, Soldiers, _&c._[4598]

    _Edm._ Some officers take them away: good guard,
    Until their greater pleasures first be known[4599]
    That are to censure them.

    _Cor._                    We are not the first[4600][4601]
    Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.[4600]
    For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;[4600][4602]              5
    Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.[4603]
    Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

    _Lear._ No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:[4604]
    We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
    When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down                   10
    And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
    And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh[4605]
    At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
    Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,[4606]
    Who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out;[4607]                15
    And take upon's the mystery of things,
    As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
    In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones[4608]
    That ebb and flow by the moon.

    _Edm._                         Take them away.

    _Lear_. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,                        20
    The gods themselves throw incense.  Have I caught thee?[4609]
    He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
    And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;[4610]
    The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,[4611][4612]
    Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve first.[4612][4613]  25
    Come.              [_Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded._[4613][4614]

    _Edm._ Come hither, captain; hark.[4615]
    Take thou this note: go follow them to prison:[4616]
    One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost[4617][4618]
    As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way[4618]              30
    To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men[4618]
    Are as the time is: to be tender-minded[4618][4619]
    Does not become a sword: thy great employment[4618][4620]
    Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,[4618][4621]
    Or thrive by other means.[4618]

    _Capt._                   I'll do 't, my lord.                    35

    _Edm._ About it; and write happy when thou hast done.[4622]
    Mark; I say, instantly, and carry it so[4623]
    As I have set it down.

    _Capt._ I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;[4624]
    If it be man's work, I'll do't.                   [_Exit._[4624]  40

   _Flourish. Enter_ ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, _another_ Captain, _and_
                            Soldiers.[4625]

    _Alb._ Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,[4626]
    And fortune led you well: you have the captives[4627]
    That were the opposites of this day's strife:[4628]
    We do require them of you, so to use them[4629]
    As we shall find their merits and our safety                      45
    May equally determine.

    _Edm._                 Sir, I thought it fit[4630]
    To send the old and miserable king[4631][4632]
    To some retention and appointed guard;[4631][4633]
    Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,[4634]
    To pluck the common bosom on his side,[4635]                      50
    And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
    Which do command them. With him I sent the queen:[4636]
    My reason all the same; and they are ready[4636][4637]
    To-morrow or at further space to appear[4637][4638]
    Where you shall hold your session. At this time[4637][4639][4640][4641]  55
    We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;[4640][4641]
    And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed[4641]
    By those that feel their sharpness.[4641][4642]
    The question of Cordelia and her father[4641]
    Requires a fitter place.[4641]

    _Alb._                   Sir, by your patience,                   60
    I hold you but a subject of this war,[4643]
    Not as a brother.[4643]

    _Reg._            That's as we list to grace him.
    Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,[4644]
    Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
    Bore the commission of my place and person;                       65
    The which immediacy may well stand up[4645]
    And call itself your brother.

    _Gon._                        Not so hot:[4646]
    In his own grace he doth exalt himself[4646]
    More than in your addition.[4646][4647]

    _Reg._                      In my rights,[4648][4649]
    By me invested, he compeers the best.[4649]                       70

    _Gon._ That were the most, if he should husband you.[4650]

    _Reg._ Jesters do oft prove prophets.

    _Gon._                                Holla, holla![4651][4652]
    That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.[4652][4653]

    _Reg._ Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
    From a full-flowing stomach. General,
    Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
    Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:[4654]
    Witness the world, that I create thee here
    My lord and master.

    _Gon._              Mean you to enjoy him?[4655]

    _Alb._ The let-alone lies not in your good will.[4656]            80

    _Edm._ Nor in thine, lord.

    _Alb._                     Half-blooded fellow, yes.

    _Reg. [To Edmund_] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.[4657]

    _Alb._ Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee[4658]
    On capital treason; and in thine attaint[4659]
    This gilded serpent  [_pointing to Gon._].  For your claim,
        fair sister,[4660]                                            85
    I bar it in the interest of my wife;[4661]
    'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,[4662]
    And I, her husband, contradict your bans.[4663]
    If you will marry, make your loves to me;[4664]
    My lady is bespoke.

    _Gon._              An interlude![4665]                           90

    _Alb._ Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:[4665][4666]
    If none appear to prove upon thy person[4667]
    Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
    There is my pledge [_throwing down a glove_]: I'll prove it
        on thy heart,[4668][4669]
    Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less                       95
    Than I have here proclaim'd thee.

    _Reg._                            Sick, O, sick!

    _Gon._ [_Aside_] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.[4670]

    _Edm._ [_Throwing down a glove_] There's my exchange:
              what in the world he is[4668][4671]
    That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
    Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,[4672]               100
    On him, on you,--who not?--I will maintain[4673]
    My truth and honour firmly.

    _Alb._ A herald, ho!

    _Edm._                    A herald, ho, a herald![4674]

    _Alb._ Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,[4675]
    All levied in my name, have in my name[4676]                     105
    Took their discharge.[4676][4677]

    _Reg._                My sickness grows upon me.

    _Alb._ She is not well; convey her to my tent.

                                                     [_Exit Regan, led._

                        _Enter a_ Herald.[4678]

    Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,--[4679][4680]
    And read out this.[4679]

    _Capt._ Sound, trumpet!              [_A trumpet sounds._[4681]  110

    _Her._ [_Reads_] 'If any man of quality or degree within[4682][4683]
    the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed[4683]
    Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him[4684]
    appear by the third sound of the trumpet: he is bold in[4685]
    his defence.'                                                    115

       _Enter_ EDGAR, _at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet
                          before him_.[4688]

    _Alb._ Ask him his purposes, why he appears
    Upon this call o' the trumpet.

    _Her._                         What are you?[4689]               120
    Your name, your quality? and why you answer[4689][4690]
    This present summons?[4689]

    _Edg._                Know, my name is lost;[4691][4692][4693]
    By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:[4692][4693]
    Yet am I noble as the adversary[4692][4694]
    I come to cope.[4692][4695]

    _Alb._          Which is that adversary?                         125

    _Edg._ What's he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?

    _Edm._ Himself: what say'st thou to him?

    _Edg._                                        Draw thy sword,
    That if my speech offend a noble heart,[4696]
    Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.[4696][4697]
    Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,[4698]               130
    My oath, and my profession: I protest,
    Maugre thy strength, youth, place and eminence,[4699]
    Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,[4700]
    Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor,
    False to thy gods, thy brother and thy father,[4701]             135
    Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince,[4702]
    And from the extremest upward of thy head
    To the descent and dust below thy foot,[4703]
    A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
    This sword, this arm and my best spirits are bent[4704][4705]    140
    To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,[4704]
    Thou liest.[4704]

    _Edm._ In wisdom I should ask thy name,[4706]
    But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike
    And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,[4707]
    What safe and nicely I might well delay[4708]                    145
    By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:[4709]
    Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;[4710]
    With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;[4711]
    Which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,[4712]
    This sword of mine shall give them instant way,                  150
    Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!

                            [_Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls._[4713]

    _Alb._ Save him, save him![4714]

    _Gon._                     This is practice, Gloucester:[4715][4716]
    By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer[4715][4717]
    An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,[4715]
    But cozen'd and beguiled.[4715]

    _Alb._                    Shut your mouth, dame,[4718][4719]     155
    Or with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir;[4718][4720]
    Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.[4718][4721]
    No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it.[4718][4722]

    _Gon._ Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:[4723]
    Who can arraign me for't?[4723][4724]

    _Alb._                    Most monstrous![4725]                  160
    Know'st thou this paper?[4725]

    _Gon._                   Ask me not what I know.      [_Exit._[4726]

    _Alb._ Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.[4727]

    _Edm._ What you have charged me with, that have I done;[4728]
    And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
    'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou[4729]                  165
    That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,[4729][4730]
    I do forgive thee.[4729]

    _Edg._             Let's exchange charity.[4731]
    I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
    If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.[4732]
    My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.                          170
    The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices[4733]
    Make instruments to plague us:[4734][4735]
    The dark and vicious place where thee he got[4734][4736]
    Cost him his eyes.[4734]

    _Edm._             Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;[4737][4738]
    The wheel is come full circle; I am here.[4737][4739]            175

    _Alb._ Methought thy very gait did prophesy[4740]
    A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
    Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I[4741]
    Did hate thee or thy father![4741]

    _Edg._                       Worthy prince, I know't.[4742]

    _Alb._ Where have you hid yourself?[4743]                        180
    How have you known the miseries of your father?[4743][4744]

    _Edg._ By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;[4745]
    And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst![4745][4746]
    The bloody proclamation to escape[4745][4746]
    That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness![4745][4747]  185
    That we the pain of death would hourly die[4745][4748]
    Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift[4745]
    Into a madman's rags, to assume a semblance[4745]
    That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit[4745][4749]
    Met I my father with his bleeding rings,[4745]                   190
    Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,[4750]
    Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
    Never--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,[4751]
    Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd;[4752]
    Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,                   195
    I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
    Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,--[4753][4754]
    Alack, too weak the conflict to support!--[4754]
    'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,[4754][4755]
    Burst smilingly.[4756]

    _Edm._           This speech of yours hath moved me,             200
    And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
    You look as you had something more to say.

    _Alb._ If there be more, more woful, hold it in;[4757]
    For I am almost ready to dissolve,
    Hearing of this.[4758]

    _Edg._  This would have seem'd a period[4759][4760][4761][4762]  205
    To such as love not sorrow; but another,[4759][4760][4762][4763][4764]
    To amplify too much, would make much more,[4759][4760][4762][4764][4765]
    And top extremity.[4759][4760]
    Whilst I was big in clamour, came there in a man,[4759][4766]
    Who, having seen me in my worst estate,[4759][4767]              210
    Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding[4759][4768]
    Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms[4759][4769]
    He fasten'd on my neck, and bellow'd out[4759][4770]
    As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;[4759][4771]
    Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him[4759][4772]           215
    That ever ear received: which in recounting[4759]
    His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life[4759][4773]
    Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,[4759][4774]
    And there I left him tranced.[4759]

    _Alb._                        But who was this?[4759]

    _Edg._ Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise[4759]       220
    Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service[4759][4775]
    Improper for a slave.[4759]

           _Enter a_ Gentleman, _with a bloody knife_.[4776]

    _Gent._ Help, help, O, help![4777][4778]

    _Edg._                       What kind of help?[4779]

    _Alb._                                          Speak, man.

    _Edg._ What means this bloody knife?[4779]

    _Gent._                              'Tis hot, it smokes;[4780][4781]
    It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead![4781][4782]       225

    _Alb._ Who dead? speak, man.[4783]

    _Gent._ Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
    By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.[4784]

    _Edm._ I was contracted to them both: all three
    Now marry in an instant.

    _Edg._                   Here comes Kent.[4785]                  230

    _Alb._ Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead.

                                                [_Exit Gentleman._[4786]

    This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble,[4787]
    Touches us not with pity.

                             _Enter_ KENT.

                                   O, is this he?[4788][4789]
    The time will not allow the compliment[4789][4790]
    Which very manners urges.[4789][4791]

    _Kent._                   I am come[4792][4793]                  235
    To bid my king and master aye good night:[4793]
    Is he not here?

    _Alb._          Great thing of us forgot![4794][4795][4796]
    Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?[4795]
    See'st thou this object, Kent?[4795]

                [_The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in._[4797]

    _Kent._ Alack, why thus?

    _Edm._                   Yet Edmund was beloved:[4798]           240
    The one the other poison'd for my sake,[4798][4799]
    And after slew herself.[4798][4800]

    _Alb._ Even so. Cover their faces.[4794]

    _Edm._ I pant for life: some good I mean to do,[4801]
    Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,[4801][4802]            245
    Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ[4801][4803]
    Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:[4801][4804]
    Nay, send in time.[4801]

    _Alb._             Run, run, O, run![4794][4805]

    _Edg._ To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send[4806][4807]
    Thy token of reprieve.[4806]                                     250

    _Edm._ Well thought on: take my sword,[4808]
    Give it the captain.[4808]

    _Alb._      Haste thee, for thy life.     [_Exit Edgar._[4794][4809]

    _Edm._ He hath commission from thy wife and me[4810]
    To hang Cordelia in the prison, and[4810]
    To lay the blame upon her own despair,[4810]                     255
    That she fordid herself.[4810][4811]

    _Alb._ The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.[4794]

                                           [_Edmund is borne off._[4812]

  _Re-enter_ LEAR, _with_ CORDELIA _dead in his arms_; EDGAR, Captain,
                        _and others following_.

    _Lear._ Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:[4813]
    Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
    That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever![4814]     260
    I know when one is dead and when one lives;
    She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
    If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,[4815][4816]
    Why, then she lives.[4815][4817]

    _Kent._              Is this the promised end?

    _Edg._ Or image of that horror?

    _Alb._                          Fall and cease.[4794][4818]      265

    _Lear._ This feather stirs; she lives. If it be so,[4819]
    It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows[4819][4820]
    That ever I have felt.[4819]

    _Kent._   [_Kneeling_] O my good master![4821]

    _Lear._ Prithee, away.

    _Edg._                 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

    _Lear._ A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all![4822][4823]  270
    I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever![4822]
    Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha![4822][4824]
    What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,[4822][4825]
    Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.[4822][4826]
    I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.[4822]                275

    _Capt._ 'Tis true, my lords, he did.[4827]

    _Lear._                              Did I not, fellow?[4828]
    I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion[4828][4829]
    I would have made them skip: I am old now,[4828][4830]
    And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?[4828]
    Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.[4828][4831]  280

    _Kent._ If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,[4832]
    One of them we behold.[4833]

    _Lear._ This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?[4834]

    _Kent._                                         The same,[4835]
    Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?[4835]

    _Lear._ He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;[4836]           285
    He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.[4837]

    _Kent._ No, my good lord; I am the very man--[4838]

    _Lear._ I'll see that straight.

    _Kent._ That from your first of difference and decay[4839]
    Have follow'd your sad steps.

    _Lear._                       You are welcome hither.[4840]      290

    _Kent._ Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark and deadly.[4841]
    Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves.[4842]
    And desperately are dead.

    _Lear._                   Ay, so I think.[4843]

    _Alb._ He knows not what he says, and vain is it[4794][4844]
    That we present us to him.

    _Edg._                     Very bootless.                        295

                        _Enter a_ Captain.[4845]

    _Capt._ Edmund is dead, my lord.[4846]

    _Alb._                           That's but a trifle here.[4847][4848]
    You lords and noble friends, know our intent.[4847]
    What comfort to this great decay may come[4847][4849]
    Shall be applied: for us, we will resign,[4847]
    During the life of this old majesty,[4847]                       300
    To him our absolute power:  [_To Edgar and Kent_]  you, to
        your rights;[4847][4850]
    With boot, and such addition as your honours[4847][4851]
    Have more than merited. All friends shall taste[4847][4852]
    The wages of their virtue, and all foes[4852]
    The cup of their deservings. O, see, see![4852][4853]            305

    _Lear._ And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life![4854][4855]
    Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,[4854][4856]
    And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,[4854][4857]
    Never, never, never, never, never![4854][4858]
    Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.[4854][4859][4860]    310
    Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,[4860][4861]
    Look there, look there!                               [_Dies._[4860]

    _Edg._                  He faints. My lord, my lord![4862]

    _Kent._ Break, heart; I prithee, break!

    _Edg._                                  Look up, my lord.[4863]

    _Kent._ Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him[4864][4865]
    That would upon the rack of this tough world[4864][4866]         315
    Stretch him out longer.[4864]

    _Edg._                  He is gone indeed.[4867]

    _Kent._ The wonder is he hath endured so long:
    He but usurp'd his life.[4868]

    _Alb._ Bear them from hence. Our present business[4869]
    Is general woe.  [_To Kent and Edgar_]  Friends of my soul,
             you twain[4870]                                         320
    Rule in this realm and the gored state sustain.[4871]

    _Kent._ I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;[4872]
    My master calls me, I must not say no.[4872][4873]

    _Alb._ The weight of this sad time we must obey,[4872][4874]
    Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.[4872]              325
    The oldest hath borne most: we that are young[4872][4875]
    Shall never see so much, nor live so long.

NOTES.


NOTE I.

ACT I. SCENE 1. The acts and scenes are marked throughout in the
Folios, but not in the Quartos.


NOTE II.

I. 1. 25, 26. There is a curious example of careless printing here in
the third Quarto, which reads:

    '_Bast._ No my Lord.

    _Glo._ My services to your Lordship.
    unrable friend.

    _Kent._ I must loue you &c.'


NOTE III.

I. 1. 36. 'and tis our _fast_ intent.' 'This,' says Warburton, 'is
an interpolation of Mr _Lewis Theobald_, for want of knowing the
meaning of the old reading in the Quarto of 1608, and first folio of
1623; where we find it--_and 'tis our_ FIRST _intent_, which is as
_Shakespear_ wrote it.' Warburton's error was corrected by Johnson.


NOTE IV.

I. 1. 80-84. The reading given in the text is that of the Folios,
except as otherwise stated in the foot note. The first Quarto, which is
followed, except in the spelling of a word or two, by the rest, has:

                        'but now our ioy,
    Although the last, not least in our deere loue,
    What can you say to win a third, more opulent
    Then your sisters.'

Pope reads:

                    'Now our joy,
    Although our last, not least; to whose young love,
    The vines of _France_, and milk of _Burgundy_,
    Strive to be int'rest: what say you to draw
    A third, more opulent than your sisters? speak.'

Capell:

                'Now, our joy,
    Although the last, not least in our dear love,
    What can you say, to win a third more opulent
    Than your two sisters?'

Malone first gave the passage exactly as it stands in our text.


NOTE V.

I. 1. 114. This and other anonymous conjectures are found in MS. in
an imperfect copy of the second Quarto of 1608, now in the British
Museum (C. 34. k. 17). Besides those which we have quoted there are
many others made by the MS. corrector which agree either with the other
Quartos or with the Folios.


NOTE VI.

I. 1. 220. Hanmer, adopting Rowe's alteration, reads the whole passage
thus:

                'Sure th' offence
    Must be of such unnatural degree,
    As monsters it; or your fore-voucht affection
    Could not fall into taint; which to believe
    Of her must be a faith reason without
    A miracle should never plant in me.'

The next lines he also alters thus:

    '_Cor._ I yet beseech your Majesty, (if so
    I want that glib and oily art, to speak
    And purpose not, since what I well intend,
    I'll do't before I speak) that you make known &c.'


NOTE VII.

I. 4. 225-228. In this passage Rowe followed the Folios. Pope
introduced some of the lines of the Quartos, making verse of them thus:

    '_Lear's_ shadow? I would learn, for by the marks
    Of sovereignty, of knowledge, and of reason,
    I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
    Your name, fair gentlewoman?'

Theobald and Hanmer followed Pope. So did Warburton, except that in
the second line he read 'Of sovereignty of knowledge, &c.' Johnson and
Capell followed the Folios. Steevens in his edition of 1773 read as
in the text, but in 1778 recurred to the reading of Pope: except that
he transferred 'Lear's shadow?' to the end of the previous line, and
for 'learn' read 'learn that.' Mr Dyce, in his first edition, arranged
lines 225-228 thus:

    '_Lear._ I would learn that; for by the marks of sovereignty,
    Knowledge, and reason,
    I should be false persuaded I had daughters.'

In his second edition he reads:

    '_Lear._ I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,
    Knowledge, and reason, I should be false-persuaded
    I had daughters.'

Mr Staunton reads 'I would ... reason' as prose, and the next line
as verse. He suggests that "possibly the meaning may be restored
by simply omitting the comma after _sovereignty_, 'by the marks of
sovereignty knowledge and reason,' _i.e._ of _supreme_ or _sovereign_
knowledge, &c." But his later conjecture is that for 'Of sovereignty,
of knowledge' we should read 'Of sovereignly knowledge.' Mr Keightley,
adopting some of the readings of the Quartos, arranges the whole
passage as follows:

    '_Lear._ Does any here know me?--Why, this is not Lear.
    Does Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
    Either his notion weakens, or his discernings
    Are lethargied.--Sleeping or waking?--Ha!
    Sure 'tis not so.--Who is it that can tell me
    Who I am?

    _Fool._      Lear's shadow,--

    _Lear._                       I would learn that; for by
    The marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
    I should be false persuaded I had daughters.'

Becket proposes:

    'Who is it that can tell me who I am?
    Lear's shadow? I would learn that; for by the marks
    Of sov'reignty, I should be false persuaded.--
    Of knowledge and of reason I had daughters.'


NOTE VIII.

I. 4. 338. In the imperfect copy of Q₂ in the British Museum 'attaskt
for' was the original reading, but the first two letters of the word
have been erased. In II. 1. 123, 'lest,' the original reading, has been
altered to 'best.'


NOTE IX.

II. 1. 76. We take this opportunity of stating that we have not thought
it worth while, either in this play or in Hamlet, to notice the few
inaccuracies which occur in Steevens's reprints.


NOTE X.

II. 2. 40. Mr Dyce first suggested that 'Part' was intended as a
stage-direction.


NOTE XI.

II. 2. 136-142. The first Quarto, followed substantially by the others,
reads here:

    'His fault is much, and the good King his Master
    Will checke him for't; your purposd low correction
    Is such, as basest and temnest wretches for pilfrings
    And most common trespasses are punisht with,
    The King must take it ill, that hee's so slightly valued
    In his Messenger, should haue him thus restrained.'

The Folios have only the following lines:

    'The King his Master, needs must take it ill
    That he so slightly valued in his Messenger,
    Should haue him thus restrained.'

In the last line the fourth Folio reads 'this' for 'thus.' Rowe
followed the Folios. Pope first introduced the lines from the Quartos,
and gave the arrangement adopted in our text. In the third and the last
lines he introduced readings which we have given in the foot notes. The
passage was first given in Capell's edition as it actually stands in
our text.


NOTE XII.

II. 2. 163. The first Quarto here reads:

    'Of my obscured course, and shall finde time
    From this enormious state, seeking to giue
    Losses their remedies, all weary &c.'

The other Quartos differ only in spelling. The first Folio, followed
substantially by the rest, has:

    'Of my obscured course. And shall finde time
    From this enormous State, seeking to giue
    Losses their remedies. All weary &c.'

Rowe reads:

    'Of my obscured course. I shall find time
    For this enormous State, and seek to give
    Losses their Remedies. All weary &c.'

Pope followed him, but restored 'From' in the second line, and this
reading was silently adopted by Theobald and Warburton, and by Hanmer
in his margin. Johnson thinks the passage very obscure if not corrupt.
Jennens prints it as follows:

[Sidenote: [_Reading parts of the letter._]

    'Of my obscured course--_and shall find time
    From this enormous state--seeking to give
    Losses their remedies_.--All weary &c.'

Steevens (1773) gives as his own conjecture what Jennens had already
published.

Singer (ed. 1) read thus:

    'Of my obscured course; and shall find time
    From this enormous state,--seeking,--to give
    Losses their remedies:--All weary &c.'

Dr Delius adopts nearly the same punctuation:

    'Of my obscured course; and shall find time
    From this enormous state,--seeking to give
    Losses their remedies--All weary &c.'

He supposes that Kent overcome with drowsiness leaves his sentences
unfinished. Mr Bailey (_On the Received Text of Shakespeare's Dramatic
Writings, &c._ II. 91) proposes to read:

                    'and shall find balm
    For this enormous state, seeking to give
    Losses their remedies &c.'


NOTE XIII.

III. 1. 53-55. The first Folio, followed substantially by the rest,
reads thus:

    'That when we have found the King, in which your pain
    That way, Ile this: He that first lights on him,
    Holla the other.'

The Quartos thus:

    'That when we have found the King,
    Ile this way, you that, he that first lights
    On him, hollow the other.'

Pope:

    'That, when we have found the King, (in which you take
    That way, I this:) he that first lights on him,
    Hollow the other.'

Hanmer follows Pope, reading however 'for which' instead of 'in which'
in the first line. Steevens, in his edition of 1773, reads with the
Quartos, adopting the following strange punctuation, and dividing the
lines thus:

    'That when we have found the King. I'll this way,
    You that: he that first lights on him,
    Halloo the other.'


NOTE XIV.

III. 2. 2. Both Capell and Jennens agree in giving 'Your' as the
reading of the Quartos in this line for 'You,' but Capell's own copies
and all others that we have seen read 'You.'


NOTE XV.

III. 4. 112, 113. In the imperfect copy of the second Quarto in the
British Museum, it is impossible to say whether the reading was _&
the pin-queues_ or _the pin-queues_, on account of an erasure by which
it is made _he pin-queues_. Jennens quotes it as _the pin-queues_, and
this is the reading of the copy in the Bodleian Library which we have
called 'Bodl. 1.'


NOTE XVI.

III. 6. 101-114. Every editor from Theobald downwards, except Hanmer,
has reprinted this speech from the Quartos. In deference to this
consensus of authority we have retained it, though, as it seems to us,
internal evidence is conclusive against the supposition that the lines
were written by Shakespeare.


NOTE XVII.

IV. 1. 12. These conjectures of Hanmer's are derived from a letter of
his to Warburton, still unpublished, which is now in the British Museum
(Egerton, 1957).


NOTE XVIII.

IV. 6. 196-200. The first Quarto has in this passage:

    '...  water-pottes, I and laying Autumnes dust.

    _Gent._                                         Good Sir.

    _Lear._ I will dye brauely like a Bridegroome. What, I will bee
    iouiall: Come, come, I am a King my masters, know you that?'

The second Quarto omits '_Gent._ Good Sir.'

The first Folio has:

    'To vse his eyes for Garden water-pots. I wil die brauely,
    Like a smugge Bridegroome. What? I will be Iouiall:
    Come, come, I am a King, Masters, know you that?'

The second and following Folios put a full stop at 'King.'

Pope combines the readings of the Folios and second Quarto thus:

    'To use his eyes for garden-water-pots,
    And laying autumn's dust. I will die bravely,
    Like a smug bridegroom. What? I will be jovial:
    Come, come, I am a King. My masters know you that?'

He is followed by Theobald, Hanmer, Warburton and Johnson.

Capell altered the last line thus:

    'Come, come;
    I am a king, my masters; Know you that?'

The arrangement adopted in our text is that which Steevens gave in his
edition of 1778. Jennens, from whom Steevens borrowed as usual without
acknowledgement, had given in 1770 the same arrangement, omitting the
word 'smug.' In his edition of 1793 Steevens reads 'Ay and _for_ laying
autumn's dust,' making 'Ay ... sir' one line.

Mr Collier prints 'I will die bravely;' in a line by itself, adopting
in the former line the arrangement of Steevens, and in what follows
that of the Folios. Keightley reads 'Ay, and laying autumn's dust ...
bravely' as one line.


NOTE XIX.

V. 1. 26. 'Not bolds the king' is usually interpreted as an elliptical
phrase for 'Not as it emboldens the king.' This is however a very harsh
construction, and the word 'bolds' occurs nowhere else in Shakespeare
with this meaning, though we have, according to the most probable
reading, 'dear'd,' for 'endear'd,' in _Antony and Cleopatra_, I. 4.
44. Possibly these words are corrupt and a line has dropped out before
them. Albany ought to say something of this kind: 'I should be ready to
resist any mere invader, but the presence in the invader's camp of the
king and other Britons, who have just cause of enmity to us, dashes my
courage.'


NOTE XX.

V. 3. 315. Capell reads 'rough' in his text, believing that he had the
authority of the first Quarto for it; but in his own copy and that of
the Duke of Devonshire, the reading is plainly 'tough,' though the 't'
is broken.

ACT I.


SCENE I. _Venice. A street._

                   _Enter_ RODERIGO _and_ IAGO.[4877]

    _Rod._ Tush, never tell me; I take it much unkindly[4878]
    That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse[4879]
    As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.[4880]

    _Iago._ 'Sblood, but you will not hear me:[4881][4882][4883]
    If ever I did dream of such a matter,[4882][4884]                  5
    Abhor me.[4882][4884][4885]

    _Rod._ Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.[4886]

    _Iago._ Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the
              city,[4887][4888][4889]
    In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,[4888]
    Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,[4888][4890]          10
    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:[4888][4891]
    But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,[4888][4892]
    Evades them, with a bombast circumstance[4888][4893]
    Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;[4888][4894]
    And, in conclusion,[4888][4895][4896]                             15
    Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,[4896][4897]
    'I have already chose my officer.'[4896][4898][4899]
    And what was he?[4896][4898]
    Forsooth, a great arithmetician,[4896]
    One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,[4900]                           20
    A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;[4900][4901]
    That never set a squadron in the field,
    Nor the division of a battle knows
    More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,[4902]
    Wherein the toged consuls can propose[4903]                       25
    As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice[4904]
    Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:[4905]
    And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
    At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds[4906]
    Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd[4907]          30
    By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,[4908]
    He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
    And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.[4909]

    _Rod._ By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

    _Iago._ Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,[4910]  35
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,[4911]
    And not by old gradation, where each second[4912]
    Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself[4913]
    Whether I in any just term am affined[4914]
    To love the Moor.

    _Rod._            I would not follow him then.                    40

    _Iago._ O, sir, content you;
    I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
    Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark[4915]
    Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,                           45
    That doting on his own obsequious bondage
    Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
    For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:[4916]
    Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are[4917]
    Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,[4917][4918]            50
    Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,[4917]
    And throwing but shows of service on their lords[4917]
    Do well thrive by them, and when they have lined their
            coats[4919][4920]
    Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul,[4919][4921]
    And such a one do I profess myself.[4922]                         55
    For, sir,[4923]
    It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
    Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
    In following him, I follow but myself;
    Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,[4924]                60
    But seeming so, for my peculiar end:[4924]
    For when my outward action doth demonstrate[4925]
    The native act and figure of my heart
    In compliment extern, 'tis not long after[4926]
    But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve                           65
    For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.[4927]

    _Rod._ What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,[4928]
    If he can carry't thus![4929]

    _Iago._                 Call up her father,[4930]
    Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,[4930]
    Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,[4931]           70
    And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,[4932]
    Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
    Yet throw such changes of vexation on't[4933]
    As it may lose some colour.

    _Rod._ Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.               75

    _Iago._ Do; with like timorous accent and dire yell[4934]
    As when, by night and negligence, the fire[4935]
    Is spied in populous cities.[4936]

    _Rod._ What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!

    _Iago._ Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves!
              thieves![4937]                                          80
    Look to your house, your daughter and your bags![4938]
    Thieves! thieves![4939]

             BRABANTIO _appears above, at a window_.[4940]

    _Bra._ What is the reason of this terrible summons?[4941]
    What is the matter there?[4941]

    _Rod._ Signior, is all your family within?                        85

    _Iago._ Are your doors lock'd?[4942]

    _Bra._                         Why, wherefore ask you this?

    _Iago._ 'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown;[4943]
    Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;[4944]
    Even now, now, very now, an old black ram[4945]
    Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise;                          90
    Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
    Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:[4946]
    Arise, I say.[4946][4947]

    _Bra._        What, have you lost your wits?

    _Rod._ Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

    _Bra._ Not I: what are you?                                       95

    _Rod._ My name is Roderigo.

    _Bra._                      The worser welcome:[4948]
    I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:[4949]
    In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
    My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,[4950]
    Being full of supper and distempering draughts,                  100
    Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come[4951]
    To start my quiet.[4952]

    _Rod._ Sir, sir, sir,--[4953]

    _Bra._                  But thou must needs be sure
    My spirit and my place have in them power[4954]
    To make this bitter to thee.

    _Rod._                       Patience, good sir.[4955]           105

    _Bra._ What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;[4956][4957]
    My house is not a grange.[4956]

    _Rod._                    Most grave Brabantio,
    In simple and pure soul I come to you.

    Iago. 'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not[4958]
    serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do           110
    you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your[4959]
    daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you'll have your
    nephews neigh to you; you'll have coursers for cousins,
    and gennets for germans.[4960]

    _Bra._  What profane wretch art thou?                            115

    _Iago._ I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter[4961]
    and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.[4962]

    _Bra._ Thou art a villain.

    _Iago._                    You are--a senator.[4963]

    _Bra._ This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.[4964]

    _Rod._ Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,[4965]   120
    If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,[4966]
    As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,[4966]
    At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,[4966][4967]
    Transported with no worse nor better guard[4966][4968]
    But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,[4966][4969]        125
    To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor,--[4966]
    If this be known to you, and your allowance,[4966][4970]
    We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;[4966][4971]
    But if you know not this, my manners tell me[4966]
    We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe[4966]                  130
    That, from the sense of all civility,[4966]
    I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:[4966]
    Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,[4966]
    I say again, hath made a gross revolt,[4966]
    Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes,[4966][4972]            135
    In an extravagant and wheeling stranger[4966][4972][4973]
    Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:[4966][4974]
    If she be in her chamber or your house,[4975]
    Let loose on me the justice of the state
    For thus deluding you.[4976]

    _Bra._                 Strike on the tinder, ho!                 140
    Give me a taper! call up all my people!
    This accident is not unlike my dream:
    Belief of it oppresses me already.
    Light, I say! light!                            [_Exit above._[4977]

    _Iago._              Farewell; for I must leave you:
    It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,[4978]              145
    To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--[4979]
    Against the Moor: for I do know, the state,
    However this may gall him with some check,[4980]
    Cannot with safety cast him; for he's embark'd[4981]
    With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,[4982]                  150
    Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,[4983]
    Another of his fathom they have none[4984]
    To lead their business: in which regard,[4985]
    Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains,[4986]
    Yet for necessity of present life,                               155
    I must show out a flag and sign of love,[4987]
    Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,[4987][4988]
    Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;[4989]
    And there will I be with him. So farewell.                  [_Exit._

      _Enter, below,_ BRABANTIO, _in his night-gown, and_ Servants
                            _with torches_.

    _Bra._ It is too true an evil: gone she is;[4990]                160
    And what's to come of my despised time[4991]
    Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,[4992]
    Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
    With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father![4993]
    How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me[4994]          165
    Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers.[4995]
    Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?[4996]

    _Rod._ Truly, I think they are.[4997]

    _Bra._ O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood![4998]
    Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds              170
    By what you see them act. Is there not charms[4999]
    By which the property of youth and maidhood[5000]
    May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
    Of some such thing?

    _Rod._              Yes, sir, I have indeed.[5001]

    _Bra._ Call up my brother. O, would you had had her![5002]       175
    Some one way, some another. Do you know
    Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

    _Rod._ I think I can discover him, if you please
    To get good guard and go along with me.

    _Bra._ Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;[5003]        180
    I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
    And raise some special officers of night.[5004]
    On, good Roderigo; I'll deserve your pains.         [_Exeunt._[5005]


SCENE II. _Another street._

     _Enter_ OTHELLO, IAGO, _and_ Attendants _with torches_.[5006]

    _Iago._ Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
    Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience[5007]
    To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity[5008]
    Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times[5009]
    I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.[5010]        5

    _Oth._ 'Tis better as it is.[5011]

    _Iago._                           Nay, but he prated
    And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms[5012]
    Against your honour,[8, 9]
    That, with the little godliness I have,[5013]
    I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,[5014]           10
    Are you fast married? Be assured of this,[5015]
    That the magnifico is much beloved,
    And hath in his effect a voice potential
    As double as the duke's: he will divorce you,[5016]
    Or put upon you what restraint and grievance[5017]                15
    The law, with all his might to enforce it on,[5018]
    Will give him cable.[5019]

    _Oth._               Let him do his spite:
    My services, which I have done the signiory,[5020]
    Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know--
    Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,[5021]              20
    I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being[5022]
    From men of royal siege, and my demerits[5023]
    May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune[5024]
    As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
    But that I love the gentle Desdemona,                             25
    I would not my unhoused free condition
    Put into circumscription and confine
    For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?[5025]

    _Iago._ Those are the raised father and his friends:[5026]
    You were best go in.

    _Oth._               Not I; I must be found:                      30
    My parts, my title and my perfect soul,[5027]
    Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?[5028]

    _Iago._ By Janus, I think no.

      _Enter_ CASSIO, _and certain_ Officers _with torches_.[5029]

    _Oth._ The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.[5030]
    The goodness of the night upon you, friends![5031]                35
    What is the news?[5032]

    _Cas._            The duke does greet you, general,
    And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,[5033]
    Even on the instant.

    _Oth._               What is the matter, think you?[5034]

    _Cas._ Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;
    It is a business of some heat: the galleys                        40
    Have sent a dozen sequent messengers[5035]
    This very night at one anothers heels;[5036]
    And many of the consuls, raised and met,[5037]
    Are at the dukes already: you have been hotly call'd for;[5038]
    When, being not at your lodging to be found,                      45
    The senate hath sent about three several quests[5039]
    To search you out.

    _Oth._             'Tis well I am found by you.
    I will but spend a word here in the house,[5040]
    And go with you.                                [_Exit._[5040][5041]

    _Cas._           Ancient, what makes he here?

    _Iago._ Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:[5042]      50
    If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

    _Cas._ I do not understand.

    _Iago._                     He's married.

    _Cas._                                    To who?

                       _Re-enter_ OTHELLO.[5043]

    _Iago._ Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?

    _Oth._                                         Have with you.[5044]

    _Cas._ Here comes another troop to seek for you.

    _Iago._ It is Brabantio: general, be advised;[5045]               55
    He comes to bad intent.

     _Enter_ BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, _and_ Officers _with torches and
                               weapons_.

    _Oth._                  Holla! stand there![5046]

    _Rod._ Signior, it is the Moor.

    _Bra._                          Down with him, thief!

                                      [_They draw on both sides._[5047]

    _Iago._ You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

    _Oth._ Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust
              them.[5048][5049]
    Good signior, you shall more command with years[5048]             60
    Than with your weapons.[5048]

    _Bra._ O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?[5050]
    Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;[5051]
    For I'll refer me to all things of sense,[5052]
    If she in chains of magic were not bound,[5053]                   65
    Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
    So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
    The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,[5054]
    Would ever have, to incur a general mock,[5055]
    Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom[5056]                    70
    Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.[5057]
    Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense[5058][5059]
    That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,[5058]
    Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals[5058][5060]
    That weaken motion: I'll have 't disputed on;[5058][5061]         75
    'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.[5058][5062]
    I therefore apprehend and do attach thee[5058]
    For an abuser of the world, a practiser[5063]
    Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.[5064]
    Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,                               80
    Subdue him at his peril.

    _Oth._                   Hold your hands,[5065]
    Both you of my inclining and the rest:
    Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it[5066]
    Without a prompter. Where will you that I go[5067]
    To answer this your charge?[5068]

    _Bra._                      To prison, till fit time[5069]        85
    Of law and course of direct session[5069]
    Call thee to answer.[5070]

    _Oth._               What if I do obey?
    How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
    Whose messengers are here about my side,
    Upon some present business of the state                           90
    To bring me to him?[5071]

    _First Off._        'Tis true, most worthy signior;
    The duke's in council, and your noble self,
    I am sure, is sent for.[5072]

    _Bra._                  How! the duke in council!
    In this time of the night! Bring him away:[5073]
    Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,                       95
    Or any of my brothers of the state,
    Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
    For if such actions may have passage free,
    Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.      [_Exeunt._[5074]


SCENE III. _A council-chamber._

_The_ Duke _and_ Senators _sitting at a table_; Officers _attending_.[5075]

    _Duke._ There is no composition in these news[5076]
    That gives them credit.

    _First Sen._            Indeed they are disproportion'd;[5077]
    My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.[5078]

    _Duke._ And mine, a hundred and forty.

    _Sec. Sen._                             And mine, two hundred:[5079]
    But though they jump not on a just account,--                      5
    As in these cases, where the aim reports,[5080]
    'Tis oft with difference,--yet do they all confirm[5081]
    A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

    _Duke._ Nay, it is possible enough to judgement:
    I do not so secure me in the error,[5082]                         10
    But the main article I do approve[5083]
    In fearful sense.

    _Sailor._ [_Within_] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho![5084]

    _First Off._ A messenger from the galleys.

                         _Enter_ Sailor.[5085]

    _Duke._                                    Now, what's the business?

    _Sail._ The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
    So was I bid report here to the state[5086]                       15
    By Signior Angelo.[5086][5087]

    _Duke._ How say you by this change?

    _First Sen._                        This cannot be,[5088]
    By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant[5088]
    To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
    The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,                             20
    And let ourselves again but understand
    That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
    So may he with more facile question bear it,[5089]
    For that it stands not in such warlike brace,[5090]
    But altogether lacks the abilities[5090][5091]                    25
    That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,[5090][5092]
    We must not think the Turk is so unskilful[5090]
    To leave that latest which concerns him first,[5090]
    Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,[5090][5093]
    To wake and wage a danger profitless.[5090][5093]                 30

    _Duke._ Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.[5094]

    _First Off._ Here is more news.

                       _Enter a_ Messenger.[5095]

    _Mess._ The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
    Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,
    Have there injointed them with an after fleet.[5096]              35

    _First Sen._ Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?[5097]

    _Mess._ Of thirty sail: and now they do re-stem[5098]
    Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
    Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,[5099]
    Your trusty and most valiant servitor,                            40
    With his free duty recommends you thus,[5100]
    And prays you to believe him.[5101]

    _Duke._ 'Tis certain then for Cyprus.
    Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?[5102]

    _First Sen._ He's now in Florence.                                45

    _Duke._ Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.[5103]

    _First Sen._ Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.

  _Enter_ BRABANTIO, _Othello_, IAGO, RODERIGO, _and_ Officers.[5104]

    _Duke._ Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you[5105]
    Against the general enemy Ottoman.
    [_To Brabantio_] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;[5106]  50
    We lack'd your counsel and your help to-night.[5107]

    _Bra._ So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
    Neither my place nor aught I heard of business[5108]
    Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care[5109]
    Take hold on me; for my particular grief[5110]                    55
    Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
    That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,[5111]
    And it is still itself.[5112]

    _Duke._                 Why, what's the matter?

    _Bra._ My daughter! O, my daughter!

    _All._                              Dead?

    _Bra._                                    Ay, to me;[5113]
    She is abused, stol'n from me and corrupted                       60
    By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
    For nature so preposterously to err,[5114]
    Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,[5115]
    Sans witchcraft could not.[5116]

    _Duke._ Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding                65
    Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
    And you of her, the bloody book of law
    You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
    After your own sense, yea, though our proper son[5117]
    Stood in your action.

    _Bra._                Humbly I thank your grace.                  70
    Here is the man, this Moor; whom now, it seems,
    Your special mandate for the state-affairs
    Hath hither brought.

    _All._               We are very sorry for't.[5118]

    _Duke._ [_To Othello_] What in your own part can you say to this?[5119]

    _Bra._ Nothing, but this is so.                                   75

    _Oth._ Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
    My very noble and approved good masters,
    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
    It is most true; true, I have married her:
    The very head and front of my offending                           80
    Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,[5120]
    And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;[5121]
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used[5122]
    Their dearest action in the tented field;                         85
    And little of this great world can I speak,
    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;[5123]
    And therefore little shall I grace my cause
    In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,[5124]
    I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver[5125]                     90
    Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,[5126]
    What conjuration and what mighty magic--
    For such proceeding I am charged withal--[5127]
    I won his daughter.[5128]

    _Bra._              A maiden never bold;[5129]
    Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion[5129]                95
    Blush'd at herself; and she--in spite of nature,[5130]
    Of years, of country, credit, every thing--
    To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on![5131]
    It is a judgement maim'd and most imperfect[5132]
    That will confess perfection so could err[5133]                  100
    Against all rules of nature; and must be driven
    To find out practices of cunning hell,
    Why this should be. I therefore vouch again,
    That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
    Or with some dram conjured to this effect,                       105
    He wrought upon her.

    _Duke._              To vouch this, is no proof,[5134]
    Without more certain and more overt test[5135]
    Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods[5136]
    Of modern seeming do prefer against him.[5137]

    _First Sen._ But, Othello, speak:[5138]                          110
    Did you by indirect and forced courses
    Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
    Or came it by request, and such fair question
    As soul to soul affordeth?

    _Oth._                     I do beseech you,[5139]
    Send for the lady to the Sagittary,[5140]                        115
    And let her speak of me before her father:
    If you do find me foul in her report,
    The trust, the office I do hold of you,[5141]
    Not only take away, but let your sentence
    Even fall upon my life.[5142]

    _Duke._                 Fetch Desdemona hither.                  120

    _Oth._ Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.

                                   [_Exeunt Iago and Attendants._[5143]

    And till she come, as truly as to heaven[5144]
    I do confess the vices of my blood,[5145]
    So justly to your grave ears I'll present
    How I did thrive in this fair lady's love                        125
    And she in mine.

    _Duke._ Say it, Othello.

    _Oth._ Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    Still question'd me the story of my life[5146]
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,[5147]          130
    That I have pass'd.[5148]
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days[5149]
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,[5150]
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,[5151]                    135
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,[5152]
    Of being taken by the insolent foe,
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,[5153]
    And portance in my travels' history:[5154]
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,[5155]                   140
    Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,[5156]
    It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;[5157][5158][5159]
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,[5158][5160]
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads[5158][5161]
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear[5158][5162]        145
    Would Desdemona seriously incline:
    But still the house-affairs would draw her thence;[5163]
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,[5164]
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse: which I observing,                       150
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,[5165]
    But not intentively: I did consent,[5166]                        155
    And often did beguile her of her tears
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke[5167]
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,[5168]
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:[5169]
    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;[5170]  160
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,[5171]
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,                     165
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:[5172]
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,[5173]
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.                         170

            _Enter_ DESDEMONA, IAGO, _and_ Attendants.[5174]

    _Duke._ I think this tale would win my daughter too.[5175]
    Good Brabantio,[5176]
    Take up this mangled matter at the best:[5176]
    Men do their broken weapons rather use
    Than their bare hands.

    _Bra._                 I pray you, hear her speak:               175
    If she confess that she was half the wooer,
    Destruction on my head, if my bad blame[5177]
    Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
    Do you perceive in all this noble company[5178]
    Where most you owe obedience?

    _Des._                        My noble father,[5179]             180
    I do perceive here a divided duty:
    To you I am bound for life and education;[5180]
    My life and education both do learn me
    How to respect you; you are the lord of duty,[5181]
    I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,[5180]        185
    And so much duty as my mother show'd[5182]
    To you, preferring you before her father,
    So much I challenge that I may profess[5183]
    Due to the Moor my lord.

    _Bra._                   God be with you! I have done.[5184]
    Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:                   190
    I had rather to adopt a child than get it.[5185]
    Come hither, Moor:
    I here do give thee that with all my heart,
    Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart[5186]
    I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,[5187]              195
    I am glad at soul I have no other child;[5180][5188]
    For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
    To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.[5189]

    _Duke_. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence[5190]
    Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers[5191]           200
    Into your favour.[5192]
    When remedies are past, the griefs are ended[5193]
    By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.[5194]
    To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
    Is the next way to draw new mischief on.[5195]                   205
    What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,
    Patience her injury a mockery makes.[5196]
    The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;[5197]
    He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

    _Bra_. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;[5198]               210
    We lose it not so long as we can smile.[5199]
    He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears[5200]
    But the free comfort which from thence he hears;[5200]
    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow,[5201]
    That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.                215
    These sentences, to sugar or to gall,
    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
    But words are words; I never yet did hear
    That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.[5202]
    I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.[5203]     220

    _Duke._ The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes[5204]
    for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
    known to you; and though we have there a substitute of[5205]
    most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress[5206]
    of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must[5207]     225
    therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes[5208]
    with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition.[5209]

    _Oth._ The tyrant custom, most grave senators,[5210]
    Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war[5211]
    My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize                        230
    A natural and prompt alacrity[5212]
    I find in hardness; and do undertake[5213]
    These present wars against the Ottomites.[5214]
    Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
    I crave fit disposition for my wife,                             235
    Due reference of place and exhibition,[5215]
    With such accommodation and besort[5216]
    As levels with her breeding.

    _Duke._                      If you please,[5217]
    Be 't at her father's.[5217]

    _Bra._                 I'll not have it so.[5218]

    _Oth._ Nor I.

    _Des._        Nor I, I would not there reside,[5219]             240
    To put my father in impatient thoughts
    By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
    To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,[5220]
    And let me find a charter in your voice[5221]
    To assist my simpleness.[5222]                                   245

    _Duke._ What would you, Desdemona?[5223]

    _Des._ That I did love the Moor to live with him,[5224]
    My downright violence and storm of fortunes[5225]
    May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued[5226]
    Even to the very quality of my lord:[5227]                       250
    I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
    And to his honours and his valiant parts
    Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
    So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,[5228]
    A moth of peace, and he go to the war,                           255
    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,[5229]
    And I a heavy interim shall support
    By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

    _Oth._ Let her have your voices.[5230]
    Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,[5231]             260
    To please the palate of my appetite;
    Nor to comply with heat--the young affects[5232][5233]
    In me defunct--and proper satisfaction;[5232][5234]
    But to be free and bounteous to her mind:[5234][5235]
    And heaven defend your good souls, that you think[5236]          265
    I will your serious and great business scant[5237]
    For she is with me. No, when light-wing'd toys[5238]
    Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness[5239]
    My speculative and officed instruments,[5240]
    That my disports corrupt and taint my business,                  270
    Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,[5241]
    And all indign and base adversities
    Make head against my estimation![5242]

    _Duke._ Be it as you shall privately determine,
    Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,[5243]      275
    And speed must answer 't; you must hence to-night.[5244]

    _Des._ To-night, my lord?[5245]

    _Duke._                   This night.

    _Oth._                                With all my heart.

    _Duke._ At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.[5246]
    Othello, leave some officer behind,
    And he shall our commission bring to you;                        280
    With such things else of quality and respect[5247]
    As doth import you.

    _Oth._              So please your grace, my ancient;[5248]
    A man he is of honesty and trust:
    To his conveyance I assign my wife,
    With what else needful your good grace shall think[5249]         285
    To be sent after me.

    _Duke._              Let it be so.
    Good night to every one. [_To Brab._] And, noble signior,[5250]
    If virtue no delighted beauty lack,[5251]
    Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

    _First Sen._ Adieu, brave Moor; use Desdemona well.[5252]        290

    _Bra._ Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:[5253]
    She has deceived her father, and may thee.

                           [_Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, &c._[5254]

    _Oth._ My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
    My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
    I prithee, let thy wife attend on her;                           295
    And bring them after in the best advantage.[5255]
    Come, Desdemona; I have but an hour
    Of love, of worldly matters and direction,[5256]
    To spend with thee: we must obey the time.

                                 [_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona._[5257]

    _Rod._ Iago![5258]                                               300

    _Iago._ What say'st thou, noble heart?

    _Rod._ What will I do, thinkest thou?[5259]

    _Iago._ Why, go to bed and sleep.

    _Rod._ I will incontinently drown myself.

    _Iago._ If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,[5260]  305
    thou silly gentleman![5261]

    _Rod._ It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and[5262]
    then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.[5263]

    _Iago._ O villanous! I have looked upon the world for[5264]      310
    four times seven years; and since I could distinguish betwixt[5265]
    a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew[5266]
    how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself
    for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity[5267]
    with a baboon.                                                   315

    _Rod._ What should I do? I confess it is my shame to
    be so fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

    _Iago._ Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
    or thus. Our bodies are gardens; to the which our wills[5268]
    are gardeners: so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce,  320
    set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one[5269]
    gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have[5270]
    it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the
    power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If[5271]
    the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise[5272]  325
    another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures
    would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions: but we
    have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings,[5273]
    our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love,[5274]
    to be a sect or scion.[5275]                                     330

    _Rod._ It cannot be.

    _Iago._ It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission[5276]
    of the will. Come, be a man: drown thyself! drown cats
    and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I[5277]
    confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable       335
    toughness: I could never better stead thee than now. Put[5278]
    money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour[5279]
    with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse.
    It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love[5280]
    to the Moor--put money in thy purse--nor he his to her: it[5281]  340
    was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an[5282][5283]
    answerable sequestration; put but money in thy purse. These[5283][5284]
    Moors are changeable in their wills:--fill thy purse with
    money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts,[5285]
    shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.  She[5286][5287]  345
    must change for youth: when she is sated with his body,[5287]
    she will find the error of her choice: she must have change,[5288][5289]
    she must: therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt[5289]
    needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning.
    Make all the money thou canst: if sanctimony and a               350
    frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle[5290]
    Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of
    hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox
    of drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek thou[5291]
    rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be             355
    drowned and go without her.

    _Rod._ Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on[5292]
    the issue?[5292]

    _Iago._ Thou art sure of me: go, make money: I have
    told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate[5293]  360
    the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason.[5294]
    Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him: if thou[5295]
    canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport.[5296]
    There are many events in the womb of time, which will be
    delivered.  Traverse; go; provide thy money. We will             365
    have more of this to-morrow. Adieu.

    _Rod._ Where shall we meet i' the morning?

    _Iago._ At my lodging.

    _Rod._ I'll be with thee betimes.

    _Iago._ Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?[5297][5298]      370

    _Rod._ What say you?[5297]

    _Iago._ No more of drowning, do you hear?[5297]

    _Rod._ I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.  [_Exit._[5297][5299]

    _Iago._ Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;[5297][5300]
    For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,                  375
    If I would time expend with such a snipe[5301]
    But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor;
    And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets
    He has done my office: I know not if't be true;[5302]
    But I for mere suspicion in that kind[5303]                      380
    Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
    The better shall my purpose work on him.
    Cassio's a proper man: let me see now;
    To get his place, and to plume up my will[5304]
    In double knavery--How, how?--Let's see:--[5305]                 385
    After some time, to abuse Othello's ear[5306]
    That he is too familiar with his wife.[5307]
    He hath a person and a smooth dispose
    To be suspected; framed to make women false.
    The Moor is of a free and open nature,[5308]                     390
    That thinks men honest that but seem to be so;[5309]
    And will as tenderly be led by the nose[5310][5311]
    As asses are.[5310]
    I have 't. It is engender'd. Hell and night[5312]
    Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. [_Exit._[5313]  395

    If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,[5317][5319]

    On most part of their fleet.[5337]

    _Mon._ How! is this true?

    _Third Gent._         The ship is here put in,[5338][5339][5340]  25
    A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,[5338][5340]
    Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,[5341]
    Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,[5342]
    And is in full commission here for Cyprus.

    _Mon._ I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.[5343]              30

    _Third Gent._ But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
    Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly
    And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted[5344]
    With foul and violent tempest.

    _Mon._                         Pray heavens he be;[5345]
    For I have served him, and the man commands                       35
    Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho![5346]
    As well to see the vessel that's come in
    As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
    Even till we make the main and the aerial blue[5347][5348]
    An indistinct regard.[5347][5349]

    _Third Gent._         Come, let's do so;                          40
    For every minute is expectancy
    Of more arrivance.

                         _Enter_ CASSIO.[5350]

    _Cas._ Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,[5351]
    That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens[5352]
    Give him defence against the elements,[5353]                      45
    For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.[5354]

    _Mon._ Is he well shipp'd?

    _Cas._ His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot[5355]
    Of very expert and approved allowance;[5356]
    Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,[5357][5358]           50
    Stand in bold cure.[5358]

                              [_A cry within_: 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'

                   _Enter a fourth_ Gentleman.[5359]

    _Cas._ What noise?[5360]

    _Fourth Gent._ The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea[5361]
    Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'[5362]

    _Cas._ My hopes do shape him for the governor.                    55

                                                    [_Guns heard._[5363]

    _Sec. Gent._ They do discharge their shot of courtesy:[5364]
    Our friends at least.[5365]

    _Cas._                I pray you, sir, go forth,
    And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

    _Sec. Gent._ I shall.                                 [_Exit._[5366]

    _Mon._ But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?               60

    _Cas._ Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame;
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,[5367]
    And in the essential vesture of creation[5368]
    Does tire the ingener.

                      _Re-enter second_ Gentleman.

                           How now! who has put in?[5369]             65

    _Sec. Gent._ 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.[5366]

    _Cas._ He has had most favourable and happy speed:[5370]
    Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,[5371]
    The gutter'd rocks, and congregated sands,[5372]
    Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,[5373]              70
    As having sense of beauty, do omit
    Their mortal natures, letting go safely by[5374]
    The divine Desdemona.

    _Mon._                What is she?

    _Cas._ She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,[5375]
    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago;                             75
    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
    A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,[5376]
    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,[5377]                80
    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,[5378]
    And bring all Cyprus comfort.

   _Enter_ DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, _and_ Attendants.[5379]

                                  O, behold,
    The riches of the ship is come on shore![5380]
    Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.[5381]
    Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,[5382]                85
    Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
    Enwheel thee round!

    _Des._              I thank you, valiant Cassio.
    What tidings can you tell me of my lord?[5383]

    _Cas._ He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught[5384]
    But that he's well and will be shortly here.                      90

    _Des._ O, but I fear--How lost you company?[5385]

    _Cas_. The great contention of the sea and skies[5386]
    Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.

                  [_A cry within_: 'A sail, a sail!' _Guns heard._[5387]

    _Sec. Gent._ They give their greeting to the citadel:[5388]
    This likewise is a friend.

    _Cas._            See for the news.     [_Exit Gentleman._[5389]  95
    Good ancient, you are welcome. [_To Emilia_] Welcome, mistress:[5390]
    Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
    That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
    That gives me this bold show of courtesy.      [_Kissing her._[5391]

    _Iago._ Sir, would she give you so much of her lips[5392]        100
    As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,[5393]
    You'ld have enough.[5394]

    _Desd._             Alas, she has no speech.

    _Iago._ In faith, too much;[5395]
    I find it still when I have list to sleep:[5396]
    Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,                            105
    She puts her tongue a little in her heart[5397]
    And chides with thinking.

    _Emil._ You have little cause to say so.[5398]

    _Iago._ Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,[5399][5400]
    Bells in your parlours, wild-cats in your kitchens,[5399]        110
    Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,[5399]
    Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.[5399][5401]

    _Des._ O, fie upon thee, slanderer![5402]

    _Iago._ Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
    You rise to play, and go to bed to work.                         115

    _Emil._ You shall not write my praise.

    _Iago._                                No, let me not.

    _Des._ What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?[5403]

    _Iago._ O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
    For I am nothing if not critical.

    _Des._ Come on, assay--There's one gone to the harbour?[5404]    120

    _Iago._ Ay, madam.

    _Des._ I am not merry; but I do beguile
    The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
    Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

    _Iago._ I am about it; but indeed my invention[5405][5406]       125
    Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;[5405][5407]
    It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,[5405][5408]
    And thus she is deliver'd.[5405][5409]
    If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,[5410]
    The one's for use, the other useth it.[5410][5411]               130

    _Des._ Well praised! How if she be black and witty?[5412]

    _Iago._ If she be black, and thereto have a wit,[5410]
    She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.[5410][5413]

    _Des._ Worse and worse.

    _Emil._ How if fair and foolish?[5414]                           135

    _Iago._ She never yet was foolish that was fair;[5410][5415]
    For even her folly help'd her to an heir.[5410][5415][5416]

    _Des._ These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh[5417][5418]
    i' the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her[5417]
    that's foul and foolish?[5414][5417]                             140

    _Iago._ There's none so foul, and foolish thereunto,[5410]
    But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.[5410][5419]

    _Des._ O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.[5420]
    But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman
    indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly[5421][5422]  145
    put on the vouch of very malice itself?[5421][5423]

    _Iago._ She that was ever fair and never proud,[5410]
    Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,[5410]
    Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,[5410]
    Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may;'[5410]               150
    She that, being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,[5410][5424]
    Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;[5410]
    She that in wisdom never was so frail[5410]
    To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;[5410]
    She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,[5410][5425]    155
    See suitors following and not look behind;[5410][5426]
    She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--[5410][5427][5428]

    _Des._ To do what?[5428]

    _Iago._ To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.[5410]

    _Des._ O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn[5429]   160
    of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you,[5429]
    Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor?[5429][5430]

    _Cas._ He speaks home, madam: you may relish him[5431]
    more in the soldier than in the scholar.[5431][5432]

    _Iago._ [_Aside_] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,[5433]  165
    whisper: with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great[5434]
    a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee[5435]
    in thine own courtship. You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if[5436]
    such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it[5437]
    had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so[5438]   170
    oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in.[5439]
    Very good; well kissed! an excellent courtesy! 'tis so,[5440]
    indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? would they[5441]
    were clyster-pipes for your sake! [_Trumpet within._] The[5442]
    Moor! I know his trumpet.                                        175

    _Cas._ 'Tis truly so.

    _Des._ Let's meet him and receive him.

    _Cas._ Lo, where he comes!

                _Enter_ OTHELLO _and_ Attendants.[5443]

    _Oth._ O my fair warrior!

    _Des._                    My dear Othello!

    _Oth._ It gives me wonder great as my content                    180
    To see you here before me. O my soul's joy![5444]
    If after every tempest come such calms,[5445]
    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death![5446]
    And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
    Olympus-high and duck again as low                               185
    As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,[5447]
    'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear,
    My soul hath her content so absolute
    That not another comfort like to this
    Succeeds in unknown fate.

    _Des._                    The heavens forbid                     190
    But that our loves and comforts should increase,[5448]
    Even as our days do grow!

    _Oth._                    Amen to that, sweet powers![5449]
    I cannot speak enough of this content;
    It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
    And this, and this, the greatest discords be [_Kissing her._[5450]  195
    That e'er our hearts shall make!

    _Iago._            [_Aside_]  O, you are well tuned now![5451][5452]
    But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,[5452][5453]
    As honest as I am.[5452]

    _Oth._             Come, let us to the castle.[5454]
    News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.[5455]
    How does my old acquaintance of this isle?[5456]                 200
    Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
    I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,[5457]
    I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
    In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,[5458]
    Go to the bay, and disembark my coffers:[5459]                   205
    Bring thou the master to the citadel;
    He is a good one, and his worthiness
    Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
    Once more well met at Cyprus.

                             [_Exeunt all but Iago and Roderigo._[5460]

    _Iago._ Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come[5461]     210
    hither. If thou be'st valiant--as, they say, base men being[5462][5463]
    in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is[5463]
    native to them--list me. The lieutenant to-night watches[5463][5464]
    on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona[5465]
    is directly in love with him.                                    215

    _Rod._ With him! why, 'tis not possible.

    _Iago._ Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.[5466]
    Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but[5467]
    for bragging and telling her fantastical lies: and will she[5468]
    love him still for prating? let not thy discreet heart
        think[5468][5469]                                            220
    it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have[5470]
    to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the
    act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give[5471]
    satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in[5472]
    years, manners and beauties; all which the Moor is defective     225
    in: now, for want of these required conveniences, her
    delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave
    the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will[5473]
    instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice.[5474]
    Now, sir, this granted--as it is a most pregnant and unforced[5475]  230
    position--who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune[5476]
    as Cassio does? a knave very voluble; no further conscionable[5477]
    than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane[5478]
    seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most[5478][5479][5480]
    hidden loose affection? why, none; why, none: a slipper
        and[5479][5481][5482]                                        235
    subtle knave; a finder out of occasions; that has an eye can[5482][5483]
    stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage[5484]
    never present itself: a devilish knave! Besides, the knave[5484][5485]
    is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him
    that folly and green minds look after: a pestilent complete[5486]  240
    knave; and the woman hath found him already.[5487]

    _Rod._ I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most[5488]
    blest condition.[5489][5490]

    _Iago._ Blest fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of[5489][5491]
    grapes: if she had been blest, she would never have loved[5489]  245
    the Moor: blest pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle[5489][5492]
    with the palm of his hand? didst not mark that?[5493]

    _Rod._ Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.[5494]

    _Iago._ Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue[5495]
    to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so            250
    near with their lips that their breaths embraced together.
    Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these mutualities so[5496]
    marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main[5497]
    exercise, the incorporate conclusion: pish! But, sir, be you[5498]
    ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice. Watch               255
    you to-night; for the command, I'll lay't upon you: Cassio[5499]
    knows you not: I'll not be far from you: do you find some
    occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud or
    tainting his discipline, or from what other course you[5500]
    please, which the time shall more favourably minister.           260

    _Rod._ Well.

    _Iago._ Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and[5501]
    haply may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for[5502]
    even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny;[5503]
    whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but[5504]  265
    by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter[5505]
    journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to
    prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed,[5506]
    without the which there were no expectation of our
    prosperity.[5507]                                                270

    _Rod._ I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.[5508]

    _Iago._ I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the
    citadel: I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

    _Rod._ Adieu.                                         [_Exit._[5509]

    _Iago._ That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;[5510]       275
    That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
    The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
    Is of a constant, loving, noble nature;[5511]
    And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
    A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,[5512]               280
    Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
    I stand accountant for as great a sin,
    But partly led to diet my revenge,[5513]
    For that I do suspect the lusty Moor[5514]
    Hath leap'd into my seat: the thought whereof[5515]              285
    Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards;
    And nothing can or shall content my soul[5516]
    Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife;[5517]
    Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
    At least into a jealousy so strong[5518]                         290
    That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,
    If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash[5519]
    For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
    I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
    Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb;[5520]                    295
    For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too;[5521]
    Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me,
    For making him egregiously an ass
    And practising upon his peace and quiet
    Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:                    300
    Knavery's plain face is never seen till used.               [_Exit._


SCENE II. _A street._

    _Enter a_ Herald _with a proclamation; People following_.[5522]

    _Her._ It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
    general, that upon certain tidings now arrived, importing
    the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put[5523]
    himself into triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires,[5524]
    each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads[5525]        5
    him: for, besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration[5526]
    of his nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed.[5527]
    All offices are open, and there is full liberty of[5528]
    feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have[5528][5529]
    told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our[5530]        10
    noble general Othello!                              [_Exeunt._[5531]


SCENE III. _A hall in the castle._

      _Enter_ OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, _and_ Attendants.[5532]

    _Oth._ Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
    Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,[5533]
    Not to outsport discretion.

    _Cas._ Iago hath direction what to do;[5534]
    But notwithstanding with my personal eye                           5
    Will I look to't.[5535]

    _Oth._            Iago is most honest.
    Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest[5536]
    Let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love,[5537]
    The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
    That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.[5538]                10
    Good night.      [_Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants._[5539]

                             _Enter_ IAGO.

    _Cas._ Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

    _Iago._ Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the[5540]
    clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his[5540]
    Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame: he hath not yet[5541]  15
    made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove.

    _Cas._ She's a most exquisite lady.[5542]

    _Iago._ And, I'll warrant her, full of game.

    _Cas._ Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.[5543]

    _Iago._ What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley[5544][5545]  20
    to provocation.[5544][5546]

    _Cas._ An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.[5547]

    _Iago._ And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?[5547][5548]

    _Cas._ She is indeed perfection.

    _Iago._ Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,        25
    I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace of[5549]
    Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the[5550]
    health of black Othello.[5551]

    _Cas._ Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
    unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy           30
    would invent some other custom of entertainment.

    _Iago._ O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink
    for you.

    _Cas._ I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was[5552]
    craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes[5553]  35
    here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task[5554]
    my weakness with any more.

    _Iago._ What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
    desire it.

    _Cas._ Where are they?                                            40

    _Iago._ Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

    _Cas._ I'll do't; but it dislikes me.                       [_Exit._

    _Iago._ If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offence                           45
    As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,[5555]
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,[5556]
    To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,[5557]               50
    That hold their honours in a wary distance,[5558]
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,[5559]
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action[5560]                       55
    That may offend the isle. But here they come:[5561]
    If consequence do but approve my dream,[5562]
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

    _Re-enter_ CASSIO; _with him_ MONTANO _and_ Gentlemen; _Servants
                      following with wine._[5563]

    _Cas._ 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.[5564]

    _Mon._ Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am[5565]   60
    a soldier.[5565]

    _Iago._ Some wine, ho!
    [_Sings_] And let me the canakin clink, clink;[5566][5567][5568]
                And let me the canakin clink:[5567][5569]
                  A soldier's a man;[5567][5570]                      65
                  A life's but a span;[5567][5570][5571]
                Why then let a soldier drink.[5567]
    Some wine, boys![5572]

    _Cas._ 'Fore God, an excellent song.[5573]

    _Iago._ I learned it in England, where indeed they are            70
    most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
    your swag-bellied Hollander,--Drink, ho!--are nothing to
    your English.[5574]

    _Cas._ Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?[5575]

    _Iago._ Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead           75
    drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives[5576]
    your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.

    _Cas._ To the health of our general!

    _Mon._ I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.[5577]

    _Iago._ O sweet England!                                          80
    [_Sings_] King Stephen was a worthy peer,[5578]
                  His breeches cost him but a crown;[5567]
                He held them sixpence all too dear,[5567][5579]
                  With that he call'd the tailor lown.[5567]

                He was a wight of high renown,[5567]                  85
                   And thou art but of low degree:[5567]
                'Tis pride that pulls the country down;[5567]
                   Then take thine auld cloak about thee.[5567][5580]
    Some wine, ho!

    _Cas._ Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.[5581]   90

    _Iago._ Will you hear't again?

    _Cas._ No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place[5582]
    that does those things. Well: God's above all; and[5583]
    there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must[5584][5585]
    not be saved.[5585]                                               95

    _Iago._ It's true, good lieutenant.[5586]

    _Cas._ For mine own part--no offence to the general, nor
    any man of quality--I hope to be saved.

    _Iago._ And so do I too, lieutenant.[5587]

    _Cas._ Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant     100
    is to be saved before the ancient. Let's have no[5588]
    more of this; let's to our affairs. God forgive us our sins![5589]
    Gentlemen, let's look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen,
    I am drunk: this is my ancient: this is my right
    hand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now; I can[5590]       105
    stand well enough, and speak well enough.[5591]

    _All._ Excellent well.[5592]

    _Cas._ Why, very well then; you must not think then[5593]
    that I am drunk.                                      [_Exit._[5594]

    _Mon._ To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.[5595]  110

    _Iago._ You see this fellow that is gone before;
    He is a soldier fit to stand by Cæsar[5596]
    And give direction: and do but see his vice;
    'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,[5597]
    The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.                  115
    I fear the trust Othello puts him in[5598]
    On some odd time of his infirmity
    Will shake this island.[5599]

    _Mon._                  But is he often thus?

    _Iago._ 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:[5600]
    He'll watch the horologe a double set,[5601]                     120
    If drink rock not his cradle.

    _Mon._                        It were well[5602]
    The general were put in mind of it.[5603]
    Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio[5604]
    And looks not on his evils: is not this true?                    125

                        _Enter_ RODERIGO.[5605]

    _Iago._ [_Aside to him_] How now, Roderigo![5606]
    I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.        [_Exit Roderigo._[5607]

    _Mon._ And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
    Should hazard such a place as his own second
    With one of an ingraft infirmity:[5608]                          130
    It were an honest action to say[5609]
    So to the Moor.[5609][5610]

    _Iago._         Not I, for this fair island:
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil:--But, hark! what noise?

                                          [_A cry within_: 'Help! help!'

    _Cas._ 'Zounds! you rogue! you rascal![5612]                     135

    _Mon._ What's the matter, lieutenant?

    _Cas._ A knave teach me my duty! But I'll beat the[5613][5614]
    knave into a wicker bottle.[5613][5615]

    _Rod._ Beat me![5613][5616]

    _Cas._ Dost thou prate, rogue? [_Striking Roderigo._[5613][5617]  140

    _Mon._ Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold[5613][5618]
    your hand.[5613]

    _Cas._ Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.[5613][5619]

    _Mon._ Come, come, you're drunk.[5613][5620]                     145

    _Cas._ Drunk!                                   [_They fight._[5621]

    _Iago._ [_Aside to Roderigo_] Away, I say; go out, and
              cry a mutiny.                      [_Exit Roderigo._[5622]
    Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen![5623]
    Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano--sir;--[5624]

    Who's that that rings the bell?--Diablo, ho![5626]

    You will be shamed for ever.

                  _Re-enter_ OTHELLO _and_ Attendants.

    _Oth._                       What is the matter here?[5628]

    _Mon._ 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death

    _Iago._ Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--gentlemen,--[5630]
    Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?[5631]
    Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame![5632]

    _Oth._ Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?[5633]
    Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that                    160
    Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?[5634]
    For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
    He that stirs next to carve for his own rage[5635]
    Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
    Silence that dreadful bell! it frights the isle                  165
    From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?[5636]
    Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,[5637]
    Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.[5638]

    _Iago._ I do not know: friends all but now, even now,[5639]
    In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom                    170
    Devesting them for bed; and then, but now,[5640]
    As if some planet had unwitted men,[5641]
    Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,[5642]
    In opposition bloody. I cannot speak[5643]
    Any beginning to this peevish odds;                              175
    And would in action glorious I had lost
    Those legs that brought me to a part of it![5644]

    _Oth._ How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?[5645]

    _Cas._ I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

    _Oth._ Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;[5646][5647]       180
    The gravity and stillness of your youth
    The world hath noted, and your name is great
    In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,[5648]
    That you unlace your reputation thus,[5649]
    And spend your rich opinion for the name                         185
    Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.[5650]

    _Mon._ Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
    Your officer, Iago, can inform you--
    While I spare speech, which something now offends me--[5651]
    Of all that I do know: nor know I aught                          190
    By me that's said or done amiss this night;[5652]
    Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,[5653]
    And to defend ourselves it be a sin
    When violence assails us.

    _Oth._                    Now, by heaven,
    My blood begins my safer guides to rule,                         195
    And passion, having my best judgement collied,[5654]
    Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,[5655]
    Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
    Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
    How this foul rout began, who set it on,                         200
    And he that is approved in this offence,[5656]
    Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
    Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,[5657]
    Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
    To manage private and domestic quarrel,[5658]                    205
    In night, and on the court and guard of safety![5659]
    'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?[5660]

    _Mon._ If partially affined, or leagued in office,[5661]
    Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
    Thou art no soldier.[5662]

    _Iago._              Touch me not so near:                       210
    I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth[5663]
    Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
    Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth[5664]
    Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.[5665]
    Montano and myself being in speech,                              215
    There comes a fellow crying out for help,
    And Cassio following him with determined sword,[5666]
    To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
    Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause:[5667]
    Myself the crying fellow did pursue,                             220
    Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
    The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
    Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather[5668]
    For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
    And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night[5669]               225
    I ne'er might say before. When I came back--[5670]
    For this was brief--I found them close together,
    At blow and thrust; even as again they were
    When you yourself did part them.
    More of this matter cannot I report:[5671]                       230
    But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
    Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
    As men in rage strike those that wish them best,[5672]
    Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
    From him that fled some strange indignity,                       235
    Which patience could not pass.

    _Oth._                         I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee;
    But never more be officer of mine.

                _Re-enter_ DESDEMONA, _attended_.[5673]

    Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!                        240
    I'll make thee an example.

    _Des._                     What's the matter?[5674]

    _Oth._ All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.[5675][5676]
    Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:[5675]
    Lead him off.             [_To Montano, who is led off._[5675][5677]
    Iago, look with care about the town,                             245
    And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.[5678]
    Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life
    To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

    _Cas._ Ay, past all surgery.[5681]                               250

    _Iago._ Marry, heaven forbid![5682]

    _Cas._ Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost[5683][5684][5685]
    my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself,
        and[5683][5685][5686]
    what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my[5683]
    reputation![5683]                                                255

    _Iago._ As I am an honest man, I thought you had received[5687]
    some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in[5688]
    reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition;
    oft got without merit and lost without deserving: you have
    lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a     260
    loser. What, man! there are ways to recover the general[5689]
    again: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment
    more in policy than in malice; even so as one would beat his
    offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue to him[5690]
    again, and he's yours.                                           265

    _Cas._ I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
    good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet[5691]
    an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble?[5692][5693]
    swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with one's own shadow?[5692]
    O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name[5692][5694]  270
    to be known by, let us call thee devil!

    _Iago._ What was he that you followed with your sword?
    What had he done to you?

    _Cas._ I know not.

    _Iago._ Is't possible?                                           275

    _Cas._ I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly,
    a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should[5695]
    put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!
    that we should, with joy, pleasance, revel and applause,[5696]
    transform ourselves into beasts!                                 280

    _Iago._ Why, but you are now well enough: how came
    you thus recovered?

    _Cas._ It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
    to the devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to
    make me frankly despise myself.                                  285

    _Iago._ Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
    the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could[5697]
    heartily wish this had not befallen; but since it is as it is,[5698]
    mend it for your own good.

    _Cas._ I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me       290
    I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such
    an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man,[5699]
    by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every[5700]
    inordinate cup is unblest, and the ingredient is a devil.[5701]

    _Iago._ Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,[5702]  295
    if it be well used: exclaim no more against it. And, good
    lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

    _Cas._ I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!

    _Iago._ You or any man living may be drunk at some time,[5703]
    man. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife[5704]   300
    is now the general. I may say so in this respect, for that
    he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation,[5705]
    mark and denotement of her parts and graces: confess[5706]
    yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in[5707]
    your place again: she is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed[5708]  305
    a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do[5709]
    more than she is requested: this broken joint between you[5710]
    and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my fortunes
    against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall
    grow stronger than it was before.[5711]                          310

    _Cas._ You advise me well.

    _Iago._ I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest[5712]
    kindness.

    _Cas._ I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I[5713]
    will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:[5713]   315
    I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.[5714]

    _Iago._ You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I[5715]
    must to the watch.[5715]

    _Cas._ Good night, honest Iago.                       [_Exit._[5716]

    _Iago._ And what's he then that says I play the villain?[5717]   320
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the course[5718]
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy[5719]
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue[5720]
    In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful[5720]               325
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,[5721]
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,                     330
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain[5722]
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,[5723]
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell![5723][5724]
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,[5725]                 335
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now: for whiles this honest fool[5726]
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,[5727]
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,                          340
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;[5728]
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch;
    And out of her own goodness make the net                         345
    That shall enmesh them all.

                        _Enter_ RODERIGO.[5729]

                                How now, Roderigo!

    _Rod._ I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that[5730]
    hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost
    spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled;[5731]
    and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much[5732]        350
    experience for my pains; and so, with no money at all and a[5733]
    little more wit, return again to Venice.[5733]

    _Iago._ How poor are they that have not patience!
    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,[5734]         355
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,[5735]
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio:[5736]
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,[5737]
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:[5738]          360
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;[5739]
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.[5740]
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
    Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
    Nay, get thee gone. [_Exit Rod._] Two things are to be done:[5741]  365
    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
    I'll set her on;[5742][5743][5744][5745]
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,[5743][5745][5746]
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find[5747]
    Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way;                         370
    Dull not device by coldness and delay.                [_Exit._[5748]

    likes your music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to[5759]
    make no more noise with it.[5760]

    _First Mus._ Well, sir, we will not.

    _Clo._ If you have any music that may not be heard,               15
    to 't again: but, as they say, to hear music the general
    does not greatly care.

    _First Mus._ We have none such, sir.[5761]

    _Clo._ Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:[5762]

    her a little favour of speech: wilt thou do this?[5767]

    _Clo._ She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I shall

    _Cas._ Why, no; the day had broke[5773]
    Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,[5772][5773][5774]
    To send in to your wife: my suit to her[5773][5775]
    Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona[5773][5776]

    _Iago._                 I'll send her to you presently;[5777]     35

    Out of the way, that your converse and business
    May be more free.

                knew[5778][5779]

                            _Enter_ EMILIA.

    _Emil._ Good morrow, good lieutenant: I am sorry
    For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.[5781]
    The general and his wife are talking of it,
    And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
    That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus                       45
    And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom[5782]
    He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you,[5783]
    And needs no other suitor but his likings[5784]
    To take the safest occasion by the front[5785]
    To bring you in again.

    _Cas._                 Yet, I beseech you,                        50
    If you think fit, or that it may be done,
    Give me advantage of some brief discourse
    With Desdemona alone.

    I will bestow you where you shall have time

    All my abilities in thy behalf.

    _Emil._ Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband[5794]
    As if the case were his.[5795]

    _Des._ O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,[5796]     5
    But I will have my lord and you again
    As friendly as you were.

    _Cas._                   Bounteous madam,[5797]
    Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
    He's never any thing but your true servant.

    _Des._ I know't: I thank you. You do love my lord:[5798]          10
    You have known him long; and be you well assured[5799]
    He shall in strangeness stand no farther off[5800]
    Than in a politic distance.

    _Cas._                      Ay, but, lady,
    That policy may either last so long,[5801]
    Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,                         15
    Or breed itself so out of circumstance,[5802]
    That, I being absent and my place supplied,
    My general will forget my love and service.[5803]

    _Des._ Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
    I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,[5804]              20
    If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
    To the last article: my lord shall never rest;[5805]
    I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
    I'll intermingle every thing he does                              25
    With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
    For thy solicitor shall rather die
    Than give thy cause away.[5806]

           _Enter_ OTHELLO _and_ IAGO, _at a distance_.[5807]

    _Emil._ Madam, here comes my lord.

    _Cas._ Madam, I'll take my leave.                                 30

    _Des._ Nay, stay and hear me speak.[5808]

    _Cas._ Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,[5809]
    Unfit for mine own purposes.[5810]

    _Des._ Well, do your discretion.               [_Exit Cassio._[5811]

    _Iago._ Ha! I like not that.                                      35

    _Oth._ What dost thou say?

    _Iago._ Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.[5812]

    _Oth._ Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

    _Iago._ Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,[5813]
    That he would steal away so guilty-like,[5814]                    40
    Seeing you coming.

    _Oth._             I do believe 'twas he.[5815][5816]

    _Des._ How now, my lord![5816][5817]
    I have been talking with a suitor here,
    A man that languishes in your displeasure.

    _Oth._ Who is't you mean?                                         45

    _Des._ Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,[5818]
    If I have any grace or power to move you,
    His present reconciliation take;[5819]
    For if he be not one that truly loves you,
    That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,                        50
    I have no judgement in an honest face:
    I prithee, call him back.

    _Oth._                    Went he hence now?[5820]

    _Des._ Ay, sooth; so humbled,[5820][5821]
    That he hath left part of his grief with me,[5822]
    To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.[5823]               55

    _Oth._ Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.[5824]

    _Des._ But shall't be shortly?

    _Oth._                         The sooner, sweet, for you.[5825]

    _Des._ Shall't be to-night at supper?

    _Oth._                                No, not to-night.[5826]

    _Des._ To-morrow dinner then?

    _Oth._                        I shall not dine at home;
    I meet the captains at the citadel.                               60

    _Des._ Why then to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;[5827]
    On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:[5828]
    I prithee, name the time; but let it not[5829]
    Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;[5830]
    And yet his trespass, in our common reason--                      65
    Save that, they say, the wars must make examples[5831]
    Out of their best--is not almost a fault[5832]
    To incur a private check. When shall he come?
    Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
    What you would ask me, that I should deny,[5833]                  70
    Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,[5834]
    That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time[5835]
    When I have spoke of you dispraisingly
    Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
    To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much--[5836]                75

    _Oth._ Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
    I will deny thee nothing.

    _Des._                    Why, this is not a boon;
    'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,[5837]
    Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,[5838]
    Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit[5839]                       80
    To your own person: nay, when I have a suit[5840]
    Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
    It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,[5841]
    And fearful to be granted.

    _Oth._                     I will deny thee nothing:
    Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,                        85
    To leave me but a little to myself.

    _Des._ Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

    _Oth._ Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.[5842]

    _Des._ Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;[5843]
    Whate'er you be, I am obedient.                                   90

                                   [_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia._[5844]

    _Oth._ Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,[5845]
    But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
    Chaos is come again.

    _Iago._ My noble lord,--[5846]

    _Oth._                   What dost thou say, Iago?

    _Iago._ Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,[5847][5848]   95
    Know of your love?[5847]

    _Oth._ He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?[5849]

    _Iago._ But for a satisfaction of my thought;[5850]
    No further harm.

    _Oth._           Why of thy thought, Iago?

    _Iago._ I did not think he had been acquainted with her.[5851]   100

    _Oth._ O, yes, and went between us very oft.[5852]

    _Iago._ Indeed!

    _Oth._ Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?[5853]
    Is he not honest?

    _Iago._ Honest, my lord!                                         105

    _Oth._ Honest! ay, honest.[5854]

    _Iago._ My lord, for aught I know.

    _Oth._ What dost thou think?

    _Iago._ Think, my lord!

    _Oth._ Think, my lord! By heaven, he echoes me,[5855]            110
    As if there were some monster in his thought[5856]
    Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:[5857]
    I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,[5858]
    When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
    And when I told thee he was of my counsel                        115
    In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'[5859]
    And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
    As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
    Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,[5860]
    Show me thy thought.                                             120

    _Iago._ My lord, you know I love you.

    _Oth._                                I think thou dost;
    And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty[5861]
    And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,[5862]
    Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:[5863]
    For such things in a false disloyal knave                        125
    Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just
    They're close delations, working from the heart,[5864]
    That passion cannot rule.

    _Iago._                   For Michael Cassio,
    I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.[5865]

    _Oth._ I think so too.

    _Iago._                Men should be what they seem;[5866]       130
    Or those that be not, would they might seem none![5867]

    _Oth._ Certain, men should be what they seem.[5868]

    _Iago._ Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.[5869]

    _Oth._ Nay, yet there's more in this:
    I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,[5870]                135
    As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts[5871]
    The worst of words.[5872]

    _Iago._             Good my lord, pardon me:
    Though I am bound to every act of duty,[5873]
    I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.[5874]
    Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;[5875]       140
    As where's that palace whereinto foul things
    Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,[5876]
    But some uncleanly apprehensions[5877]
    Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit[5878]
    With meditations lawful?                                         145

    _Oth._ Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
    If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear[5879]
    A stranger to thy thoughts.

    _Iago._                     I do beseech you--[5880]
    Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,[5880][5881]
    As, I confess, it is my nature's plague                          150
    To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy[5882][5883]
    Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,[5883][5884]
    From one that so imperfectly conceits,[5885]
    Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble[5886]
    Out of his scattering and unsure observance.[5887]               155
    It were not for your quiet nor your good,
    Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,[5888]
    To let you know my thoughts.

    _Oth._                       What dost thou mean?[5889]

    _Iago._ Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,[5890]
    Is the immediate jewel of their souls:[5891]                     160
    Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;[5892]
    'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
    But he that filches from me my good name
    Robs me of that which not enriches him[5893]
    And makes me poor indeed.                                        165

    _Oth._ By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.[5894]

    _Iago._ You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
    Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

    _Oth._ Ha!

    _Iago._    O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;[5895]
    It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock[5896][5897]        170
    The meat it feeds on: that cuckold lives in bliss[5897][5898]
    Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;[5899]
    But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves![5900]

    _Oth._ O misery!                                                 175

    _Iago._ Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
    But riches fineless is as poor as winter[5901]
    To him that ever fears he shall be poor:
    Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend[5902]
    From jealousy!

    _Oth._         Why, why is this?[5903]                           180
    Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy,
    To follow still the changes of the moon
    With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
    Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,[5904]
    When I shall turn the business of my soul                        185
    To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,[5905]
    Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous[5906]
    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
    Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;[5907]
    Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:[5908]                  190
    Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
    The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
    For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;[5909]
    I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
    And on the proof, there is no more but this,                     195
    Away at once with love or jealousy![5910]

    _Iago._ I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason[5911][5912]
    To show the love and duty that I bear you
    With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,[5911]
    Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.[5913]              200
    Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
    Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:[5914]
    I would not have your free and noble nature
    Out of self-bounty be abused; look to't:
    I know our country disposition well;                             205
    In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks[5915]
    They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience[5916]
    Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.[5917]

    _Oth._ Dost thou say so?[5918]

    _Iago._ She did deceive her father, marrying you;                210
    And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
    She loved them most.

    _Oth._               And so she did.

    _Iago._                              Why, go to then;[5919]
    She that so young could give out such a seeming,
    To seel her father's eyes up close as oak--[5920]
    He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;[5911][5921]  215
    I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
    For too much loving you.

    _Oth._                   I am bound to thee for ever.[5911][5922]

    _Iago._ I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

    _Oth._ Not a jot, not a jot.

    _Iago._                      I'faith, I fear it has.[5923]
    I hope you will consider what is spoke                           220
    Comes from my love; but I do see you're moved:[5924]
    I am to pray you not to strain my speech
    To grosser issues nor to larger reach
    Than to suspicion.

    _Oth._ I will not.

    _Iago._            Should you do so, my lord,                    225
    My speech should fall into such vile success[5925]
    As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--[5926]
    My lord, I see you're moved.[5927]

    _Oth._                       No, not much moved:
    I do not think but Desdemona's honest.[5928]

    _Iago._ Long live she so! and long live you to think so![5929]   230

    _Oth._ And yet, how nature erring from itself--[5930]

    _Iago._ Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--[5931]
    Not to affect many proposed matches
    Of her own clime, complexion and degree,
    Whereto we see in all things nature tends--[5932]                235
    Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,[5933]
    Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.[5934]
    But pardon me: I do not in position[5935]
    Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear[5936]
    Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,                     240
    May fall to match you with her country forms,[5937]
    And happily repent.

    _Oth._              Farewell, farewell:[5938]
    If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
    Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago.[5939]

    _Iago._ [_Going_] My lord, I take my leave.[5940]                245

    _Oth._ Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless[5941]
    Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

    _Iago._ [_Returning_] My lord, I would I might entreat
                your honour[5942][5943]
    To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:[5943][5944]
    Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,[5945]               250
    For sure he fills it up with great ability,
    Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,[5946]
    You shall by that perceive him and his means:
    Note if your lady strain his entertainment[5947]
    With any strong or vehement importunity;                         255
    Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
    Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
    As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
    And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

    _Oth._ Fear not my government.                                   260

    _Iago._ I once more take my leave.                    [_Exit._[5948]

    _Oth._ This fellow's of exceeding honesty,[5949]
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,[5950][5951]
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,[5951][5952]
    Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings,               265
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind[5953]
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black[5911][5954]
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--[5955]             270
    She's gone; I am abused, and my relief[5956]
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,[5957]
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,[5958]                     275
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love[5959]
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;[5960]
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;[5961]
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:[5962]
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us                      280
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:

                _Re-enter_ DESDEMONA _and_ EMILIA.[5963]

    If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself![5964]
    I'll not believe 't.[5965]

    _Des._               How now, my dear Othello!
    Your dinner, and the generous islanders[5966]
    By you invited, do attend your presence.                         285

    _Oth._ I am to blame.

    _Des._                     Why do you speak so faintly?[5967][5968]
    Are you not well?[5968]

    _Oth._ I have a pain upon my forehead here.[5969]

    _Des._ Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:[5970]
    Let me but bind it hard, within this hour[5971]                  290
    It will be well.

    _Oth._           Your napkin is too little;

           [_He puts the handkerchief from him; and she drops it._[5972]

    Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

    _Des._ I am very sorry that you are not well.

                                  [_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona._[5973]

    _Emil._ I am glad I have found this napkin:[5974]
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor:                    295
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,[5975]
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,[5976][5977][5978]  300
    And give 't Iago: what he will do with it[5976][5978][5979]
    Heaven knows, not I;[5976]
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.

                         _Re-enter_ IAGO.[5980]

    _Iago._ How now! what do you here alone?

    _Emil._ Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.[5981]          305

    _Iago._ A thing for me? it is a common thing--[5981][5982]

    _Emil._ Ha!

    _Iago._ To have a foolish wife.[5983]

    _Emil._ O, is that all? What will you give me now
    For that same handkerchief?

    _Iago._                     What handkerchief?[5984]             310

    _Emil._ What handkerchief![5984]
    Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
    That which so often you did bid me steal.

    _Iago._ Hast stol'n it from her?[5985]

    _Emil._ No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,[5986]          315
    And, to the advantage, I being here took 't up.[5987]
    Look, here it is.[5988]

    _Iago._           A good wench; give it me.

    _Emil._ What will you do with 't, that you have been so
            earnest[5989][5990]
    To have me filch it?[5989]

    _Iago._              [_Snatching it_] Why, what's that to you?[5991]

    _Emil._ If 't be not for some purpose of import,[5992]           320
    Give 't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad[5993]
    When she shall lack it.

    _Iago._ Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.[5994][5995]
    Go, leave me.                                  [_Exit Emilia._[5994]
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,[5996]               325
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.[5997]
    The Moor already changes with my poison:[5998]
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,[5999]           330
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood[6000]
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so:[6001]
    Look, where he comes!

                       _Re-enter_ OTHELLO.[6002]

                          Not poppy, nor mandragora,
    Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,[6003]                    335
    Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
    Which thou owedst yesterday.

    _Oth._                       Ha! ha! false to me?[6004]

    _Iago._ Why, how now, general! no more of that.

    _Oth._ Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:[6005]
    I swear 'tis better to be much abused                            340
    Than but to know 't a little.

    _Iago._                       How now, my lord![6006]

    _Oth._ What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?[6007]
    I saw 't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:[6008]
    I slept the next night well, was free and merry;[6009]
    I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:                         345
    He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
    Let him not know 't and he's not robb'd at all.

    _Iago._ I am sorry to hear this.

    _Oth._ I had been happy, if the general camp,
    Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,[6010]                350
    So I had nothing known. O, now for ever
    Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
    Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars[6011]
    That make ambition virtue! O, farewell,[6012]
    Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,                355
    The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,[6013]
    The royal banner and all quality,
    Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
    And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats[6014]
    The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,[6015]            360
    Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

    _Iago._ Is't possible, my lord?[6016]

    _Oth._ Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;[6017]
    Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof;[6018]
    Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul,[6019]                    365
    Thou hadst been better have been born a dog[6020]
    Than answer my waked wrath![6021]

    _Iago._                     Is't come to this?

    _Oth._ Make me to see 't; or at the least so prove it,
    That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
    To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!                        370

    _Iago._ My noble lord,--[6022]

    _Oth._ If thou dost slander her and torture me,
    Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
    On horror's head horrors accumulate;[6023]
    Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;                  375
    For nothing canst thou to damnation add[6024]
    Greater than that.[6024]

    _Iago._            O grace! O heaven defend me![6025]
    Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
    God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool,[6026]
    That livest to make thine honesty a vice![6027]                  380
    O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,[6028]
    To be direct and honest is not safe.
    I thank you for this profit, and from hence
    I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence.[6029]

    _Oth._ Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.[6030]                 385

    _Iago._ I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
    And loses that it works for.[6031]

    _Oth._                       By the world,[6032]
    I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;[6032][6033]
    I think that thou art just, and think thou art not:[6032]
    I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh[6032][6034]    390
    As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black[6032]
    As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,[6032]
    Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,[6032][6035]
    I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied![6032]

    _Iago._ I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:[6032][6036]   395
    I do repent me that I put it to you.
    You would be satisfied?

    _Oth._                  Would! nay, I will.[6037]

    _Iago._ And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
    Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?[6038]
    Behold her topp'd?[6039]

    _Oth._             Death and damnation! O!                       400

    _Iago._ It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
    To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,[6040]
    If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster[6041]
    More than their own! What then? how then?[6042]
    What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?[6043]                    405
    It is impossible you should see this,
    Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,[6044]
    As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
    As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
    If imputation and strong circumstances,                          410
    Which lead directly to the door of truth,
    Will give you satisfaction, you may have 't.[6045]

    _Oth._ Give me a living reason she's disloyal.[6046]

    _Iago._ I do not like the office:
    But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,[5911][6047]          415
    Prick'd to 't by foolish honesty and love,
    I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,[6048]
    And being troubled with a raging tooth,[6049]
    I could not sleep.[6049]
    There are a kind of men so loose of soul,[6049]                  420
    That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:[6049][6050]
    One of this kind is Cassio:[6049]
    In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
    Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'[6051]
    And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,                 425
    Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,[6052]
    As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,
    That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg[6053][6054]
    Over my thigh, and sigh'd and kiss'd, and then[6053][6055]
    Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'[6053][6055]      430

    _Oth._ O monstrous! monstrous!

    _Iago._                        Nay, this was but his dream.[6056]

    _Oth._ But this denoted a foregone conclusion:[6057]
    'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.[6058]

    _Iago._ And this may help to thicken other proofs[6058]
    That do demonstrate thinly.

    _Oth._                      I'll tear her all to pieces.         435

    _Iago._ Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;[6059]
    She may be honest yet. Tell me but this;
    Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief[6060]
    Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?[6061][6062]

    _Oth._ I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.               440

    _Iago._ I know not that: but such a handkerchief--[6060]
    I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day[5911][6061]
    See Cassio wipe his beard with.

    _Oth._                          If it be that,--[6063]

    _Iago._ If it be that, or any that was hers,[6064]
    It speaks against her with the other proofs.                     445

    _Oth._ O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
    One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
    Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;[6065]
    All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven:
    'Tis gone.[6066]                                                 450
    Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell![6067]
    Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne[6068]
    To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
    For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

    _Iago._                      Yet be content.[6069]

    _Oth._ O, blood, blood, blood![6070]                             455

    _Iago._ Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.[6071]

    _Oth._ Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic sea,[6072][6073]
    Whose icy current and compulsive course[6072][6074]
    Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on[6072][6075]
    To the Propontic and the Hellespont;[6072]                       460
    Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,[6072]
    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,[6072][6076]
    Till that a capable and wide revenge[6072]
    Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,[6072][6077]
    In the due reverence of a sacred vow           [_Kneels._[6078]  465
    I here engage my words.

    _Iago._                 Do not rise yet.            [_Kneels._[6079]
    Witness, you ever-burning lights above,[6080]
    You elements that clip us round about,[6081]
    Witness that here Iago doth give up
    The execution of his wit, hands, heart,[6082]                    470
    To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
    And to obey shall be in me remorse,[6083][6084]
    What bloody business ever.                 [_They rise._[6084][6085]

    _Oth._                     I greet thy love,
    Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
    And will upon the instant put thee to 't:                        475
    Within these three days let me hear thee say
    That Cassio's not alive.

    _Iago._ My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:[6086][6087]
    But let her live.[6086]

    _Oth._            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her![6088]
    Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,                         480
    To furnish me with some swift means of death
    For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.[6089]

    Iago. I am your own for ever.                             [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _Before the castle._

             _Enter_ DESDEMONA, EMILIA, _and_ Clown.[6090]

    _Des._ Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?[6091]

    _Clo._ I dare not say he lies any where.

    _Des._ Why, man?

    _Clo._ He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is[6092]
    stabbing.                                                          5

    _Des._ Go to: where lodges he?[6093]

    _Clo._ To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where[6094]
    I lie.[6094]

    _Des._ Can any thing be made of this?[6094]

    _Clo._ I know not where he lodges; and for me to devise           10
    a lodging, and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie[6095]
    in mine own throat.[6096]

    _Des._ Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?[6097]

    _Clo._ I will catechize the world for him; that is, make
    questions and by them answer.[6098]                               15

    _Des._ Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
    moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.[6099]

    _Clo._ To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and[6100]
    therefore I will attempt the doing it.                [_Exit._[6101]

    _Des._ Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?[6102]       20

    _Emil._ I know not, madam.

    _Des._ Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse[6103]
    Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
    Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
    As jealous creatures are, it were enough[6104]                    25
    To put him to ill thinking.[6104]

    _Emil._                     Is he not jealous?

    _Des._ Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
    Drew all such humours from him.

    _Emil._                         Look, where he comes.

    _Des._ I will not leave him now till Cassio[6105]
    Be call'd to him.[6105]

                         _Enter_ OTHELLO.[6106]

                      How is't with you, my lord?[6107]               30

    _Oth._ Well, my good lady. [_Aside_] O, hardness to dissemble![6108]
    How do you, Desdemona?

    _Des._                 Well, my good lord.[6109]

    _Oth._ Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.[6110]

    _Des._ It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.[6111]

    _Oth._ This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:                35
    Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires[6112]
    A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,[6113]
    Much castigation, exercise devout;[6114]
    For here's a young and sweating devil here,[6115]
    That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,                           40
    A frank one.[6116]

    _Des._       You may, indeed, say so;
    For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

    _Oth._ A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;[6117]
    But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

    _Des._ I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.[6118]      45

    _Oth._ What promise, chuck?

    _Des._ I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

    _Oth._ I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;[6119]
    Lend me thy handkerchief.[6120]

    _Des._ Here, my lord.                                             50

    _Oth._ That which I gave you.

    _Des._ I have it not about me.

    _Oth._ Not?[6121]

    _Des._ No, indeed, my lord.[6122]

    _Oth._ That's a fault. That handkerchief[6120][6123]              55
    Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
    She was a charmer, and could almost read
    The thoughts of people: she told her, while she kept it
    'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father[6124]
    Entirely to her love, but if she lost it[6125]                    60
    Or made a gift of it, my father's eye
    Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt[6126]
    After new fancies: she dying gave it me,
    And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,[6127]
    To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;                     65
    Make it a darling like your precious eye;
    To lose't or give't away were such perdition[6128]
    As nothing else could match.

    _Des._                       Is't possible?

    _Oth._ 'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
    A sibyl, that had number'd in the world[6129]                     70
    The sun to course two hundred compasses,[6130]
    In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;[6131]
    The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;[6132]
    And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful[6133]
    Conserved of maidens' hearts.

    _Des._                        Indeed! is't true?[6134]            75

    _Oth._ Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

    _Des._ Then would to God that I had never seen't![6135]

    _Oth._ Ha! wherefore?

    _Des._ Why do you speak so startingly and rash?[6136]

    _Oth._ Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?[6137]   80

    _Des._ Heaven bless us![6138]

    _Oth._ Say you?

    _Des._ It is not lost; but what an if it were?[6139]

    _Oth._ How![6140]

    _Des._ I say, it is not lost.                                     85

    _Oth._ Fetch't, let me see it.[6141]

    _Des._ Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.[6142]
    This is a trick to put me from my suit:
    Pray you, let Cassio be received again.[6143]

    _Oth._ Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.[6144][6145][6146]  90

    _Des._ Come, come;[6147]
    You'll never meet a more sufficient man.[6147][6148]

    _Oth._ The handkerchief![6145]

    _Des._                   I pray, talk me of Cassio.[6149]

    _Oth._ The handkerchief![6149]

    _Des._                   A man that all his time
    Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,[6150]                95
    Shared dangers with you,--[6151][6152]

    _Oth._ The handkerchief![6151]

    _Des._ In sooth, you are to blame.[6151][6153]

    _Oth._ Away!                                    [_Exit._[6151][6154]

    _Emil._ Is not this man jealous?[6151][6155]                     100

    _Des._ I ne'er saw this before.
    Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief:[6156]
    I am most unhappy in the loss of it.[6157]

    _Emil._ 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
    They are all but stomachs and we all but food;[6158]             105
    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full[6159]
    They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband.

                    _Enter_ CASSIO _and_ IAGO.[6160]

    _Iago._ There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:[6161]
    And, lo, the happiness! go and importune her.

    _Des._ How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?           110

    _Cas._ Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
    That by your virtuous means I may again[6162]
    Exist, and be a member of his love
    Whom I with all the office of my heart[6163]
    Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.[6164]                   115
    If my offence be of such mortal kind
    That nor my service past nor present sorrows[6165]
    Nor purposed merit in futurity
    Can ransom me into his love again,
    But to know so must be my benefit;                               120
    So shall I clothe me in a forced content
    And shut myself up in some other course[6166]
    To fortune's alms.[6167]

    _Des._             Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
    My advocation is not now in tune;
    My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him                    125
    Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
    So help me every spirit sanctified,
    As I have spoken for you all my best
    And stood within the blank of his displeasure[6168]
    For my free speech! You must awhile be patient:                  130
    What I can do I will; and more I will
    Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

    _Iago._ Is my lord angry?

    _Emil._                   He went hence but now,
    And certainly in strange unquietness.

    _Iago._ Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,                 135
    When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
    And, like the devil, from his very arm
    Puff'd his own brother; and can he be angry?[6169]
    Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
    There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.                       140

    _Des._ I prithee, do so.                         [_Exit Iago._[6170]
                                  Something sure of state,
    Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice[6171]
    Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,[6172]
    Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases[6173]
    Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,                      145
    Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;[6174][6175]
    For let our finger ache, and it indues[6174][6176]
    Our other healthful members even to that sense[6174][6177]
    Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,[6174]
    Nor of them look for such observancy[6178]                       150
    As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
    I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,[6179]
    Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
    But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
    And he's indicted falsely.[6180]                                 155

    _Emil._ Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,[6181][6182]
    And no conception nor no jealous toy[6181][6183][6184]
    Concerning you.[6181]

    _Des._ Alas the day, I never gave him cause!

    _Emil._ But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;[6184]         160
    They are not ever jealous for the cause,[6185]
    But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster[6186][6187]
    Begot upon itself, born on itself.[6188]

    _Des._ Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind![6189]

    _Emil._ Lady, amen.                                              165

    _Des._ I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:[6190]
    If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit,
    And seek to effect it to my uttermost.[6191]

    _Cas._ I humbly thank your ladyship.

                                         [_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia._

                         _Enter_ BIANCA.[6192]

    _Bian._ Save you, friend Cassio!

    _Cas._                       What make you from home?[6193]      170
    How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?[6194]
    I'faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.[6195]

    _Bian._ And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
    What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
    Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,[6196]         175
    More tedious than the dial eight score times?
    O weary reckoning![6197]

    _Cas._             Pardon me, Bianca:
    I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd;[6198]
    But I shall in a more continuate time[6199]
    Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,[6200]            180

                                 [_Giving her Desdemona's handkerchief._

    Take me this work out.

    _Bian._                O Cassio, whence came this?[6201]
    This is some token from a newer friend:[6202]
    To the felt absence now I feel a cause:[6202]
    Is't come to this? Well, well.

    _Cas._                         Go to, woman![6203]
    Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,[6204]              185
    From whence you have them. You are jealous now[6186]
    That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
    No, by my faith, Bianca.

    _Bian._                  Why, whose is it?[6205]

    _Cas._ I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.[6206]
    I like the work well: ere it be demanded--                       190
    As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:[6207]
    Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

    _Bian._ Leave you! wherefore?

    _Cas._ I do attend here on the general;
    And think it no addition, nor my wish,                           195
    To have him see me woman'd.

    _Bian._                     Why, I pray you?[6208]

    _Cas._ Not that I love you not.[6208]

    _Bian._                         But that you do not love me.[6209]
    I pray you, bring me on the way a little;
    And say if I shall see you soon at night.[6210]

    _Cas._ 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;               200
    For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

    _Bian._ 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.    [_Exeunt._[6211]

SCENE I. _Cyprus. Before the castle._

                   _Enter_ OTHELLO _and_ IAGO.[6212]

    _Iago._ Will you think so?

    _Oth._                     Think so, Iago![6213]

    _Iago._                                    What,[6214]
    To kiss in private?[6214]

    _Oth._               An unauthorized kiss.[6215]

    _Iago._ Or to be naked with her friend in bed[6216][6217]
    An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

    _Oth._ Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm![6217]                5
    It is hypocrisy against the devil:
    They that mean virtuously and yet do so,
    The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.[6218]

    _Iago._ So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:[6219]
    But if I give my wife a handkerchief--[6220][6221]                10

    _Oth._ What then?

    _Iago._ Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and being hers,[6222]
    She may, I think, bestow 't on any man.

    _Oth._ She is protectress of her honour too:[6223]
    May she give that?                                                15

    _Iago._ Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
    They have it very oft that have it not:
    But for the handkerchief--[6221]

    _Oth._ By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it:
    Thou said'st--O, it comes o'er my memory,                         20
    As doth the raven o'er the infected house,[6224]
    Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.[6225]

    _Iago._ Ay, what of that?

    _Oth._                    That's not so good now.

    _Iago._                                           What,[6226]
    If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?[6226][6227]
    Or heard him say--as knaves be such abroad,[6228]                 25
    Who having, by their own importunate suit,
    Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,[6229]
    Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose[6230]
    But they must blab--[6231]

    _Oth._               Hath he said any thing?

    _Iago._ He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,                30
    No more than he'll unswear.

    _Oth._                      What hath he said?

    _Iago._ Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.[6232]

    _Oth._ What? what?[6233]

    _Iago._ Lie--

    _Oth._        With her?

    _Iago._                 With her, on her; what you will.[6234]

    _Oth._ Lie with her! lie on her!--We say lie on her, when[6235]   35
    they belie her.--Lie with her! 'Zounds, that's fulsome![6235][6236]
    Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To confess, and[6237][6238][6239]
    be hanged for his labour; first, to be hanged, and then to[6238][6239]
    confess. I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in[6238][6239]
    such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not[6239][6240]  40
    words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears and lips.[6239][6241]
    Is't possible?--Confess?--Handkerchief?--O devil!

                                      [_Falls in a trance._[6239][6242]

    _Iago._ Work on,[6243]
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;[6243][6244]
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,[6243]                 45
    All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord![6243]
    My lord, I say! Othello![6243][6245]

                            _Enter_ CASSIO.

                             How now, Cassio!

    _Cas._ What's the matter?

    _Iago._ My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:[6246]
    This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.[6247]               50

    _Cas._ Rub him about the temples.

    _Iago._                           No, forbear;[6248]
    The lethargy must have his quiet course:[6249]
    If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by
    Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs:[6250]
    Do you withdraw yourself a little while,                          55
    He will recover straight: when he is gone,
    I would on great occasion speak with you.      [_Exit Cassio._[6251]
    How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?[6252]

    _Oth._ Dost thou mock me?

    _Iago._                   I mock you! no, by heaven.[6253]
    Would you would bear your fortune like a man![6254]               60

    _Oth._ A horned man's a monster and a beast.

    _Iago._ There's many a beast then in a populous city,
    And many a civil monster.

    _Oth._ Did he confess it?

    _Iago._                   Good sir, be a man;[6255]
    Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked[6256]                 65
    May draw with you: there's millions now alive[6257]
    That nightly lie in those unproper beds[6258]
    Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.[6259]
    O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,[6260]
    To lip a wanton in a secure couch,                                70
    And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;[6261][6262]
    And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.[6261][6263]

    _Oth._ O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.[6261]

    _Iago._                          Stand you awhile apart;[6261][6264]
    Confine yourself but in a patient list.
    Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--[6265]          75
    A passion most unsuiting such a man--[6266]
    Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
    And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;[6267]
    Bade him anon return and here speak with me;[6268]
    The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,[6269]              80
    And mark the fleers, the gibes and notable scorns,[6270]
    That dwell in every region of his face;
    For I will make him tell the tale anew,
    Where, how, how oft, how long ago and when
    He hath and is again to cope your wife:[6271]                     85
    I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
    Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,[6272]
    And nothing of a man.

    _Oth._                Dost thou hear, Iago?[6273]
    I will be found most cunning in my patience;[6274]
    But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.

    _Iago._                            That's not amiss;[6275]        90
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?

                                              [_Othello retires._[6276]

    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature[6277]
    That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague               95
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain[6278]
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.

                        _Re-enter_ CASSIO.[6279]

    As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;[6280]
    And his unbookish jealousy must construe[6281]                   100
    Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behaviour,[6282]
    Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?[6283]

    _Cas._ The worser that you give me the addition[6284]
    Whose want even kills me.

    _Iago._ Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on 't.              105
    Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's power,[6285]
    How quickly should you speed!

    _Cas._                        Alas, poor caitiff![6286]

    _Oth._ Look, how he laughs already![6287]

    _Iago._ I never knew a woman love man so.[6288]

    _Cas._ Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.[6289]  110

    _Oth._ Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.[6287][6290]

    _Iago._ Do you hear, Cassio?

    _Oth._                       Now he importunes him[6287][6291]
    To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.[6292]

    _Iago._ She gives it out that you shall marry her:
    Do you intend it?                                                115

    _Cas._ Ha, ha, ha!

    _Oth._ Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?[6287][6293]

    _Cas._ I marry her! what, a customer! I prithee, bear[6294][6295]
    some charity to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome.[6294]
    Ha, ha, ha![6294]                                                120

    _Oth._ So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.[6287][6296]

    _Iago._ Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.[6297]

    _Cas._ Prithee, say true.

    _Iago._ I am a very villain else.[6298]

    _Oth._ Have you scored me? Well.[6287][6299]                     125

    _Cas._ This is the monkey's own giving out: she is persuaded[6300]
    I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery,[6300]
    not out of my promise.[6300]

    _Oth._ Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.[6287][6301]

    _Cas._ She was here even now; she haunts me in every             130
    place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with[6302]
    certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble, and, by[6303][6304]
    this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--[6304][6305]

    _Oth._ Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture[6287][6306]
    imports it.                                                      135

    _Cas._ So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales[6307][6308]
    and pulls me: ha, ha, ha![6307]

    _Oth._ Now he tells how she plucked him to my[6287][6309]
    chamber. O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I[6309][6310]
    shall throw it to.[6309][6311]                                   140

    _Cas._ Well, I must leave her company.

    _Iago._ Before me! look, where she comes.[6312]

    _Cas._ Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.

                         _Enter_ BIANCA.[6313]

    What do you mean by this haunting of me?

    _Bian._ Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did            145
    you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even[6314]
    now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work?[6315]
    A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your
    chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some[6316]
    minx's token, and I must take out the work? There; give          150
    it your hobby-horse: wheresoever you had it, I'll take out[6317]
    no work on't.[6318]

    _Cas._ How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now![6319]

    _Oth._ By heaven, that should be my handkerchief![6287][6314]

    _Bian._ An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an[6320]     155
    you will not, come when you are next prepared for.          [_Exit._

    _Iago._ After her, after her.

    _Cas._ Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.[6321]

    _Iago._ Will you sup there?[6322]

    _Cas._ Faith, I intend so.[6323]                                 160

    _Iago._ Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very
    fain speak with you.

    _Cas._ Prithee, come; will you?

    _Iago._ Go to; say no more.                    [_Exit Cassio._[6324]

    _Oth._ [_Advancing_] How shall I murder him, Iago?[6325]         165

    _Iago._ Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

    _Oth._ O Iago![6326]

    _Iago._ And did you see the handkerchief?[6314]

    _Oth._ Was that mine?

    _Iago._ Yours, by this hand: and to see how he prizes the[6327]  170
    foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given[6327]
    it his whore.[6327]

    _Oth._ I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine[6327][6328]
    woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman![6328]

    _Iago._ Nay, you must forget that.[6329]                         175

    _Oth._ Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;[6330]
    for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to stone; I[6331]
    strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a[6332]
    sweeter creature: she might lie by an emperor's side, and
    command him tasks.                                               180

    _Iago._ Nay, that's not your way.

    _Oth._ Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate[6333]
    with her needle: an admirable musician: O, she will sing
    the savageness out of a bear: of so high and plenteous wit[6334]
    and invention:--[6335]                                           185

    _Iago._ She's the worse for all this.

    _Oth._ O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so[6336][6337][6338]
    gentle a condition![6337][6339]

    _Iago._ Ay, too gentle.

    _Oth._ Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago![6340]  190
    O Iago, the pity of it, Iago![6341]

    _Iago._ If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent[6342]
    to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.[6343]

    _Oth._ I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!

    _Iago._ O, 'tis foul in her.                                     195

    _Oth._ With mine officer!

    _Iago._ That's fouler.

    _Oth._ Get me some poison, Iago; this night. I'll not[6344]
    expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide[6345]
    my mind again: this night, Iago.                                 200

    _Iago._ Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed,[6346]
    even the bed she hath contaminated.[6347]

    _Oth._ Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.[6348]

    _Iago._ And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you[6349]
    shall hear more by midnight.[6349]                               205

    _Oth._ Excellent good.  [_A trumpet within._]  What
            trumpet is that same?[6350]

    _Iago._ Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico[6351][6352]
    Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.[6351]

          _Enter_ LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, _and_ Attendants.[6353]

    _Lod._ God save the worthy general!

    _Oth._                              With all my heart, sir.[6354]

    _Lod._ The duke and senators of Venice greet you.                210

                                            [_Gives him a letter._[6355]

    _Oth._ I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

                                   [_Opens the letter, and reads._[6356]

    _Des._ And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

    _Iago._ I am very glad to see you, signior;[6357][6358]
    Welcome to Cyprus.[6357]

    _Lod._ I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?[6359]            215

    _Iago._ Lives, sir.

    _Des._ Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
    An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

    _Oth._ Are you sure of that?

    _Des._ My lord?[6360]                                            220

    _Oth._ [_Reads_] 'This fail you not to do, as you will--'[6361]

    _Lod._ He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
    Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?[6362]

    _Des._ A most unhappy one: I would do much
    To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.[6363]              225

    _Oth._ Fire and brimstone!

    _Des._ My lord?[6360]

    _Oth._ Are you wise?

    _Des._ What, is he angry?

    _Lod._                    May be the letter moved him;
    For, as I think, they do command him home,                       230
    Deputing Cassio in his government.

    _Des._ By my troth, I am glad on 't.[6364]

    _Oth._                               Indeed!

    _Des._                                       My lord?[6360]

    _Oth._ I am glad to see you mad.

    _Des._                           Why, sweet Othello?[6365]

    _Oth._ Devil!                                 [_Striking her._[6366]

    _Des._ I have not deserved this.                                 235

    _Lod._ My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
    Though I should swear I saw 't: 'tis very much:
    Make her amends; she weeps.

    _Oth._                      O devil, devil!
    If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,[6367]
    Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.                     240
    Out of my sight!

    _Des._           I will not stay to offend you.      [_Going._[6368]

    _Lod._ Truly, an obedient lady:[6369]
    I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

    _Oth._ Mistress!

    _Des._ My lord?                                                  245

    _Oth._ What would you with her, sir?

    _Lod._                               Who, I, my lord?

    _Oth._ Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
    Sir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on,
    And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
    And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,[6370]                  250
    Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.[6371]
    Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--
    I am commanded home. Get you away;[6372]
    I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
    And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!                        255

                                                [_Exit Desdemona._[6373]

    Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, to-night,
    I do entreat that we may sup together:
    You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys![6374]

                                                                [_Exit._

    _Lod._ Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate[6375]
    Call all in all sufficient? This the nature[6376]                260
    Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue[6377]
    The shot of accident nor dart of chance[6378]
    Could neither graze nor pierce?[6379]

    _Iago._                         He is much changed.

    _Lod._ Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?[6380]

    _Iago._ He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure[6381][6382]  265
    What he might be: if what he might he is not,[6382][6383]
    I would to heaven he were!

    _Lod._                     What, strike his wife!

    _Iago._ Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
    That stroke would prove the worst!

    _Lod._                             Is it his use?[6384]
    Or did the letters work upon his blood,                          270
    And new create this fault?[6385]

    _Iago._                    Alas, alas!
    It is not honesty in me to speak
    What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,[6386]
    And his own courses will denote him so
    That I may save my speech: do but go after,[6387]                275
    And mark how he continues.

    _Lod._ I am sorry that I am deceived in him.        [_Exeunt._[6388]


SCENE II. _A room in the castle._[6389]

                     _Enter_ OTHELLO _and_ EMILIA.

    _Oth._ You have seen nothing, then?[6390][6391]

    _Emil._ Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.[6390]

    _Oth._ Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.[6390][6392]

    _Emil._ But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
    Each syllable that breath made up between them.[6393]              5

    _Oth._ What, did they never whisper?

    _Emil._                              Never, my lord.

    _Oth._ Nor send you out o' the way?[6394]

    _Emil._ Never.[6395]

    _Oth._ To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?[6396]

    _Emil._ Never, my lord.                                           10

    _Oth._ That's strange.

    _Emil._ I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
    Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
    Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
    If any wretch have put this in your head,[6397]                   15
    Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse![6398]
    For if she be not honest, chaste and true,
    There's no man happy; the purest of their wives[6399]
    Is foul as slander.

    _Oth._              Bid her come hither: go.   [_Exit Emilia._[6400]
    She says enough: yet she's a simple bawd                          20
    That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,[6401]
    A closet lock and key of villanous secrets:[6402]
    And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

                 _Enter_ DESDEMONA _with_ EMILIA.[6403]

    _Des._ My lord, what is your will?

    _Oth._                             Pray, chuck, come hither.[6404]

    _Des._ What is your pleasure?

    _Oth._                        Let me see your eyes;[6405]         25
    Look in my face.[6405]

    _Des._           What horrible fancy's this?

    _Oth._ [_To Emilia_] Some of your function, mistress;[6406]
    Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
    Cough, or cry hem, if any body come:
    Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch. [_Exit Emilia._[6407]  30

    _Des._ Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?[6408]
    I understand a fury in your words,
    But not the words.[6409][6410]

    _Oth._ Why, what art thou?[6410]

    _Des._ Your wife, my lord; your true and loyal wife.[6410]        35

    _Oth._ Come, swear it, damn thyself;[6410][6411]
    Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves[6411][6412]
    Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double-damn'd;[6411][6413]
    Swear thou art honest.[6411]

    _Des._                 Heaven doth truly know it.

    _Oth._ Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.[6414]      40

    _Des._ To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?[6415]

    _Oth._ O Desdemona! Away! away! away![6416]

    _Des._ Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?[6417]
    Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?[6418]
    If haply you my father do suspect[6419]                           45
    An instrument of this your calling back,
    Lay not your blame on me: if you have lost him,[6420][6421]
    Why, I have lost him too.[6421]

    _Oth._                    Had it pleased heaven[6422]
    To try me with affliction; had they rain'd[6423]
    All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,[6424]              50
    Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
    Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,[6425]
    I should have found in some place of my soul[6426]
    A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me[6427]
    A fixed figure for the time of scorn[6428]                        55
    To point his slow unmoving finger at![6428]
    Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
    But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
    Where either I must live or bear no life,
    The fountain from the which my current runs,[6429]                60
    Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
    Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads[6430]
    To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,[6431][6432]
    Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,[6431][6433]
    Ay, there, look grim as hell![6431][6434]                         65

    _Des._ I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.[6435]

    _Oth._ O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,[6436]
    That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,[6437][6438]
    Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet[6437][6439]
    That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been
              born![6437][6440]                                       70

    _Des._ Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

    _Oth._ Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
    Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed![6441]
    Committed! O thou public commoner![6442]
    I should make very forges of my cheeks,[6442][6443]               75
    That would to cinders burn up modesty,[6442]
    Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed![6442][6444]
    Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;
    The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,
    Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,[6445]                  80
    And will not hear it. What committed![6446]
    Impudent strumpet![6447]

    _Des._             By heaven, you do me wrong.

    _Oth._ Are not you a strumpet?

    _Des._                         No, as I am a Christian:
    If to preserve this vessel for my lord
    From any other foul unlawful touch[6448]                          85
    Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

    _Oth._ What, not a whore?

    _Des._                    No, as I shall be saved.

    _Oth._ Is't possible?

    _Des._ O, heaven forgive us!

    _Oth._                       I cry you mercy then:[6449]
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice                       90
    That married with Othello. [_Raising his voice_] You, mistress,[6450]
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!

                           _Re-enter_ EMILIA.

                               You, you, ay, you![6451]
    We have done our course; there's money for your pains:[6452]
    I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel.         [_Exit._  95

    _Emil._ Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
    How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

    _Des._ Faith, half asleep.

    _Emil._ Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?[6453]

    _Des._ With who?[6454]                                           100

    _Emil._ Why, with my lord, madam.[6455]

    _Des._ Who is thy lord?

    _Emil._                 He that is yours, sweet lady.[6456]

    _Des._ I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;[6457]
    I cannot weep, nor answer have I none[6458]
    But what should go by water. Prithee, to-night[6459]             105
    Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;[6460]
    And call thy husband hither.

    _Emil._                      Here's a change indeed!  [_Exit._[6461]

    _Des._ 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.[6462]
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?                         110

                  _Re-enter_ EMILIA _with_ IAGO.[6463]

    _Iago._ What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?[6464]

    _Des._ I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes[6465]
    Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
    He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,[6466]
    I am a child to chiding.

    _Iago._                  What's the matter, lady?[6467]          115

    _Emil._ Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
    Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
    As true hearts cannot bear.[6468]

    _Des._ Am I that name, Iago?

    _Iago._                      What name, fair lady?

    _Des._ Such as she says my lord did say I was.[6469]             120

    _Emil._ He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
    Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.[6470]

    _Iago._ Why did he so?

    _Des._ I do not know; I am sure I am none such.[6471]

    _Iago._ Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!                  125

    _Emil._ Hath she forsook so many noble matches,[6472]
    Her father and her country and her friends,[6473]
    To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

    _Des._ It is my wretched fortune.

    _Iago._                           Beshrew him for't![6474][6475]
    How comes this trick upon him?[6474]

    _Des._                         Nay, heaven doth know.            130

    _Emil._ I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
    Some busy and insinuating rogue,
    Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
    Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.[6476]

    _Iago._ Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.             135

    _Des._ If any such there be, heaven pardon him![6477]

    _Emil._ A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones![6478]
    Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?[6478]
    What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?[6478]
    The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,[6479]            140
    Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
    O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,[6480]
    And put in every honest hand a whip
    To lash the rascals naked through the world[6481]
    Even from the east to the west!

    _Iago._                         Speak within door.[6482]         145

    _Emil._ O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was[6483]
    That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
    And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

    _Iago._ You are a fool; go to.

    _Des._                         O good Iago,[6484]
    What shall I do to win my lord again?                            150
    Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,[6485]
    I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:[6486][6487]
    If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love[6487]
    Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,[6487][6488]
    Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,[6487]                155
    Delighted them in any other form,[6487][6489]
    Or that I do not yet, and ever did,[6487]
    And ever will, though he do shake me off[6487]
    To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,[6487]
    Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;[6487][6490]         160
    And his unkindness may defeat my life,[6487]
    But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore':[6487][6491]
    It doth abhor me now I speak the word;[6487][6492]
    To do the act that might the addition earn[6487]
    Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.[6487]              165

    _Iago._ I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
    The business of the state does him offence,
    And he does chide with you.[6493]

    _Des._ If 'twere no other,--

    _Iago._       'Tis but so, I warrant.      [_Trumpets within._[6494]
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper![6495]              170
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat:[6496]
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.

                                  [_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia._[6497]

                           _Enter_ RODERIGO.

    How now, Roderigo![6498]

    _Rod._ I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.[6499]

    _Iago._ What in the contrary?                                    175

    _Rod._ Every day thou daffest me with some device,[6500][6501]
    Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me[6502][6501]
    all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage[6501][6503][6504]
    of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it; nor am I yet[6501][6504]
    persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly[6501]  180
    suffered.[6501]

    _Iago._ Will you hear me, Roderigo?

    _Rod._ Faith, I have heard too much; for your words[6505][6506]
    and performances are no kin together.[6506][6507]

    _Iago._ You charge me most unjustly.                             185

    _Rod._ With nought but truth. I have wasted myself[6508]
    out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to[6509]
    deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist:[6510]
    you have told me she hath received them and returned[6511]
    me expectations and comforts of sudden respect[6512]             190
    and acquaintance; but I find none.[6513]

    _Iago._ Well; go to; very well.[6514]

    _Rod._ Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis[6515]
    not very well: by this hand, I say 'tis very scurvy, and[6516]
    begin to find myself fopped in it.[6517]                         195

    _Iago._ Very well.

    _Rod._ I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself[6518]
    known to Desdemona: if she will return me my jewels, I
    will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation;
    if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.[6519]   200

    _Iago._ You have said now.[6520]

    _Rod._ Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment[6521][6522]
    of doing.[6522]

    _Iago._ Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even
    from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than[6523]   205
    ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast taken
    against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, I[6524]
    have dealt most directly in thy affair.[6525]

    _Rod._ It hath not appeared.

    _Iago._ I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your            210
    suspicion is not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo,
    if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason[6526]
    to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage
    and valour, this night show it: if thou the next night following
    enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world[6527]               215
    with treachery and devise engines for my life.

    _Rod._ Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?[6528]

    _Iago._ Sir, there is especial commission come from[6529][6530]
    Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place.[6530]

    _Rod._ Is that true? why then Othello and Desdemona[6530]        220
    return again to Venice.[6530]

    _Iago._ O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away[6530][6531]
    with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered[6530]
    here by some accident: wherein none can be so determinate[6530][6532]
    as the removing of Cassio.[6530]                                 225

    _Rod._ How do you mean, removing of him?[6530][6533]

    _Iago._ Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's[6530][6534]
    place; knocking out his brains.[6530]

    _Rod._ And that you would have me to do?[6535]

    _Iago._ Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.[6536]  230
    He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him:[6537]
    he knows not yet of his honourable fortune. If you will
    watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between
    twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure:
    I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between  235
    us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
    me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you
    shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high[6538]
    supper-time, and the night grows to waste: about it.[6539]

    _Rod._ I will hear further reason for this.                      240

    _Iago._ And you shall be satisfied.                 [_Exeunt._[6540]


SCENE III. _Another room in the castle._

 _Enter_ OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA, _and_ Attendants.[6541]

    _Lod._ I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.[6542]

    _Oth._ O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.[6543]

    _Lod._ Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

    _Des._ Your honour is most welcome.

    _Oth._                              Will you walk, sir?[6544]
    O,--Desdemona,--[6544][6545]                                       5

    _Des._ My lord?[6546]

    _Oth._ Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned[6547][6548]
    forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.[6548][6549]

    _Des._ I will, my lord.

                     [_Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants._[6550]

    _Emil._ How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.            10

    _Des._ He says he will return incontinent:
    He hath commanded me to go to bed,[6551]
    And bade me to dismiss you.

    _Emil._                     Dismiss me![6552]

    _Des._ It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
    Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:                            15
    We must not now displease him.

    _Emil._ I would you had never seen him![6553]

    _Des._ So would not I: my love doth so approve him,
    That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,--[6554]
    Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.[6555]          20

    _Emil._ I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.[6556]

    _Des._ All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds![6557]
    If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me[6558]
    In one of those same sheets.[6559]

    _Emil._                      Come, come, you talk.

    _Des._ My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:[6560]                 25
    She was in love; and he she loved proved mad[6561][6562]
    And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'[6561][6563][6564]
    An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
    And she died singing it: that song to-night
    Will not go from my mind; I have much to do[6565][6566][6567]     30
    But to go hang my head all at one side[6566][6568][6569]
    And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.[6566][6568][6570]

    _Emil._ Shall I go fetch your night-gown?[6566][6571]

    _Des._                                    No, unpin me here.[6566]
    This Lodovico is a proper man.[6566]

    _Emil._ A very handsome man.[6566]                                35

    _Des._ He speaks well.[6566][6572]

    _Emil._ I know a lady in Venice would have walked[6566]
    barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.[6566][6573]

    _Des._ [_Singing_] The poor soul sat sighing by a
                        sycamore tree,[6566][6574]
          Sing all a green willow;[6566]                              40
      Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,[6566]
          Sing willow, willow, willow:[6566]
      The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;[6566]
          Sing willow, willow, willow;[6566][6575]
      Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;--[6566][6576]  45
    Lay by these:--[6566][6577][6578]
        [_Singing_] Sing willow, willow, willow;[6566][6577]
    Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--[6566][6577]
        [_Singing_] Sing all a green willow must be my garland.[6566]
            Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,--[6566]        50
    Nay, that's not next. Hark! who is't that knocks?[6566][6579]

    _Emil._ It's the wind.[6580]

    _Des._ [_Singing_] I call'd my love false love; but what
                        said he then?[6581][6582]
            Sing willow, willow, willow:[6575][6581]
    If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men.[6581][6583]      55
    So get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch;[6584][6585]
    Doth that bode weeping?[6585][6586]

    _Emil._                 'Tis neither here nor there.

    _Des._ I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men![6587]
    Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--[6587]
    That there be women do abuse their husbands[6587]                 60
    In such gross kind?[6587][6588]

    _Emil._             There be some such, no question.

    _Des._ Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?[6589]

    _Emil._ Why, would not you?

    _Des._                      No, by this heavenly light!

    _Emil._ Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might[6590][6591]
    do't as well i' the dark.[6590][6592]                             65

    _Des._ Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?[6593]

    _Emil._ The world's a huge thing: it is a great price[6594][6595]
    For a small vice.[6594]

    _Des._            In troth, I think thou wouldst not.[6596]

    _Emil._ In troth, I think I should; and undo 't when I[6597]
    had done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a[6598]          70
    joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats,[6599]
    nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the whole[6600]
    world,--why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to[6601]
    make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for 't.[6602]

    _Des._ Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong[6603][6604]         75
    For the whole world.[6603]

    _Emil._ Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world;
    and having the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in your
    own world, and you might quickly make it right.

    _Des._ I do not think there is any such woman.                    80

    _Emil._ Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as
    would store the world they played for.
    But I do think it is their husbands' faults[6605]
    If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties[6605]
    And pour our treasures into foreign laps,[6605]                   85
    Or else break out in peevish jealousies,[6605]
    Throwing restraint upon us, or say they strike us,[6605][6606]
    Or scant our former having in despite,[6605]
    Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,[6605]
    Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know[6605]                 90
    Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell[6605]
    And have their palates both for sweet and sour,[6605]
    As husbands have. What is it that they do[6605]
    When they change us for others? Is it sport?[6605]
    I think it is: and doth affection breed it?[6605]                 95
    I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?[6605]
    It is so too: and have not we affections,[6605]
    Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?[6605][6607]
    Then let them use us well: else let them know,[6605][6608]
    The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.[6605][6609]           100

    _Des._ Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,[6610]
    Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!                [_Exeunt._

    _Rod._ O, villain that I am!

    _Oth._                       It is even so.[6633]

    _Cas._ O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!                             30

    _Oth._ 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come![6634]
    Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;[6635]    35
    Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.    [_Exit._

                 _Enter_ LODOVICO _and_ GRATIANO.[6636]

    _Cas._ What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder![6637]

    _Gra._ 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.[6638]

    _Cas._ O, help!

    _Lod._ Hark!                                                      40

    _Rod._ O wretched villain!

    _Lod._ Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:[6639]
    These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
    To come in to the cry without more help.[6640]

    _Rod._ Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.[6641]            45

    _Lod._ Hark![6642]

                 _Re-enter_ IAGO, _with a light_.[6643]

    _Gra._ Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.[6644]

    _Iago._ Who's there? whose noise is this that cries on murder?[6645]

    _Lod._ We do not know.

    _Iago._                Did not you hear a cry?[6646]

    _Cas._ Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me![6647]

    _Iago._                                        What's the matter?  50

    _Gra._ This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

    _Lod._ The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

    _Iago._ What are you here that cry so grievously?

    _Cas._ Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains![6648]
    Give me some help.                                                55

    _Iago._ O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?[6649]

    _Cas._ I think that one of them is hereabout,[6650]
    And cannot make away.

    _Iago._               O treacherous villains!
    What are you there? come in and give some help.

                                     [_To Lodovico and Gratiano._[6651]

    _Rod._ O, help me here![6652]                                     60

    _Cas._ That's one of them.

    _Iago._                    O murderous slave! O villain!

                                               [_Stabs Roderigo._[6653]

    _Rod._ O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog![6654]

    _Iago._ Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?[6655]
    How silent is this town! Ho! murder! murder!
    What may you be? are you of good or evil?                         65

    _Lod._ As you shall prove us, praise us.

    _Iago._ Signior Lodovico?[6656]

    _Lod._ He, sir.

    _Iago._ I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

    _Gra._ Cassio![6657]                                              70

    _Iago._ How is't, brother?[6658]

    _Cas._ My leg is cut in two.

    _Iago._                      Marry, heaven forbid!
    Light, gentlemen: I'll bind it with my shirt.

                            _Enter_ BIANCA.

    _Bian._ What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?[6659]

    _Iago._ Who is't that cried![6660]                                75

    _Bian._ O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,[6661]
    Cassio, Cassio![6661]

    _Iago._ O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
    Who they should be that have thus mangled you?[6662]

    _Cas._ No.                                                        80

    _Gra._ I am sorry to find you thus: I have been to seek you.[6663]

    _Iago._ Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,[6664]
    To bear him easily hence![6664]

    _Bian._ Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

    _Iago._ Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash                    85
    To be a party in this injury.[6665][6666]
    Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;[6665][6667]
    Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?[6665][6668]
    Alas, my friend and my dear countryman
    Roderigo? no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.[6669]               90

    _Gra._ What, of Venice?[6670]

    _Iago._ Even he, sir: did you know him?

    _Gra._                                  Know him! ay.[6671]

    _Iago._ Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;[6672]
    These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
    That so neglected you.

    _Gra._                 I am glad to see you.                      95

    _Iago._ How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!

    _Gra._ Roderigo![6673]

    _Iago._ He, he, 'tis he. [_A chair brought in._] O, that's
            well said; the chair:[6674]
    Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
    I'll fetch the general's surgeon. [_To Bianca_] For you,
               mistress,[6675]                                       100
    Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio,[6676]
    Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?[6677]

    _Cas._ None in the world; nor do I know the man.[6678]

    _Iago._ [_To Bian._] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
                o' the air.  [_Cassio and Roderigo are borne off._[6679]
    Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?[6680]         105
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?[6681]
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.[6682]
    Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
    Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,[6683]
    Though tongues were out of use.[6683]                            110

                         _Enter_ EMILIA.[6684]

    _Emil._ 'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?[6685]

    _Iago._ Cassio hath here been set on in the dark[6686]
    By Roderigo, and fellows that are 'scaped:
    He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.[6687]

    _Emil._ Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!                 115

    _Iago._ This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,[6688]
    Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
    What, do you shake at that?

    _Bian._ He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.[6689]

    _Iago._ O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.                  120

    _Emil._ Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet![6690]

    _Bian._ I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
    As you that thus abuse me.

    _Emil._                    As I! foh! fie upon thee![6691]

    _Iago._ Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.[6692]
    Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.[6693]              125
    Emilia, run you to the citadel,[6694]
    And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd![6695]
    Will you go on? I pray. [_Aside_] This is the night[6696]
    That either makes me or fordoes me quite.           [_Exeunt._[6697]


SCENE II. _A bedchamber in the castle_: DESDEMONA _in bed asleep; a
light burning_.[6698]

                            _Enter_ OTHELLO.

    _Oth._ It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul:
    Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!
    It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,[6699]
    Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
    And smooth as monumental alabaster.[6700]                          5
    Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.[6701]
    Put out the light, and then put out the light:[6702]
    If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
    I can again thy former light restore,
    Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,[6703]             10
    Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,[6704]
    I know not where is that Promethean heat[6705]
    That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,[6706]
    I cannot give it vital growth again,
    It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.                  15

                                                   [_Kissing her._[6707]

    Ah, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade[6708]
    Justice to break her sword! One more, one more:[6709]
    Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
    And love thee after: one more, and this the last:[6710]
    So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,                         20
    But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;[6711]
    It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.[6712]

    _Des._ Who's there? Othello?

    _Oth._                       Ay, Desdemona.[6713]

    _Des._ Will you come to bed, my lord?

    _Oth._ Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?[6714]

    _Des_.                                           Ay, my lord.     25

    _Oth._ If you bethink yourself of any crime
    Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
    Solicit for it straight.

    _Des._ Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?[6715]

    _Oth._ Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:                 30
    I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
    No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.[6716]

    _Des._ Talk you of killing?[6717]

    _Oth._ Ay, I do.[6717]

    _Des._ Then heaven have mercy on me![6717]                        35

    _Oth._ Amen, with all my heart![6717]

    _Des._ If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.[6718]

    _Oth._ Hum!

    _Des._ And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then[6719]
    When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,[6720]       40
    Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.[6721]

    _Oth._ Think on thy sins.

    _Des._                    They are loves I bear to you.[6722]

    _Oth._ Ay, and for that thou diest.[6723]

    _Des._ That death's unnatural that kills for loving.[6724]
    Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?[6725]                      45
    Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
    These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,[6726]
    They do not point on me.

    _Oth._                   Peace, and be still!

    _Des._ I will so. What's the matter?[6727]

    _Oth._ That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee[6728][6729]  50
    Thou gavest to Cassio.[6730]

    _Des._                 No, by my life and soul![6728]
    Send for the man, and ask him.[6728]

    _Oth._                         Sweet soul, take heed,[6731]
    Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy death-bed.[6731][6732]

    _Des._ Ay, but not yet to die.

    _Oth._                         Yes, presently:[6733]
    Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;                         55
    For to deny each article with oath
    Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception[6734]
    That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

    _Des._ Then Lord have mercy on me![6735]

    _Oth._                             I say, amen.

    _Des._  And have you mercy too! I never did[6736]                 60
    Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio[6736]
    But with such general warranty of heaven
    As I might love: I never gave him token.

    _Oth._ By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.[6729][6737]
    O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,[6738]                 65
    And makest me call what I intend to do[6739]
    A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
    I saw the handkerchief.[6729]

    _Des._                  He found it then;
    I never gave it him: send for him hither;
    Let him confess a truth.

    _Oth._                   He hath confess'd.[6740]                 70

    _Des._  What, my lord?

    _Oth._ That he hath used thee.[6741]

    _Des._                         How? unlawfully?

    _Oth._ Ay.

    _Des._ He will not say so.

    _Oth._                     No, his mouth is stopp'd;
    Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.[6742]                         75

    _Des._ O, my fear interprets! what, is he dead?[6743]

    _Oth._ Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge[6744]
    Had stomach for them all.[6744][6745]

    _Des._ Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone![6746]

    _Oth._ Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?[6747]      80

    _Des._ O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

    _Oth._ Down, strumpet!

    _Des._ Kill me to-morrow; let me live to-night!

    _Oth._ Nay, if you strive,--[6748]

    _Des._ But half an hour!

    _Oth._                Being done, there is no pause.[6749][6750]  85

    _Des._ But while I say one prayer![6750]

    _Oth._                      It is too late. [_He stifles her._[6751]

    _Emil._ [_Within_] My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord![6752]

    _Oth._ What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?[6753]
    I that am cruel am yet merciful;
    I would not have thee linger in thy pain:[6754]                   90
    So, so.[6754][6755]

    _Emil._ [_Within_] What, ho! my lord, my lord!

    _Oth._                                                   Who's there?

    _Emil._ [_Within_] O, good my lord, I would speak a
              word with you![6756][6757]

    _Oth._ Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
    'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.                   95
    The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?[6758][6759]
    Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were 't good?[6759]
    I think she stirs again. No. What's best to do?[6760]
    If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
    My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.[6761]               100
    O, insupportable! O heavy hour!
    Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
    Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
    Should yawn at alteration.[6762]

    _Emil._                   [_Within_] I do beseech you[6756][6763][6764]
    That I may speak with you, O, good my lord![6763][6765]          105

    _Oth._ I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia.[6766]
    Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
    Where art thou?                           [_Unlocks the door._[6767]

                         _Enter_ EMILIA.[6768]

                            What's the matter with thee now?

    _Emil._ O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done![6769]

    _Oth._ What, now?[6770]                                          110

    _Emil._ But now, my lord.

    _Oth._ It is the very error of the moon;
    She comes more nearer earth than she was wont[6771]
    And makes men mad.

    _Emil._ Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian[6772][6773]  115
    Call'd Roderigo.[6772]

    _Oth._           Roderigo kill'd![6774]
    And Cassio kill'd![6774]

    _Emil._            No, Cassio is not kill'd.

    _Oth._ Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
    And sweet revenge grows harsh.

    _Des._ O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

    _Emil._                              Alas, what cry is that?[6775]  120

    _Oth._ That! what?

    _Emil._ Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.[6776]
    Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
    Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

    _Des._ A guiltless death I die.                                  125

    _Emil._ O, who hath done this deed?[6777]

    _Des._ Nobody; I myself. Farewell:
    Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!              [_Dies._[6778]

    _Oth._ Why, how should she be murder'd?[6779]

    _Emil._                                 Alas, who knows?

    _Oth._ You heard her say herself, it was not I.[6780]            130

    _Emil._ She said so: I must needs report the truth.[6781]

    _Oth._ She's like a liar gone to burning hell:[6782]
    'Twas I that kill'd her.

    _Emil._                  O, the more angel she,[6783]
    And you the blacker devil![6783]

    _Oth._ She turn'd to folly and she was a whore.                  135

    _Emil._ Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil.

    _Oth._ She was false as water.

    _Emil._                    Thou art rash as fire, to say[6784][6785]
    That she was false: O, she was heavenly true![6784]

    _Oth._ Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.[6786]
    O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,                      140
    But that I did proceed upon just grounds
    To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.[6787]

    _Emil._ My husband![6788]

    _Oth._ Thy husband.

    _Emil._ That she was false to wedlock?                           145

    _Oth._ Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,[6789]
    If heaven would make me such another world
    Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,
    I'ld not have sold her for it.

    _Emil._ My husband!

    _Oth._              Ay, 'twas he that told me first:[6790]       150
    An honest man he is, and hates the slime
    That sticks on filthy deeds.[6791]

    _Emil._                      My husband!

    _Oth._ What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.[6792]

    _Emil._ O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love![6793][6794]
    My husband say that she was false![6793][6795]

    _Oth._                             He, woman;[6793][6796]        155
    I say thy husband: dost understand the word?[6793][6796]
    My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.[6793]

    _Emil._ If he say so, may his pernicious soul[6797]
    Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:[6798]
    She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.                     160

    _Oth._ Ha![6799]

    _Emil._ Do thy worst:
    This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
    Than thou wast worthy her.

    _Oth._                     Peace, you were best.[6800]

    _Emil._ Thou hast not half that power to do me harm[6801]        165
    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt![6802]
    As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--[6803]
    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,[6804]
    Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help![6805]
    The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!                170

          _Enter_ MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, _and others_.[6806]

    _Mon._ What is the matter? How now, general![6807]

    _Emil._ O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
    That men must lay their murders on your neck.[6808]

    _Gra._ What is the matter?[6809]

    _Emil._ Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:[6810]        175
    He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
    I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain.[6811]
    Speak, for my heart is full.

    _Iago._ I told him what I thought, and told no more[6812]
    Than what he found himself was apt and true.[6813]               180

    _Emil._ But did you ever tell him she was false?[6814]

    _Iago._ I did.

    _Emil._ You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
    Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!
    She false with Cassio! Did you say with Cassio?[6815][6816]      185

    _Iago._ With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.[6815][6817]

    _Emil._ I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to
              speak:[6815][6817][6818]
    My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--[6819][6820]

    _All._ O heavens forfend![6819][6821]

    _Emil._ And your reports have set the murder on.[6819][6821][6822]  190

    _Oth._ Nay, stare not, masters: it is true indeed.[6819][6821][6823]

    _Gra._'Tis a strange truth.[6819][6821]

    _Mon._ O monstrous act![6819][6821]

    _Emil._                 Villany, villany, villany![6819][6821]
    I think upon't: I think: I smell't: O villany![6819][6821][6824]
    I thought so then: I'll kill myself for grief:[6819][6821]       195
    O villany, villany![6819][6821]

    _Iago._ What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.[6825]

    _Emil._ Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
    'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
    Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.[6826]                     200

    _Oth._ O! O! O!                         [_Falling on the bed._[6827]

    _Emil._         Nay, lay thee down and roar;
    For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
    That e'er did lift up eye.

    _Oth._                     [_Rising_] O, she was foul![6828]
    I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
    Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd:              205
    I know this act shows horrible and grim.[6829]

    _Gra._ Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:[6830]
    Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
    Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,[6831]
    This sight would make him do a desperate turn,                   210
    Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
    And fall to reprobation.[6832]

    _Oth._ 'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
    That she with Cassio hath the act of shame[6833]
    A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:                 215
    And she did gratify his amorous works
    With that recognizance and pledge of love[6834]
    Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
    It was a handkerchief, an antique token[6835][6836]
    My father gave my mother.                                        220

    _Emil._ O heaven! O heavenly powers![6837]

    _Iago._'Zounds! hold your peace.

    _Emil._                 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace![6838][6839]
    No, I will speak as liberal as the north:[6839][6840]
    Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,[6841]
    All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.                  225

    _Iago._ Be wise, and get you home.[6842]

    _Emil._                            I will not.

                                          [_Iago offers to stab Emilia._

    _Gra._                                         Fie![6843]
    Your sword upon a woman![6843][6844]

    _Emil._ O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou
            speak'st of[6835][6845]
    I found by fortune and did give my husband;
    For often with a solemn earnestness,                             230
    More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
    He begg'd of me to steal it.[6846]

    _Iago._                      Villanous whore!

    _Emil._ She give it Cassio! no, alas, I found it,
    And I did give't my husband.[6847]

    _Iago._                      Filth, thou liest!

    _Emil._ By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.                235
    O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
    Do with so good a wife?

    _Oth._                  Are there no stones in heaven[6848]
    But what serve for the thunder? Precious villain!

                   [_He runs at Iago: Iago, from behind, stabs Emilia,
                                                       and exit._[6849]

    _Gra._ The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.[6850]

    _Emil._ Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.[6851]            240

    _Gra._ He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

    _Mon._ 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,[6852]
    Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:[6853]
    Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,[6854]
    But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,               245
    For 'tis a damned slave.

                            [_Exeunt all but Othello and Emilia._[6855]

    _Oth._                   I am not valiant neither,
    But every puny whipster gets my sword.
    But why should honour outlive honesty?
    Let it go all.

    _Emil._        What did thy song bode, lady?[6856]
    Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,[6856]            250
    And die in music. [_Singing_] Willow, willow, willow.[6856][6857]
    Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
    So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
    So speaking as I think, I die, I die.                 [_Dies._[6858]

    _Oth._ I have another weapon in this chamber;                    255
    It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper.--[6859]
    O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.

    _Gra._[_Within_] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:[6860]
    Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.

    _Oth._ Look in upon me then, and speak with me,[6861]            260
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

                       _Re-enter_ GRATIANO.[6862]

    _Gra._ What is the matter?

    _Oth._                     Behold, I have a weapon;[6863]
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day[6864]
    That with this little arm and this good sword                    265
    I have made my way through more impediments[6865]
    Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast![6866]
    Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;[6867]
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt[6867]                  270
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.[6867][6868]
    Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear:[6867]
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,[6867]
    And he retires. Where should Othello go?[6867]
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench![6867][6869]    275
    Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,[6870]
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
    Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave![6871][6872]
    Whip me, ye devils,[6871][6873]                                  280
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur![6874]
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire![6875]
    O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead![6876]
    Oh! Oh! Oh![6876]                                                285

  _Enter_ LODOVICO, MONTANO, CASSIO _carried in a chair, and_ Officers
                     _with_ IAGO, _prisoner_.[6877]

    _Lod._ Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?[6878]

    _Oth._ That's he that was Othello: here I am.[6879]

    _Lod._ Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.[6880]

    _Oth._ I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
    If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee. [_Wounds Iago._[6881]  290

    _Lod._ Wrench his sword from him.

    _Iago._                           I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.[6882]

    _Oth._ I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
    For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

    _Lod._ O thou Othello, that wert once so good,[6883]
    Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave,[6884]                  295
    What shall be said to thee?[6885]

    _Oth._                      Why, any thing:
    An honourable murderer, if you will;
    For nought did I in hate, but all in honour.[6886]

    _Lod._ This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
    Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?                        300

    _Oth._ Ay.

    _Cas._ Dear general, I never gave you cause.[6887]

    _Oth._ I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.[6888]
    Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil[6889]
    Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?[6890]                305

    _Iago._ Demand me nothing; what you know, you know:
    From this time forth I never will speak word.

    _Lod._ What, not to pray?

    _Gra._                    Torments will ope your lips.

    _Oth._ Well, thou dost best.

    _Lod._ Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,[6891]       310
    Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter[6892]
    Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
    And here another: the one of them imports[6893]
    The death of Cassio to be undertook[6894]
    By Roderigo.[6894]

    _Oth._ O villain![6895]                                          315

    _Cas._            Most heathenish and most gross!

    _Lod._ Now here's another discontented paper,
    Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
    Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
    But that, belike, Iago in the interim[6896]                      320
    Came in and satisfied him.

    _Oth._                     O the pernicious caitiff![6897]
    How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief[6898]
    That was my wife's?[6899]

    _Cas._              I found it in my chamber:
    And he himself confess'd but even now[6900]
    That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose                   325
    Which wrought to his desire.

    _Oth._                       O fool! fool! fool!

    _Cas._ There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
    How he upbraids Iago, that he made him[6901]
    Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
    That I was cast: and even but now he spake[6902]                 330
    After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
    Iago set him on.

    _Lod._ You must forsake this room, and go with us:
    Your power and your command is taken off,
    And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,[6903]                335
    If there be any cunning cruelty
    That can torment him much and hold him long,
    It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
    Till that the nature of your fault be known
    To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.[6904]                   340

    _Oth._ Soft you; a word or two before you go.[6905]
    I have done the state some service, and they know't.[6906]
    No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
    When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
    Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,[6907]                    345
    Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak[6908]
    Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
    Of one not easily jealous but, being wrought,[6909]
    Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,[6910]
    Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away[6911]                   350
    Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,[6912]
    Albeit unused to the melting mood,
    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees[6913]
    Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;[6914]
    And say besides, that in Aleppo once,                            355
    Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk[6915]
    Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,[6916]
    I took by the throat the circumcised dog[6917]
    And smote him, thus.                         [_Stabs himself._[6918]

    _Lod._ O bloody period!

    _Gra._                  All that's spoke is marr'd.[6919]        360

    _Oth._ I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this,[6920]
    Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

                                   [_Falls on the bed, and dies._[6921]

    _Cas._ This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
    For he was great of heart.

    _Lod._                     [_To Iago_] O Spartan dog,[6922]
    More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!                      365
    Look on the tragic loading of this bed;[6923]
    This is thy work: the object poisons sight;[6924]
    Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
    And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,[6925]
    For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,[6926]            370
    Remains the censure of this hellish villain,[6927]
    The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!
    Myself will straight aboard, and to the state
    This heavy act with heavy heart relate.             [_Exeunt._[6928]

NOTES.


NOTE I.

I. 1. 16. The punctuation in the text was first given by Steevens
(1773). Most editors following Capell, including Steevens in his later
editions, have supposed 'for, certes' to be part of Othello's speech.
Mr Collier, omitting the comma, gives 'For certes' as the commencement
of Othello's words. There is no comma in either Quartos or Folios, and
the printing leaves it uncertain where the quotation is meant to begin.


NOTE II.

I. 1. 20, 21. Theobald marks 'Certes ... officer,' and 'the
Florentine's ... wife' with inverted commas, to indicate that they
are Iago's report of Othello's speeches, and supposes Iago to be the
'fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife.' 'The Poet means,' he adds,
'_Iago_ had so beautiful a Wife, that she was his _Heaven on Earth_;
that he _idoliz'd_ her; and forgot to think of Happiness in an
After-state, as placing all his Views of Bliss in the single Enjoyment
of her. In this sense, _Beauty_, when it can so seduce and ingross
a Man's Thoughts, may be said _almost to damn_ him.' Warburton's
explanation agrees substantially with that of Theobald.


NOTE III.

I. 3. 370-374. The reading in the text is that of the second and third
Quartos. The first Quarto has:

    '_Iag._ Go to, farewell:--doe you heare _Roderigo_?

    _Rod._ what say you?

    _Iag._ No more of drowning, doe you heare?

    _Rod._ I am chang'd.       _Exit Roderigo._

    _Iag._ Goe to, farewell, put money enough in your purse:
    Thus doe I euer make my foole my purse:'

The first Folio, followed substantially by the rest, reads:

    '_Iago._ Go too, farewell. Do you heare, _Rodorigo_?

    _Rod._ Ile sell all my Land.          _Exit._

    _Iago._ Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse:'

Rowe and Pope follow the Folios.

Theobald has:

    '_Iago._ Go to, farewel. Do you hear, _Rodorigo_?

    _Rod._ What say you?

    _Iago._ No more of drowning, do you hear.

    _Rod._ I am chang'd; I'll go sell all my land.              [_Exit._

                             _Manet_ Iago.

    _Iago._ Go to, farewel, put mony enough in your purse--
    Thus, &c.'

Hanmer:

    '_Iago._ Go to, farewel. Do you hear, _Rodorigo_?
    No more of drowning.

    _Rod._ I'll sell all my land.                               [_Exit._

                               SCENE XI.

                             _Manet_ Iago.

    _Iago._ Thus,' &c.

Warburton follows Theobald, and so does Johnson, except that he
transfers 'Exit Rodorigo' to follow the first line of Iago's speech,
and makes Scene XI. begin with the next. Capell reduces the whole to
the following:

    '_Iag._ Go to, farewel.

    _Rod._ I'll sell all my land.                               [_Exit._

    _Iag._ Thus,' &c.


NOTE IV.

III. 3. 116. In the Devonshire copy of the first Quarto there is a
marginal stage direction in a 17th century hand opposite this line,
'With admiring action.' Some other stage directions and readings quoted
in our foot-notes as 'Anon. MS.' are from the same source. More than
one hand seems to have been employed, and there are other notes of a
much later date in pencil.


NOTE V.

III. 3. 153. Johnson attributes the reading 'improbably' to what he
calls 'the old Quarto.' We have not found it in any copies.


NOTE VI.

III. 3. 172. In the Devonshire copy of the first Quarto, which formerly
belonged to Steevens, and which was the original of his reprint, the
word 'loues' is partially obliterated by being changed with a pen to
'hates', but being still obscure 'hates', is written in the margin
opposite in the same hand as the stage direction mentioned in note IV.
Capell's copy has distinctly 'loues', and that this was originally
the reading of the Devonshire copy is evident from the traces of the
letters which still remain. Two lines above, opposite 'make,' a late
hand has written in pencil 'muck' (which is Becket's conjecture) in the
Devonshire copy. We have no means of ascertaining whether this note was
written before or after the publication of Becket's work.


NOTE VII.

III. 3. 405. Capell prints the words: 'What then? how then? Where's
satisfaction?' in italics, to indicate that Iago is repeating what
Othello had said.


NOTE VIII.

IV. 1. 207, 208. The first Folio reads as follows:

    '_Iago._ I warrant something from Venice,
    'Tis _Lodouico_ this, comes from the Duke.
    See, your wife's with him.'

The other Folios have substantially the same reading, except that the
second has '_Lodovico_, this, comes, &c.,' and the third and fourth
'_Lodovico_, this comes, &c.'

Hanmer has:

    '_Iago._ I warrant you 'tis something come from Venice.
    Oh! it is _Lodovico_ from the Duke:
    And see, your wife is with him.'

We have given in our text the reading of the Quartos with Theobald's
punctuation.


NOTE IX.

IV. 2. 55, 56. The first Quarto has:

    'A fixed figure, for the time of scorne,
    To point his slow vnmouing fingers at--oh, oh,'

The second and third have the same except that they substitute 'finger'
for fingers. The first Folio, which is followed substantially by the
rest, has:

    'The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne,
    To point his slow, and mouing finger at.'

Rowe:

    'A fixed Figure for the hand of Scorn
    To point his slow and moving Finger at--.'

He is followed by Pope, Theobald, and Hanmer.

Warburton also follows Rowe, except that he reads 'unmoving' for 'and
moving.'

Johnson, Capell and Jennens adopt Warburton's reading.

Capell puts 'O! O!' in a separate line.

Steevens reads with the second and third Quartos, followed by Malone,
Rann and the _Variorum_ Editors.

Malone conjectures:

    'A fixed figure for the scorn of time
    To point his slow unmoving finger at,--'

Mason proposes 'slowly moving' for 'slow unmoving': a conjecture which
has been also made by Mr Collier's MS. corrector and adopted by Mr
Collier in his second edition.

Becket conjectures:

    'A fixed figure and in scorn, for time
    To point his slow-unmoving finger at.'

Jackson:

    'A fix'd figure, for the type of scorn
    To point his low unmoving finger at.'

Mr Knight, in his 'Stratford' Edition, and Mr Staunton adopt Hunter's
conjecture:

    'The fixed figure of the time, for scorn
    To point his slow and moving finger at,--'

Mr Grant White, in his _Shakespeare's Scholar_, expressed his approval
of this conjecture, changing however, 'and moving' to 'unmoving'
in the second line. In his edition he follows, as we do, the second
Quarto. 'The time of scorn' (he says) is a phrase like 'the day of
sorrow,' 'the hour of joy,' or 'the age of progress.'

Dr Cartwright reads:

    'A fixed figure for the time of scorn
    To point his cold unmoving finger at.'

Mr Bailey conjectures:

    'A fixed figure for the time, in scorn
    To point his sly and mocking finger at.'

Mr Bullock proposes to read:

    'A fixed figure for the rhymer's scorn,
    To point his foul unmoving finger at.'


NOTE X.

IV. 2. 183. Mr Collier says that the Devonshire copy of F₁ has the
following: 'I have heard too much: And hell gnaw his bones
Performances....' The mistake was discovered and corrected in other
copies. This accounts for the 'and' which the corrected copies still
retain instead of 'for.'


NOTE XI.

IV. 3. 46-48. In this passage we have followed Capell's arrangement of
the text. The second Quarto has:

        '_Sing willow_, &c.         (Lay by these.)
        _Willow, willow._
    (Prethee hie thee, he'll come anon.)'

The third Quarto has the same arrangement, but misprints
_'fling-willow, &c._'

The first Folio reads:

    '_Sing Willough, &c._          (Lay by these).
    _Willough, Willough._        (Prythee high thee: he'll come anon).'

The second, third, and fourth Folios have 'Lady by these,' a misprint
which was corrected by Rowe in his first, but repeated in his second
edition. Pope, Theobald, Hanmer, and Warburton omitted the words
altogether.


NOTE XII.

V. 2. 7. Rowe, in his first edition, printed the line thus:

    'Put out the Light, and then put out the Light,'

and, in his second,

    'Put out the Light, and then put out _the_ Light,'

in which he was followed by Pope, except that the latter put a
semicolon at the end of the line. Theobald, punctuating thus,

    'Put out the light, and, then, put out the light;'

supposes that the only light in the room is that which Othello carries
in his hand, and which at first he intends to extinguish, but,
changing his mind, sets down to go and kiss Desdemona. He observes,
'The _Players_, in all the Companies wherever I have seen this Tragedy
perform'd, commit an Absurdity here, in making Othello put out the
candle, which, 'tis evident, never was the Poet's intention.'

Hanmer prints:

    'Put out the light: and then--put out _thy_ light.'

Opposite line 13 he adds this stage direction, '_Sets down the Candle,
not putting it out._'

Warburton has:

    'Put out the light, and then--Put out the light?--'

His punctuation is adopted by Johnson.

Capell reads:

    'Put out the light, and then--Put out the light!'

and adds after the next line, as a stage direction, '_Setting down the
Taper._'

Mr Goldwin Smith, regarding the line in question as a stage-direction
which has crept into the text, suggests to us that the passage ought to
be printed as follows:

    'Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.'

                     [_Takes off his sword and then puts out the light._

    'If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, &c.'

or thus:

    '................................alabaster.'

                                                 [_Takes off his sword._

    'Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.'

                                                  [_Puts out the light._

    'If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, &c.'


NOTE XIII.

V. 2. 86. Mr Singer, in his second edition, has here invented a
reading of the first Quarto, from a misinterpretation of Steevens's
note. He says, 'After this speech of Othello, the elder Quarto adds
an invocation from Desdemona, consisting only of "God! God! God!"'
Steevens's words, which Mr Singer adopted in his first edition, were
'consisting only of the sacred name thrice repeated.'


NOTE XIV.

V. 2. 243. Mr Collier in his _Notes and Emendations_ and in the
appendix to _Coleridge's Lectures_ gives 'now' as the insertion of his
MS. corrector. In the note on this passage in his second edition of
_Shakespeare_, he says: '_Here_ in this line is omitted in the Folio,
1623, but inserted in the corr. fo. 1632.'


NOTE XV.

V. 2. 284, 285. The reading given in the text is that of the Quartos,
substantially. The first has literatim thus:

    'O _Desdemona_, _Desdemona_, dead, O, o. o.'

The second and third:

    'O _Desdemona_, _Desdemona_; dead, O, o, o.'

The first Folio:

    'Oh _Desdemon_! dead _Desdemon_: dead. Oh, oh!'

The second:

    'Oh _Desdemon_! dead _Desdemon_: dead. dead. Oh, oh!'

The third:

    'Oh _Desdemona_! dead _Desdemona_: dead, dead. Oh, oh!'

This is followed substantially by the fourth Folio and Rowe.

Pope reads:

    'Oh _Desdemona_! _Desdemona!_ dead, dead! Oh! Oh!'

This is adopted by Theobald, Hanmer, Warburton and Johnson.

Capell reads:

    'O _Desdemone_! dead, _Desdemone_? dead? dead?
    O, o, o!'

Steevens (1773) has:

    'Oh Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
    Dead! oh! oh! oh!'

This reading is followed by Steevens himself in his later editions,
Malone, Rann, the _Variorum_ editors, Singer and Harness. Mr Knight
reads substantially with the first Folio: Mr Collier follows the
Quartos.

Mr Dyce reads:

    'O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead! O!'

Mr Staunton adopts the reading of the first Folio, putting a comma
after the first 'dead.' Mr Grant White follows Mr Dyce.


NOTE XVI.

V. 2. 350. In his note on this passage Theobald says, 'I have restor'd,
_Judian_, from the Elder _Quarto_, as the genuine and more eligible
reading.' All the Quartos we have seen read 'Indian.' He adds, 'I am
satisfied, in his _Judian_, he is alluding to _Herod_; who, in a Fit of
blind Jealousie, threw away such a Jewel of a Wife as _Mariamne_ was to
him.' This interpretation was suggested by Warburton.

'Indian' is read by the Quarto of 1695, Rowe, Pope, Capell, Jennens,
Rann, Knight, Collier, Dyce, Singer (ed. 2), Delius, Staunton, Cowden
Clarke, Hudson and Grant White.

'Judian' or 'Judean' is read by Theobald, Hanmer, Warburton, Johnson,
Steevens, the _Variorum_ editors, Harness and Singer (ed. 1).

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

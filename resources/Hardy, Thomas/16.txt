V.R.  1819–1901
A REVERIE


   MOMENTS the mightiest pass uncalendared,
         And when the Absolute
      In backward Time outgave the deedful word
         Whereby all life is stirred:
   “Let one be born and throned whose mould shall constitute
   The norm of every royal-reckoned attribute,”
         No mortal knew or heard.
      But in due days the purposed Life outshone—
         Serene, sagacious, free;
      —Her waxing seasons bloomed with deeds well done,
         And the world’s heart was won . . .
   Yet may the deed of hers most bright in eyes to be
   Lie hid from ours—as in the All-One’s thought lay she—
         Till ripening years have run.

WAR POEMS


EMBARCATION
(_Southampton Docks_: _October_, 1899)


   HERE, where Vespasian’s legions struck the sands,
   And Cerdic with his Saxons entered in,
   And Henry’s army leapt afloat to win
   Convincing triumphs over neighbour lands,

   Vaster battalions press for further strands,
   To argue in the self-same bloody mode
   Which this late age of thought, and pact, and code,
   Still fails to mend.—Now deckward tramp the bands,
   Yellow as autumn leaves, alive as spring;
   And as each host draws out upon the sea
   Beyond which lies the tragical To-be,
   None dubious of the cause, none murmuring,

   Wives, sisters, parents, wave white hands and smile,
   As if they knew not that they weep the while.



DEPARTURE
(_Southampton Docks_: _October_, 1899)


   WHILE the far farewell music thins and fails,
   And the broad bottoms rip the bearing brine—
   All smalling slowly to the gray sea line—
   And each significant red smoke-shaft pales,

   Keen sense of severance everywhere prevails,
   Which shapes the late long tramp of mounting men
   To seeming words that ask and ask again:
   “How long, O striving Teutons, Slavs, and Gaels
   Must your wroth reasonings trade on lives like these,
   That are as puppets in a playing hand?—
   When shall the saner softer polities
   Whereof we dream, have play in each proud land,
   And patriotism, grown Godlike, scorn to stand
   Bondslave to realms, but circle earth and seas?”



THE COLONEL’S SOLILOQUY
(_Southampton Docks_: _October_, 1899)


   “THE quay recedes.   Hurrah!  Ahead we go! . . .
   It’s true I’ve been accustomed now to home,
   And joints get rusty, and one’s limbs may grow
      More fit to rest than roam.

   “But I can stand as yet fair stress and strain;
   There’s not a little steel beneath the rust;
   My years mount somewhat, but here’s to’t again!
      And if I fall, I must.

   “God knows that for myself I’ve scanty care;
   Past scrimmages have proved as much to all;
   In Eastern lands and South I’ve had my share
      Both of the blade and ball.

   “And where those villains ripped me in the flitch
   With their old iron in my early time,
   I’m apt at change of wind to feel a twitch,
      Or at a change of clime.

   “And what my mirror shows me in the morning
   Has more of blotch and wrinkle than of bloom;
   My eyes, too, heretofore all glasses scorning,
      Have just a touch of rheum . . .

   “Now sounds ‘The Girl I’ve left behind me,’—Ah,
   The years, the ardours, wakened by that tune!
   Time was when, with the crowd’s farewell ‘Hurrah!’
      ’Twould lift me to the moon.

   “But now it’s late to leave behind me one
   Who if, poor soul, her man goes underground,
   Will not recover as she might have done
      In days when hopes abound.

   “She’s waving from the wharfside, palely grieving,
   As down we draw . . . Her tears make little show,
   Yet now she suffers more than at my leaving
      Some twenty years ago.

   “I pray those left at home will care for her!
   I shall come back; I have before; though when
   The Girl you leave behind you is a grandmother,
      Things may not be as then.”



THE GOING OF THE BATTERY
WIVES’ LAMENT
(_November_ 2, 1899)


                                    I

   O IT was sad enough, weak enough, mad enough—
   Light in their loving as soldiers can be—
   First to risk choosing them, leave alone losing them
   Now, in far battle, beyond the South Sea! . . .

                                    II

   —Rain came down drenchingly; but we unblenchingly
   Trudged on beside them through mirk and through mire,
   They stepping steadily—only too readily!—
   Scarce as if stepping brought parting-time nigher.

                                   III

   Great guns were gleaming there, living things seeming there,
   Cloaked in their tar-cloths, upmouthed to the night;
   Wheels wet and yellow from axle to felloe,
   Throats blank of sound, but prophetic to sight.

                                    IV

   Gas-glimmers drearily, blearily, eerily
   Lit our pale faces outstretched for one kiss,
   While we stood prest to them, with a last quest to them
   Not to court perils that honour could miss.

                                    V

   Sharp were those sighs of ours, blinded these eyes of ours,
   When at last moved away under the arch
   All we loved.   Aid for them each woman prayed for them,
   Treading back slowly the track of their march.

                                    VI

   Someone said: “Nevermore will they come: evermore
   Are they now lost to us.”  O it was wrong!
   Though may be hard their ways, some Hand will guard their ways,
   Bear them through safely, in brief time or long.

                                   VII

   —Yet, voices haunting us, daunting us, taunting us,
   Hint in the night-time when life beats are low
   Other and graver things . . . Hold we to braver things,
   Wait we, in trust, what Time’s fulness shall show.



AT THE WAR OFFICE, LONDON

                                    I

   LAST year I called this world of gain-givings
   The darkest thinkable, and questioned sadly
   If my own land could heave its pulse less gladly,
   So charged it seemed with circumstance whence springs
      The tragedy of things.

                                    II

   Yet at that censured time no heart was rent
   Or feature blanched of parent, wife, or daughter
   By hourly blazoned sheets of listed slaughter;
   Death waited Nature’s wont; Peace smiled unshent
      From Ind to Occident.



A CHRISTMAS GHOST-STORY


   SOUTH of the Line, inland from far Durban,
   A mouldering soldier lies—your countryman.
   Awry and doubled up are his gray bones,
   And on the breeze his puzzled phantom moans
   Nightly to clear Canopus: “I would know
   By whom and when the All-Earth-gladdening Law
   Of Peace, brought in by that Man Crucified,
   Was ruled to be inept, and set aside?
   And what of logic or of truth appears
   In tacking ‘Anno Domini’ to the years?
   Near twenty-hundred livened thus have hied,
   But tarries yet the Cause for which He died.”

   THEY throw in Drummer Hodge, to rest
      Uncoffined—just as found:
   His landmark is a kopje-crest
      That breaks the veldt around;
   And foreign constellations west
      Each night above his mound.

                                    II

   Young Hodge the Drummer never knew—
      Fresh from his Wessex home—
   The meaning of the broad Karoo,
      The Bush, the dusty loam,
   And why uprose to nightly view
      Strange stars amid the gloam.

                                   III

   Yet portion of that unknown plain
      Will Hodge for ever be;
   His homely Northern breast and brain
      Grow up a Southern tree.
   And strange-eyed constellations reign
      His stars eternally.

                               THE TRAGEDY

   SHE sits in the tawny vapour
         That the City lanes have uprolled,
         Behind whose webby fold on fold
   Like a waning taper
      The street-lamp glimmers cold.

   A messenger’s knock cracks smartly,
         Flashed news is in her hand
         Of meaning it dazes to understand
   Though shaped so shortly:
      _He—has fallen—in the far South Land_ . . .

   ’Tis the morrow; the fog hangs thicker,
         The postman nears and goes:
         A letter is brought whose lines disclose
   By the firelight flicker
      His hand, whom the worm now knows:

   Fresh—firm—penned in highest feather—
         Page-full of his hoped return,
         And of home-planned jaunts by brake and burn
   In the summer weather,
      And of new love that they would learn.



THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN


                                    I

      The thick lids of Night closed upon me
         Alone at the Bill
         Of the Isle by the Race {253}—
      Many-caverned, bald, wrinkled of face—
   And with darkness and silence the spirit was on me
         To brood and be still.

                                    II

      No wind fanned the flats of the ocean,
         Or promontory sides,
         Or the ooze by the strand,
      Or the bent-bearded slope of the land,
   Whose base took its rest amid everlong motion
         Of criss-crossing tides.

                                   III

      Soon from out of the Southward seemed nearing
         A whirr, as of wings
         Waved by mighty-vanned flies,
      Or by night-moths of measureless size,
   And in softness and smoothness well-nigh beyond hearing
         Of corporal things.

                                    IV

      And they bore to the bluff, and alighted—
         A dim-discerned train
         Of sprites without mould,
      Frameless souls none might touch or might hold—
   On the ledge by the turreted lantern, farsighted
         By men of the main.

                                    V

      And I heard them say “Home!” and I knew them
         For souls of the felled
         On the earth’s nether bord
      Under Capricorn, whither they’d warred,
   And I neared in my awe, and gave heedfulness to them
         With breathings inheld.

                                    VI

      Then, it seemed, there approached from the northward
         A senior soul-flame
         Of the like filmy hue:
      And he met them and spake: “Is it you,
   O my men?”  Said they, “Aye!  We bear homeward and hearthward
         To list to our fame!”

                                   VII

      “I’ve flown there before you,” he said then:
         “Your households are well;
         But—your kin linger less
      On your glory arid war-mightiness
   Than on dearer things.”—“Dearer?” cried these from the dead then,
         “Of what do they tell?”

                                   VIII

      “Some mothers muse sadly, and murmur
         Your doings as boys—
         Recall the quaint ways
      Of your babyhood’s innocent days.
   Some pray that, ere dying, your faith had grown firmer,
         And higher your joys.

                                    IX

      “A father broods: ‘Would I had set him
         To some humble trade,
         And so slacked his high fire,
      And his passionate martial desire;
   Had told him no stories to woo him and whet him
         To this due crusade!”

                                    X

      “And, General, how hold out our sweethearts,
         Sworn loyal as doves?”
         —“Many mourn; many think
      It is not unattractive to prink
   Them in sables for heroes.   Some fickle and fleet hearts
         Have found them new loves.”

                                    XI

      “And our wives?” quoth another resignedly,
         “Dwell they on our deeds?”
         —“Deeds of home; that live yet
      Fresh as new—deeds of fondness or fret;
   Ancient words that were kindly expressed or unkindly,
         These, these have their heeds.”

                                   XII

      —“Alas! then it seems that our glory
         Weighs less in their thought
         Than our old homely acts,
      And the long-ago commonplace facts
   Of our lives—held by us as scarce part of our story,
         And rated as nought!”

                                   XIII

      Then bitterly some: “Was it wise now
         To raise the tomb-door
         For such knowledge?  Away!”
      But the rest: “Fame we prized till to-day;
   Yet that hearts keep us green for old kindness we prize now
         A thousand times more!”

                                   XIV

      Thus speaking, the trooped apparitions
         Began to disband
         And resolve them in two:
      Those whose record was lovely and true
   Bore to northward for home: those of bitter traditions
         Again left the land,

                                    XV

      And, towering to seaward in legions,
         They paused at a spot
         Overbending the Race—
      That engulphing, ghast, sinister place—
   Whither headlong they plunged, to the fathomless regions
         Of myriads forgot.

                                   XVI

      And the spirits of those who were homing
         Passed on, rushingly,
         Like the Pentecost Wind;
      And the whirr of their wayfaring thinned
   And surceased on the sky, and but left in the gloaming
         Sea-mutterings and me.

   AT last!  In sight of home again,
         Of home again;
   No more to range and roam again
      As at that bygone time?

   Should wait, and wish, but greet no more
      Your faces round our fires;
   That, in a while, uncharily
         And drearily
   Men gave their lives—even wearily,
      Like those whom living tires.

   And now you are nearing home again,
         Dears, home again;
   No more, may be, to roam again

THE SICK GOD


                                    I

      IN days when men had joy of war,
   A God of Battles sped each mortal jar;
      The peoples pledged him heart and hand,
      From Israel’s land to isles afar.

                                    II

      His crimson form, with clang and chime,
   Flashed on each murk and murderous meeting-time,
      And kings invoked, for rape and raid,
      His fearsome aid in rune and rhyme.

                                   III

      On bruise and blood-hole, scar and seam,
   On blade and bolt, he flung his fulgid beam:
      His haloes rayed the very gore,
      And corpses wore his glory-gleam.

                                    IV

      Often an early King or Queen,
   And storied hero onward, knew his sheen;
      ’Twas glimpsed by Wolfe, by Ney anon,
      And Nelson on his blue demesne.

                                    V

      But new light spread.  That god’s gold nimb
   And blazon have waned dimmer and more dim;
      Even his flushed form begins to fade,
      Till but a shade is left of him.

                                    VI

      That modern meditation broke
   His spell, that penmen’s pleadings dealt a stroke,
      Say some; and some that crimes too dire
      Did much to mire his crimson cloak.

                                   VII

      Yea, seeds of crescive sympathy
   Were sown by those more excellent than he,
      Long known, though long contemned till then—
      The gods of men in amity.

                                   VIII

      Souls have grown seers, and thought out-brings
   The mournful many-sidedness of things

      And fury-fires by gaingivings!

                                    IX

      He scarce impassions champions now;
   They do and dare, but tensely—pale of brow;
      And would they fain uplift the arm
      Of that faint form they know not how.

                                    X

      Yet wars arise, though zest grows cold;
   Wherefore, at whiles, as ’twere in ancient mould
      He looms, bepatched with paint and lath;
      But never hath he seemed the old!

                                    XI

      Let men rejoice, let men deplore.
   The lurid Deity of heretofore
      Succumbs to one of saner nod;
      The Battle-god is god no more.




POEMS OF PILGRIMAGE


GENOA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN
(March, 1887)


      O EPIC-FAMED, god-haunted Central Sea,
      Heave careless of the deep wrong done to thee
   When from Torino’s track I saw thy face first flash on me.

      And multimarbled Genova the Proud,
      Gleam all unconscious how, wide-lipped, up-browed,
   I first beheld thee clad—not as the Beauty but the Dowd.

      Out from a deep-delved way my vision lit
      On housebacks pink, green, ochreous—where a slit
   Shoreward ’twixt row and row revealed the classic blue through it.

      And thereacross waved fishwives’ high-hung smocks,
      Chrome kerchiefs, scarlet hose, darned underfrocks;
   Since when too oft my dreams of thee, O Queen, that frippery mocks:

      Whereat I grieve, Superba! . . . Afterhours
      Within Palazzo Doria’s orange bowers
   Went far to mend these marrings of thy soul-subliming powers.

      But, Queen, such squalid undress none should see,
      Those dream-endangering eyewounds no more be
   Where lovers first behold thy form in pilgrimage to thee.



SHELLEY’S SKYLARK
(_The neighbourhood of Leghorn_: _March_, 1887)


   SOMEWHERE afield here something lies
   In Earth’s oblivious eyeless trust
   That moved a poet to prophecies—
   A pinch of unseen, unguarded dust

   The dust of the lark that Shelley heard,
   And made immortal through times to be;—
   Though it only lived like another bird,
   And knew not its immortality.

   Lived its meek life; then, one day, fell—
   A little ball of feather and bone;
   And how it perished, when piped farewell,
   And where it wastes, are alike unknown.

   Maybe it rests in the loam I view,
   Maybe it throbs in a myrtle’s green,
   Maybe it sleeps in the coming hue
   Of a grape on the slopes of yon inland scene.

   Go find it, faeries, go and find
   That tiny pinch of priceless dust,
   And bring a casket silver-lined,
   And framed of gold that gems encrust;

   And we will lay it safe therein,
   And consecrate it to endless time;
   For it inspired a bard to win
   Ecstatic heights in thought and rhyme.



IN THE OLD THEATRE, FIESOLE
(_April_, 1887)


   I TRACED the Circus whose gray stones incline
   Where Rome and dim Etruria interjoin,
   Till came a child who showed an ancient coin
   That bore the image of a Constantine.

   She lightly passed; nor did she once opine
   How, better than all books, she had raised for me
   In swift perspective Europe’s history
   Through the vast years of Cæsar’s sceptred line.

   For in my distant plot of English loam
   ’Twas but to delve, and straightway there to find
   Coins of like impress.  As with one half blind
   Whom common simples cure, her act flashed home
   In that mute moment to my opened mind
   The power, the pride, the reach of perished Rome.



ROME: ON THE PALATINE
(_April_, 1887)


   WE walked where Victor Jove was shrined awhile,
   And passed to Livia’s rich red mural show,
   Whence, thridding cave and Criptoportico,
   We gained Caligula’s dissolving pile.

   And each ranked ruin tended to beguile
   The outer sense, and shape itself as though
   It wore its marble hues, its pristine glow
   Of scenic frieze and pompous peristyle.

   When lo, swift hands, on strings nigh over-head,
   Began to melodize a waltz by Strauss:
   It stirred me as I stood, in Cæsar’s house,
   Raised the old routs Imperial lyres had led,

   And blended pulsing life with lives long done,
   Till Time seemed fiction, Past and Present one.

(_April_, 1887)


   THESE numbered cliffs and gnarls of masonry
   Outskeleton Time’s central city, Rome;
   Whereof each arch, entablature, and dome
   Lies bare in all its gaunt anatomy.

   And cracking frieze and rotten metope
   Express, as though they were an open tome
   Top-lined with caustic monitory gnome;
   “Dunces, Learn here to spell Humanity!”

   And yet within these ruins’ very shade
   The singing workmen shape and set and join
   Their frail new mansion’s stuccoed cove and quoin
   With no apparent sense that years abrade,
   Though each rent wall their feeble works invade
   Once shamed all such in power of pier and groin.



ROME
THE VATICAN—SALA DELLE MUSE
(1887)


   I SAT in the Muses’ Hall at the mid of the day,
   And it seemed to grow still, and the people to pass away,
   And the chiselled shapes to combine in a haze of sun,
   Till beside a Carrara column there gleamed forth One.

   She was nor this nor that of those beings divine,
   But each and the whole—an essence of all the Nine;
   With tentative foot she neared to my halting-place,
   A pensive smile on her sweet, small, marvellous face.

   “Regarded so long, we render thee sad?” said she.
   “Not you,” sighed I, “but my own inconstancy!
   I worship each and each; in the morning one,
   And then, alas! another at sink of sun.

   “To-day my soul clasps Form; but where is my troth
   Of yesternight with Tune: can one cleave to both?”
   —“Be not perturbed,” said she.  “Though apart in fame,
   As I and my sisters are one, those, too, are the same.

   —“But my loves go further—to Story, and Dance, and Hymn,
   The lover of all in a sun-sweep is fool to whim—
   Is swayed like a river-weed as the ripples run!”
   —“Nay, wight, thou sway’st not.  These are but phases of one;

   “And that one is I; and I am projected from thee,
   One that out of thy brain and heart thou causest to be—
   Extern to thee nothing.  Grieve not, nor thyself becall,
   Woo where thou wilt; and rejoice thou canst love at all!”



ROME
AT THE PYRAMID OF CESTIUS
NEAR THE GRAVES OF SHELLEY AND KEATS
(1887)


         WHO, then, was Cestius,
         And what is he to me?—
   Amid thick thoughts and memories multitudinous
         One thought alone brings he.

         I can recall no word
         Of anything he did;
   For me he is a man who died and was interred
         To leave a pyramid

         Whose purpose was exprest
         Not with its first design,
   Nor till, far down in Time, beside it found their rest
         Two countrymen of mine.

         Cestius in life, maybe,
         Slew, breathed out threatening;
   I know not.  This I know: in death all silently
         He does a kindlier thing,

         In beckoning pilgrim feet
         With marble finger high
   To where, by shadowy wall and history-haunted street,
         Those matchless singers lie . . .

         —Say, then, he lived and died
         That stones which bear his name
   Should mark, through Time, where two immortal Shades abide;
         It is an ample fame.

_June_ 27, 1897


(_The_ 110_th_ _anniversary of the completion of the_ “_Decline and
Fall_” _at the same hour and place_)

         A SPIRIT seems to pass,
      Formal in pose, but grave and grand withal:
      He contemplates a volume stout and tall,
   And far lamps fleck him through the thin acacias.

         Anon the book is closed,
      With “It is finished!”  And at the alley’s end
      He turns, and soon on me his glances bend;
   And, as from earth, comes speech—small, muted, yet composed.

         “How fares the Truth now?—Ill?
      —Do pens but slily further her advance?
      May one not speed her but in phrase askance?
   Do scribes aver the Comic to be Reverend still?

         “Still rule those minds on earth
      At whom sage Milton’s wormwood words were hurled:
      ‘_Truth like a bastard comes into the world_
   _Never without ill-fame to him who gives her birth_’?”



ZERMATT
TO THE MATTERHORN
(_June_-_July_, 1897)


   THIRTY-TWO years since, up against the sun,
   Seven shapes, thin atomies to lower sight,
   Labouringly leapt and gained thy gabled height,
   And four lives paid for what the seven had won.

   They were the first by whom the deed was done,
   And when I look at thee, my mind takes flight
   To that day’s tragic feat of manly might,
   As though, till then, of history thou hadst none.

   Yet ages ere men topped thee, late and soon
   Thou watch’dst each night the planets lift and lower;
   Thou gleam’dst to Joshua’s pausing sun and moon,
   And brav’dst the tokening sky when Cæsar’s power
   Approached its bloody end: yea, saw’st that Noon
   When darkness filled the earth till the ninth hour.



THE BRIDGE OF LODI {290}
(_Spring_, 1887)


                                    I

   WHEN of tender mind and body
      I was moved by minstrelsy,
   And that strain “The Bridge of Lodi”
      Brought a strange delight to me.

                                    II

   In the battle-breathing jingle
      Of its forward-footing tune
   I could see the armies mingle,
      And the columns cleft and hewn

                                   III

   On that far-famed spot by Lodi
      Where Napoleon clove his way
   To his fame, when like a god he
      Bent the nations to his sway.

                                    IV

   Hence the tune came capering to me
      While I traced the Rhone and Po;
   Nor could Milan’s Marvel woo me
      From the spot englamoured so.

                                    V

   And to-day, sunlit and smiling,
      Here I stand upon the scene,
   With its saffron walls, dun tiling,
      And its meads of maiden green,

                                    VI

   Even as when the trackway thundered
      With the charge of grenadiers,
   And the blood of forty hundred
      Splashed its parapets and piers . . .

                                   VII

   Any ancient crone I’d toady
      Like a lass in young-eyed prime,
   Could she tell some tale of Lodi
      At that moving mighty time.

                                   VIII

   So, I ask the wives of Lodi
      For traditions of that day;
   But alas! not anybody
      Seems to know of such a fray.

                                    IX

   And they heed but transitory
      Marketings in cheese and meat,
   Till I judge that Lodi’s story
      Is extinct in Lodi’s street.

                                    X

   Yet while here and there they thrid them
      In their zest to sell and buy,
   Let me sit me down amid them
      And behold those thousands die . . .

                                    XI

   —Not a creature cares in Lodi
      How Napoleon swept each arch,
   Or where up and downward trod he,
      Or for his memorial March!

                                   XII

   So that wherefore should I be here,
      Watching Adda lip the lea,
   When the whole romance to see here
      Is the dream I bring with me?

                                   XIII

   And why sing “The Bridge of Lodi”
      As I sit thereon and swing,
   When none shows by smile or nod he
      Guesses why or what I sing? . . .

                                   XIV

   Since all Lodi, low and head ones,
      Seem to pass that story by,
   It may be the Lodi-bred ones
      Rate it truly, and not I.

                                    XV

   Once engrossing Bridge of Lodi,
      Is thy claim to glory gone?
   Must I pipe a palinody,
      Or be silent thereupon?

                                   XVI

   And if here, from strand to steeple,
      Be no stone to fame the fight,
   Must I say the Lodi people
      Are but viewing crime aright?

                                   XVII

   Nay; I’ll sing “The Bridge of Lodi”—
      That long-loved, romantic thing,
   Though none show by smile or nod he
      Guesses why and what I sing!

   MY ardours for emprize nigh lost

   I shrink to seek a modern coast
   Whose riper times have yet to be;
   Where the new regions claim them free
   From that long drip of human tears
   Which peoples old in tragedy
   Have left upon the centuried years.

                                    II

   For, wonning in these ancient lands,
   Enchased and lettered as a tomb,
   And scored with prints of perished hands,
   And chronicled with dates of doom,
   Though my own Being bear no bloom
   I trace the lives such scenes enshrine,
   Give past exemplars present room,
   And their experience count as mine.




MISCELLANEOUS POEMS


THE MOTHER MOURNS


   WHEN mid-autumn’s moan shook the night-time,
      And sedges were horny,
   And summer’s green wonderwork faltered
      On leaze and in lane,

   I fared Yell’ham-Firs way, where dimly
      Came wheeling around me
   Those phantoms obscure and insistent
      That shadows unchain.

   Till airs from the needle-thicks brought me
      A low lamentation,
   As ’twere of a tree-god disheartened,
      Perplexed, or in pain.

   And, heeding, it awed me to gather
      That Nature herself there
   Was breathing in aërie accents,
      With dirgeful refrain,

   Weary plaint that Mankind, in these late days,
      Had grieved her by holding
   Her ancient high fame of perfection
      In doubt and disdain . . .

   —“I had not proposed me a Creature
      (She soughed) so excelling
   All else of my kingdom in compass
      And brightness of brain

   “As to read my defects with a god-glance,
      Uncover each vestige
   Of old inadvertence, annunciate
      Each flaw and each stain!

   “My purpose went not to develop
      Such insight in Earthland;
   Such potent appraisements affront me,
      And sadden my reign!

   “Why loosened I olden control here
      To mechanize skywards,
   Undeeming great scope could outshape in
      A globe of such grain?

   “Man’s mountings of mind-sight I checked not,
      Till range of his vision
   Has topped my intent, and found blemish
      Throughout my domain.

   “He holds as inept his own soul-shell—
      My deftest achievement—
   Contemns me for fitful inventions
      Ill-timed and inane:

   “No more sees my sun as a Sanct-shape,
      My moon as the Night-queen,
   My stars as august and sublime ones
      That influences rain:

   “Reckons gross and ignoble my teaching,
      Immoral my story,
   My love-lights a lure, that my species
      May gather and gain.

   “‘Give me,’ he has said, ‘but the matter
      And means the gods lot her,
   My brain could evolve a creation
      More seemly, more sane.’

   —“If ever a naughtiness seized me
      To woo adulation
   From creatures more keen than those crude ones
      That first formed my train—

   “If inly a moment I murmured,
      ‘The simple praise sweetly,
   But sweetlier the sage’—and did rashly
      Man’s vision unrein,

   “I rue it! . . . His guileless forerunners,
      Whose brains I could blandish,
   To measure the deeps of my mysteries
      Applied them in vain.

   “From them my waste aimings and futile
      I subtly could cover;
   ‘Every best thing,’ said they, ‘to best purpose
      Her powers preordain.’—

   “No more such! . . . My species are dwindling,
      My forests grow barren,
   My popinjays fail from their tappings,
      My larks from their strain.

   “My leopardine beauties are rarer,
      My tusky ones vanish,
   My children have aped mine own slaughters
      To quicken my wane.

   “Let me grow, then, but mildews and mandrakes,
      And slimy distortions,
   Let nevermore things good and lovely
      To me appertain;

   “For Reason is rank in my temples,
      And Vision unruly,
   And chivalrous laud of my cunning
      Is heard not again!”



“I SAID TO LOVE”


         I SAID to Love,
   “It is not now as in old days
   When men adored thee and thy ways
         All else above;
   Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One
   Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,”
         I said to Love.

         I said to him,
   “We now know more of thee than then;
   We were but weak in judgment when,
         With hearts abrim,
   We clamoured thee that thou would’st please
   Inflict on us thine agonies,”
         I said to him.

         I said to Love,
   “Thou art not young, thou art not fair,
   No faery darts, no cherub air,
         Nor swan, nor dove
   Are thine; but features pitiless,
   And iron daggers of distress,”
         I said to Love.

         “Depart then, Love! . . .
   —Man’s race shall end, dost threaten thou?
   The age to come the man of now
         Know nothing of?—
   We fear not such a threat from thee;
   We are too old in apathy!
   _Mankind shall cease_.—So let it be,”
         I said to Love.



A COMMONPLACE DAY


      THE day is turning ghost,
   And scuttles from the kalendar in fits and furtively,
      To join the anonymous host
   Of those that throng oblivion; ceding his place, maybe,
      To one of like degree.

      I part the fire-gnawed logs,
   Rake forth the embers, spoil the busy flames, and lay the ends
      Upon the shining dogs;
   Further and further from the nooks the twilight’s stride extends,
      And beamless black impends.

      Nothing of tiniest worth
   Have I wrought, pondered, planned; no one thing asking blame or
   praise,
      Since the pale corpse-like birth
   Of this diurnal unit, bearing blanks in all its rays—
      Dullest of dull-hued Days!

      Wanly upon the panes
   The rain slides as have slid since morn my colourless thoughts; and
   yet
      Here, while Day’s presence wanes,
   And over him the sepulchre-lid is slowly lowered and set,
      He wakens my regret.

      Regret—though nothing dear
   That I wot of, was toward in the wide world at his prime,
      Or bloomed elsewhere than here,
   To die with his decease, and leave a memory sweet, sublime,
      Or mark him out in Time . . .

      —Yet, maybe, in some soul,
   In some spot undiscerned on sea or land, some impulse rose,
      Or some intent upstole
   Of that enkindling ardency from whose maturer glows
      The world’s amendment flows;

      But which, benumbed at birth
   By momentary chance or wile, has missed its hope to be
      Embodied on the earth;
   And undervoicings of this loss to man’s futurity
      May wake regret in me.



AT A LUNAR ECLIPSE


   THY shadow, Earth, from Pole to Central Sea,
   Now steals along upon the Moon’s meek shine
   In even monochrome and curving line
   Of imperturbable serenity.

   How shall I link such sun-cast symmetry
   With the torn troubled form I know as thine,
   That profile, placid as a brow divine,
   With continents of moil and misery?

   And can immense Mortality but throw
   So small a shade, and Heaven’s high human scheme
   Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies?

   Is such the stellar gauge of earthly show,
   Nation at war with nation, brains that teem,
   Heroes, and women fairer than the skies?

      Why weaves she not her world-webs to according lutes and tabors,
   With nevermore this too remorseful air upon her face,

      In her wonderworks yea surely has she wounded where she loves.
      The sense of ills misdealt for blisses blanks the mien most
   queenly,
   Self-smitings kill self-joys; and everywhere beneath the sun
         Such deeds her hands have done.”

      Whence it comes that all unwittingly she wounds the lives she
   loves?
      That sightless are those orbs of hers?—which bar to her omniscience
   Brings those fearful unfulfilments, that red ravage through her zones
         Whereat all creation groans.

   “She whispers it in each pathetic strenuous slow endeavour,

      Yet her primal doom pursues her, faultful, fatal is she ever;
   Though so deft and nigh to vision is her facile finger-touch
         That the seers marvel much.

   Assist her where thy creaturely dependence can or may,

TO LIFE


      O LIFE with the sad seared face,
         I weary of seeing thee,
   And thy draggled cloak, and thy hobbling pace,
         And thy too-forced pleasantry!

      I know what thou would’st tell
         Of Death, Time, Destiny—
   I have known it long, and know, too, well
         What it all means for me.

      But canst thou not array
         Thyself in rare disguise,
   And feign like truth, for one mad day,
         That Earth is Paradise?

      I’ll tune me to the mood,

      “World-weaver!” he replies,
      “I scan all thy domain;
      But since nor joy nor pain
   Doth my clear substance recognize,
      I read thy realms in vain.

THE PROBLEM


      SHALL we conceal the Case, or tell it—
         We who believe the evidence?
      Here and there the watch-towers knell it
         With a sullen significance,
   Heard of the few who hearken intently and carry an eagerly upstrained
   sense.

      Hearts that are happiest hold not by it;
         Better we let, then, the old view reign;
      Since there is peace in it, why decry it?
         Since there is comfort, why disdain?
   Note not the pigment the while that the painting determines humanity’s
   joy and pain!



THE SUBALTERNS

   “POOR wanderer,” said the leaden sky,
      “I fain would lighten thee,
   But there be laws in force on high
      Which say it must not be.”

                                    II

   —“I would not freeze thee, shorn one,” cried
      The North, “knew I but how
   To warm my breath, to slack my stride;
      But I am ruled as thou.”

                                   III

   —“To-morrow I attack thee, wight,”
      Said Sickness.  “Yet I swear
   I bear thy little ark no spite,
      But am bid enter there.”

                                    IV

   —“Come hither, Son,” I heard Death say;
      “I did not will a grave
   Should end thy pilgrimage to-day,
      But I, too, am a slave!”

                                    V

   We smiled upon each other then,
      And life to me wore less
   That fell contour it wore ere when
      They owned their passiveness.



THE SLEEP-WORKER


   WHEN wilt thou wake, O Mother, wake and see—
   As one who, held in trance, has laboured long
   By vacant rote and prepossession strong—
   The coils that thou hast wrought unwittingly;

   Wherein have place, unrealized by thee,
   Fair growths, foul cankers, right enmeshed with wrong,
   Strange orchestras of victim-shriek and song,
   And curious blends of ache and ecstasy?—

   Should that morn come, and show thy opened eyes
   All that Life’s palpitating tissues feel,
   How wilt thou bear thyself in thy surprise?—

   Wilt thou destroy, in one wild shock of shame,
   Thy whole high heaving firmamental frame,
   Or patiently adjust, amend, and heal?



THE BULLFINCHES


      BROTHER Bulleys, let us sing
      From the dawn till evening!—
   For we know not that we go not
      When the day’s pale pinions fold
      Unto those who sang of old.

      When I flew to Blackmoor Vale,
      Whence the green-gowned faeries hail,
   Roosting near them I could hear them
      Speak of queenly Nature’s ways,
      Means, and moods,—well known to fays.

      All we creatures, nigh and far
      (Said they there), the Mother’s are:
   Yet she never shows endeavour
      To protect from warrings wild
      Bird or beast she calls her child.

      Busy in her handsome house
      Known as Space, she falls a-drowse;
   Yet, in seeming, works on dreaming,
      While beneath her groping hands
      Fiends make havoc in her bands.

      How her hussif’ry succeeds
      She unknows or she unheeds,
   All things making for Death’s taking!
      —So the green-gowned faeries say
      Living over Blackmoor way.

      Come then, brethren, let us sing,
      From the dawn till evening!—
   For we know not that we go not
      When the day’s pale pinions fold
      Unto those who sang of old.



GOD-FORGOTTEN


      I TOWERED far, and lo!  I stood within
      The presence of the Lord Most High,
   Sent thither by the sons of earth, to win
         Some answer to their cry.

      —“The Earth, say’st thou?  The Human race?
      By Me created?  Sad its lot?
   Nay: I have no remembrance of such place:
         Such world I fashioned not.”—

      —“O Lord, forgive me when I say
      Thou spak’st the word, and mad’st it all.”—
   “The Earth of men—let me bethink me . . . Yea!
         I dimly do recall

      “Some tiny sphere I built long back
      (Mid millions of such shapes of mine)
   So named . . . It perished, surely—not a wrack
         Remaining, or a sign?

      “It lost my interest from the first,
      My aims therefor succeeding ill;
   Haply it died of doing as it durst?”—
         “Lord, it existeth still.”—

      “Dark, then, its life!  For not a cry
      Of aught it bears do I now hear;
   Of its own act the threads were snapt whereby
         Its plaints had reached mine ear.

      “It used to ask for gifts of good,
      Till came its severance self-entailed,
   When sudden silence on that side ensued,
         And has till now prevailed.

      “All other orbs have kept in touch;
      Their voicings reach me speedily:
   Thy people took upon them overmuch
         In sundering them from me!

      “And it is strange—though sad enough—
      Earth’s race should think that one whose call
   Frames, daily, shining spheres of flawless stuff
         Must heed their tainted ball! . . .

      “But say’st thou ’tis by pangs distraught,
      And strife, and silent suffering?—
   Deep grieved am I that injury should be wrought
         Even on so poor a thing!

      “Thou should’st have learnt that _Not to Mend_
      For Me could mean but _Not to Know_:
   Hence, Messengers! and straightway put an end
         To what men undergo.” . . .

      Homing at dawn, I thought to see
      One of the Messengers standing by.
   —Oh, childish thought! . . . Yet oft it comes to me
         When trouble hovers nigh.



THE BEDRIDDEN PEASANT
TO AN UNKNOWING GOD


   MUCH wonder I—here long low-laid—
      That this dead wall should be
   Betwixt the Maker and the made,
      Between Thyself and me!

   For, say one puts a child to nurse,
      He eyes it now and then
   To know if better ’tis, or worse,
      And if it mourn, and when.

   But Thou, Lord, giv’st us men our clay
      In helpless bondage thus
   To Time and Chance, and seem’st straightway
      To think no more of us!

   That some disaster cleft Thy scheme
      And tore us wide apart,
   So that no cry can cross, I deem;
      For Thou art mild of heart,

   And would’st not shape and shut us in
      Where voice can not he heard:
   ’Tis plain Thou meant’st that we should win
      Thy succour by a word.

   Might but Thy sense flash down the skies
      Like man’s from clime to clime,
   Thou would’st not let me agonize
      Through my remaining time;

   But, seeing how much Thy creatures bear—
      Lame, starved, or maimed, or blind—
   Thou’dst heal the ills with quickest care
      Of me and all my kind.

   Then, since Thou mak’st not these things be,
      But these things dost not know,
   I’ll praise Thee as were shown to me
      The mercies Thou would’st show!



BY THE EARTH’S CORPSE


                                    I

      “O LORD, why grievest Thou?—
      Since Life has ceased to be
      Upon this globe, now cold
      As lunar land and sea,
   And humankind, and fowl, and fur
      Are gone eternally,
   All is the same to Thee as ere
      They knew mortality.”

                                    II

   “O Time,” replied the Lord,
      “Thou read’st me ill, I ween;
   Were all _the same_, I should not grieve
      At that late earthly scene,
   Now blestly past—though planned by me
      With interest close and keen!—
   Nay, nay: things now are _not_ the same
      As they have earlier been.

      “Written indelibly
      On my eternal mind
      Are all the wrongs endured
      By Earth’s poor patient kind,
   Which my too oft unconscious hand
      Let enter undesigned.
   No god can cancel deeds foredone,
      Or thy old coils unwind!

      “As when, in Noë’s days,
      I whelmed the plains with sea,
      So at this last, when flesh
      And herb but fossils be,
   And, all extinct, their piteous dust
      Revolves obliviously,
   That I made Earth, and life, and man,
      It still repenteth me!”



MUTE OPINION


                                    I

   I TRAVERSED a dominion
   Whose spokesmen spake out strong
   Their purpose and opinion
   Through pulpit, press, and song.
   I scarce had means to note there
   A large-eyed few, and dumb,
   Who thought not as those thought there
   That stirred the heat and hum.

                                    II

   When, grown a Shade, beholding
   That land in lifetime trode,
   To learn if its unfolding
   Fulfilled its clamoured code,
   I saw, in web unbroken,
   Its history outwrought
   Not as the loud had spoken,
   But as the mute had thought.



TO AN UNBORN PAUPER CHILD


                                    I

      BREATHE not, hid Heart: cease silently,
      And though thy birth-hour beckons thee,
         Sleep the long sleep:
         The Doomsters heap
      Travails and teens around us here,
   And Time-wraiths turn our songsingings to fear.

      Hark, how the peoples surge and sigh,

         Hopes dwindle; yea,
         Faiths waste away,
      Affections and enthusiasms numb;
   Thou canst not mend these things if thou dost come.

      Had I the ear of wombèd souls
      Ere their terrestrial chart unrolls,
         And thou wert free
         To cease, or be,
      Then would I tell thee all I know,
   And put it to thee: Wilt thou take Life so?

                                    IV

      Vain vow!  No hint of mine may hence
      To theeward fly: to thy locked sense
         Explain none can
         Life’s pending plan:
      Thou wilt thy ignorant entry make
   Though skies spout fire and blood and nations quake.

      Fain would I, dear, find some shut plot
      Of earth’s wide wold for thee, where not
         One tear, one qualm,
         Should break the calm.
      But I am weak as thou and bare;
   No man can change the common lot to rare.

                                    VI

      Must come and bide.  And such are we—
      Unreasoning, sanguine, visionary—
         That I can hope
         Health, love, friends, scope
      In full for thee; can dream thou’lt find
   Joys seldom yet attained by humankind!



TO FLOWERS FROM ITALY IN WINTER


   SUNNED in the South, and here to-day;
      —If all organic things
   Be sentient, Flowers, as some men say,

      From this bleak spot of thorn,
   And birch, and fir, and frozen white
      Expanse of the forlorn?

   Frail luckless exiles hither brought!
      Your dust will not regain
   Old sunny haunts of Classic thought
      When you shall waste and wane;

ON A FINE MORNING


   WHENCE comes Solace?—Not from seeing
   What is doing, suffering, being,
   Not from noting Life’s conditions,
   Nor from heeding Time’s monitions;
      But in cleaving to the Dream,
      And in gazing at the gleam
      Whereby gray things golden seem.

                                    II

   Thus do I this heyday, holding
   Shadows but as lights unfolding,
   As no specious show this moment
   With its irisèd embowment;
      But as nothing other than
      Part of a benignant plan;
      Proof that earth was made for man.

TO LIZBIE BROWNE

   DEAR Lizbie Browne,
   Where are you now?
   In sun, in rain?—
   Or is your brow
   Past joy, past pain,
   Dear Lizbie Browne?

                                    II

   Sweet Lizbie Browne
   How you could smile,
   How you could sing!—
   How archly wile
   In glance-giving,
   Sweet Lizbie Browne!

                                   III

   And, Lizbie Browne,
   Who else had hair
   Bay-red as yours,
   Or flesh so fair
   Bred out of doors,
   Sweet Lizbie Browne?

                                    IV

   When, Lizbie Browne,
   You had just begun
   To be endeared
   By stealth to one,
   You disappeared
   My Lizbie Browne!

                                    V

   Ay, Lizbie Browne,
   So swift your life,
   And mine so slow,
   You were a wife
   Ere I could show
   Love, Lizbie Browne.

                                    VI

   Still, Lizbie Browne,
   You won, they said,
   The best of men
   When you were wed . . .
   Where went you then,
   O Lizbie Browne?

                                   VII

   Dear Lizbie Browne,
   I should have thought,
   “Girls ripen fast,”

   You ere you passed,
   Dear Lizbie Browne!

   Yes, Lizbie Browne!



SONG OF HOPE


   O SWEET To-morrow!—
      After to-day
      There will away
   This sense of sorrow.
   Then let us borrow
   Hope, for a gleaming
   Soon will be streaming,
      Dimmed by no gray—
         No gray!

   While the winds wing us
      Sighs from The Gone,
      Nearer to dawn
   Minute-beats bring us;
   When there will sing us
   Larks of a glory
   Waiting our story
      Further anon—
         Anon!

   Doff the black token,
      Don the red shoon,
      Right and retune
   Viol-strings broken;
   Null the words spoken
   In speeches of rueing,
   The night cloud is hueing,
      To-morrow shines soon—
         Shines soon!



THE WELL-BELOVED


   I wayed by star and planet shine
      Towards the dear one’s home
   At Kingsbere, there to make her mine
      When the next sun upclomb.

   I edged the ancient hill and wood
      Beside the Ikling Way,
   Nigh where the Pagan temple stood
      In the world’s earlier day.

   And as I quick and quicker walked
      On gravel and on green,
   I sang to sky, and tree, or talked
      Of her I called my queen.

   —“O faultless is her dainty form,
      And luminous her mind;
   She is the God-created norm
      Of perfect womankind!”

   A shape whereon one star-blink gleamed
      Glode softly by my side,
   A woman’s; and her motion seemed
      The motion of my bride.

   And yet methought she’d drawn erstwhile
      Adown the ancient leaze,
   Where once were pile and peristyle
      For men’s idolatries.

   —“O maiden lithe and lone, what may
      Thy name and lineage be,
   Who so resemblest by this ray
      My darling?—Art thou she?”

   The Shape: “Thy bride remains within
      Her father’s grange and grove.”
   —“Thou speakest rightly,” I broke in,
      “Thou art not she I love.”

   —“Nay: though thy bride remains inside
      Her father’s walls,” said she,
   “The one most dear is with thee here,
      For thou dost love but me.”

   Then I: “But she, my only choice,
      Is now at Kingsbere Grove?”
   Again her soft mysterious voice:
      “I am thy only Love.”

   Thus still she vouched, and still I said,
      “O sprite, that cannot be!” . . .
   It was as if my bosom bled,
      So much she troubled me.

   The sprite resumed: “Thou hast transferred
      To her dull form awhile
   My beauty, fame, and deed, and word,
      My gestures and my smile.

   “O fatuous man, this truth infer,
      Brides are not what they seem;
   Thou lovest what thou dreamest her;
      I am thy very dream!”

   —“O then,” I answered miserably,
      Speaking as scarce I knew,
   “My loved one, I must wed with thee
      If what thou say’st be true!”

   She, proudly, thinning in the gloom:
      “Though, since troth-plight began,
   I’ve ever stood as bride to groom,
      I wed no mortal man!”

   Thereat she vanished by the Cross
      That, entering Kingsbere town,
   The two long lanes form, near the fosse
      Below the faneless Down.

   —When I arrived and met my bride,
      Her look was pinched and thin,
   As if her soul had shrunk and died,
      And left a waste within.



HER REPROACH


   CON the dead page as ’twere live love: press on!
   Cold wisdom’s words will ease thy track for thee;
   Aye, go; cast off sweet ways, and leave me wan
   To biting blasts that are intent on me.

   But if thy object Fame’s far summits be,
   Whose inclines many a skeleton o’erlies
   That missed both dream and substance, stop and see
   How absence wears these cheeks and dims these eyes!

   It surely is far sweeter and more wise
   To water love, than toil to leave anon
   A name whose glory-gleam will but advise
   Invidious minds to quench it with their own,

   And over which the kindliest will but stay
   A moment, musing, “He, too, had his day!”

THE INCONSISTENT


   I SAY, “She was as good as fair,”
      When standing by her mound;
   “Such passing sweetness,” I declare,
      “No longer treads the ground.”
   I say, “What living Love can catch
      Her bloom and bonhomie,
   And what in newer maidens match
      Her olden warmth to me!”

   —There stands within yon vestry-nook
      Where bonded lovers sign,
   Her name upon a faded book
      With one that is not mine.

      She once had breathed to me,

A BROKEN APPOINTMENT


         YOU did not come,
   And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb.—
   Yet less for loss of your dear presence there
   Than that I thus found lacking in your make
   That high compassion which can overbear
   Reluctance for pure lovingkindness’ sake
   Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum,
         You did not come.

         You love not me,
   And love alone can lend you loyalty;
   —I know and knew it.  But, unto the store
   Of human deeds divine in all but name,
   Was it not worth a little hour or more
   To add yet this: Once, you, a woman, came
   To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be
         You love not me?



“BETWEEN US NOW”


   BETWEEN us now and here—
      Two thrown together

      Life’s flushest feather—
   Who see the scenes slide past,
   The daytimes dimming fast,
   Let there be truth at last,
      Even if despair.

   So thoroughly and long
      Have you now known me,
   So real in faith and strong
      Have I now shown me,
   That nothing needs disguise
   Further in any wise,
   Or asks or justifies
      A guarded tongue.

   Face unto face, then, say,
      Eyes mine own meeting,
   Is your heart far away,
      Or with mine beating?
   When false things are brought low,
   And swift things have grown slow,
   Feigning like froth shall go,
      Faith be for aye.



“HOW GREAT MY GRIEF”
(TRIOLET)


   HOW great my grief, my joys how few,
   Since first it was my fate to know thee!
   —Have the slow years not brought to view
   How great my grief, my joys how few,
   Nor memory shaped old times anew,
      Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee
   How great my grief, my joys how few,

“I NEED NOT GO”


   I NEED not go
   Through sleet and snow
   To where I know
   She waits for me;
   She will wait me there
   Till I find it fair,
   And have time to spare
   From company.

   When I’ve overgot
   The world somewhat,
   When things cost not
   Such stress and strain,
   Is soon enough
   By cypress sough
   To tell my Love
   I am come again.

   And if some day,
   When none cries nay,
   I still delay
   To seek her side,
   (Though ample measure
   Of fitting leisure
   Await my pleasure)
   She will riot chide.

   What—not upbraid me
   That I delayed me,
   Nor ask what stayed me
   So long?  Ah, no!—
   New cares may claim me,
   New loves inflame me,
   She will not blame me,
   But suffer it so.

A SPOT


      IN years defaced and lost,
      Two sat here, transport-tossed,
      Lit by a living love
   The wilted world knew nothing of:
         Scared momently
         By gaingivings,
         Then hoping things
         That could not be.

      Of love and us no trace
      Abides upon the place;
      The sun and shadows wheel,
   Season and season sereward steal;
         Foul days and fair
         Here, too, prevail,
         And gust and gale
         As everywhere.

      But lonely shepherd souls
      Who bask amid these knolls
      May catch a faery sound
   On sleepy noontides from the ground:
         “O not again
         Till Earth outwears
         Shall love like theirs
         Suffuse this glen!”



LONG PLIGHTED


         IS it worth while, dear, now,
   To call for bells, and sally forth arrayed
   For marriage-rites—discussed, decried, delayed
            So many years?

         Is it worth while, dear, now,
   To stir desire for old fond purposings,
   By feints that Time still serves for dallyings,
            Though quittance nears?

         Is it worth while, dear, when
   The day being so far spent, so low the sun,
   The undone thing will soon be as the done,
         And smiles as tears?

         Is it worth while, dear, when
   Our cheeks are worn, our early brown is gray;
   When, meet or part we, none says yea or nay,
         Or heeds, or cares?

         Is it worth while, dear, since
   We still can climb old Yell’ham’s wooded mounds
   Together, as each season steals its rounds
         And disappears?

         Is it worth while, dear, since
   As mates in Mellstock churchyard we can lie,
   Till the last crash of all things low and high
         Shall end the spheres?



THE WIDOW


   BY Mellstock Lodge and Avenue
      Towards her door I went,
   And sunset on her window-panes
      Reflected our intent.

   The creeper on the gable nigh
      Was fired to more than red
   And when I came to halt thereby
      “Bright as my joy!” I said.

   Of late days it had been her aim
      To meet me in the hall;
   Now at my footsteps no one came;
      And no one to my call.

   Again I knocked; and tardily
      An inner step was heard,
   And I was shown her presence then
      With scarce an answering word.

   She met me, and but barely took
      My proffered warm embrace;
   Preoccupation weighed her look,
      And hardened her sweet face.

   “To-morrow—could you—would you call?
      Make brief your present stay?
   My child is ill—my one, my all!—
      And can’t be left to-day.”

   And then she turns, and gives commands
      As I were out of sound,
   Or were no more to her and hers
      Than any neighbour round . . .

   —As maid I wooed her; but one came
      And coaxed her heart away,
   And when in time he wedded her
      I deemed her gone for aye.

   He won, I lost her; and my loss
      I bore I know not how;
   But I do think I suffered then
      Less wretchedness than now.

   For Time, in taking him, had oped
      An unexpected door
   Of bliss for me, which grew to seem
      Far surer than before . . .

   Her word is steadfast, and I know
      That plighted firm are we:
   But she has caught new love-calls since
      She smiled as maid on me!

   IF hours be years the twain are blest,
   For now they solace swift desire

THE DREAM-FOLLOWER


   A DREAM of mine flew over the mead
      To the halls where my old Love reigns;
   And it drew me on to follow its lead:
      And I stood at her window-panes;

   And I saw but a thing of flesh and bone
      Speeding on to its cleft in the clay;
   And my dream was scared, and expired on a moan,
      And I whitely hastened away.

      His fellow-yearsmen passed, and then

         And spectral mannikin.

THE LAST CHRYSANTHEMUM


   WHY should this flower delay so long
      To show its tremulous plumes?
   Now is the time of plaintive robin-song,
      When flowers are in their tombs.

   Through the slow summer, when the sun
      Called to each frond and whorl
   That all he could for flowers was being done,
      Why did it not uncurl?

   It must have felt that fervid call
      Although it took no heed,
   Waking but now, when leaves like corpses fall,
      And saps all retrocede.

   Too late its beauty, lonely thing,
      The season’s shine is spent,
   Nothing remains for it but shivering
      In tempests turbulent.

   Had it a reason for delay,
      Dreaming in witlessness
   That for a bloom so delicately gay
      Winter would stay its stress?

   —I talk as if the thing were born
      With sense to work its mind;
   Yet it is but one mask of many worn
      By the Great Face behind.



THE DARKLING THRUSH


   I LEANT upon a coppice gate
      When Frost was spectre-gray,
   And Winter’s dregs made desolate
      The weakening eye of day.
   The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
      Like strings from broken lyres,
   And all mankind that haunted nigh
      Had sought their household fires.

   The land’s sharp features seemed to be
      The Century’s corpse outleant,
   His crypt the cloudy canopy,
      The wind his death-lament.
   The ancient pulse of germ and birth
      Was shrunken hard and dry,
   And every spirit upon earth
      Seemed fervourless as I.

   At once a voice outburst among
      The bleak twigs overhead
   In a full-hearted evensong
      Of joy illimited;
   An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,
      In blast-beruffled plume,
   Had chosen thus to fling his soul
      Upon the growing gloom.

   So little cause for carollings
      Of such ecstatic sound
   Was written on terrestrial things
      Afar or nigh around,
   That I could think there trembled through
      His happy good-night air
   Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew
      And I was unaware.

MAD JUDY


   WHEN the hamlet hailed a birth
      Judy used to cry:
   When she heard our christening mirth
      She would kneel and sigh.
   She was crazed, we knew, and we
   Humoured her infirmity.

   When the daughters and the sons
      Gathered them to wed,
   And we like-intending ones
      Danced till dawn was red,
   She would rock and mutter, “More
   Comers to this stony shore!”

   When old Headsman Death laid hands
      On a babe or twain,
   She would feast, and by her brands
      Sing her songs again.
   What she liked we let her do,
   Judy was insane, we knew.



A WASTED ILLNESS


         THROUGH vaults of pain,
   Enribbed and wrought with groins of ghastliness,
   I passed, and garish spectres moved my brain
         To dire distress.

         And hammerings,
   And quakes, and shoots, and stifling hotness, blent
   With webby waxing things and waning things
         As on I went.

         “Where lies the end
   To this foul way?” I asked with weakening breath.
   Thereon ahead I saw a door extend—
         The door to death.

         It loomed more clear:
   “At last!” I cried.  “The all-delivering door!”
   And then, I knew not how, it grew less near
         Than theretofore.

         And back slid I
   Along the galleries by which I came,
   And tediously the day returned, and sky,
         And life—the same.

         And all was well:
   Old circumstance resumed its former show,
   And on my head the dews of comfort fell
         As ere my woe.

         I roam anew,
   Scarce conscious of my late distress . . .  And yet
   Those backward steps through pain I cannot view
         Without regret.

         For that dire train
   Of waxing shapes and waning, passed before,
   And those grim aisles, must be traversed again
         To reach that door.

   The stately beauties of its roof and wall
   Passed into sordid hands.  Condemned to fall
         Were cornice, quoin, and cove,

   Among the hired dismantlers entered there
   One till the moment of his task untold.
   When charged therewith he gazed, and answered bold:
         “Be needy I or no,

                                    V

   Dismissed with sneers he backed his tools and went,
   And wandered workless; for it seemed unwise
   To close with one who dared to criticize
         And carp on points of taste:
   To work where they were placed rude men were meant.

   Years whiled.  He aged, sank, sickened, and was not:
   And it was said, “A man intractable
   And curst is gone.”  None sighed to hear his knell,
         None sought his churchyard-place;
   His name, his rugged face, were soon forgot.

   She quickened her feet, and met him where
      They had predesigned:

   Her life with his made the moments there
      Efface the years behind.

   The gaud with his image once had been

   He appealed.  But they parted, weak and wan:

      That they parted for evermore.

   Regaining the Hall she had sworn to leave . . .
   The house was soundless as a tomb,

      Lone, kneeling, in the gloom.

THE MILKMAID


      UNDER a daisied bank
   There stands a rich red ruminating cow,
      And hard against her flank
   A cotton-hooded milkmaid bends her brow.

      The flowery river-ooze
   Upheaves and falls; the milk purrs in the pail;
      Few pilgrims but would choose
   The peace of such a life in such a vale.

      The maid breathes words—to vent,
   It seems, her sense of Nature’s scenery,
      Of whose life, sentiment,
   And essence, very part itself is she.

      She bends a glance of pain,
   And, at a moment, lets escape a tear;
      Is it that passing train,
   Whose alien whirr offends her country ear?—

      Nay!  Phyllis does not dwell
   On visual and familiar things like these;
      What moves her is the spell
   Of inner themes and inner poetries:

      Could but by Sunday morn
   Her gay new gown come, meads might dry to dun,
      Trains shriek till ears were torn,
   If Fred would not prefer that Other One.

   “Yes: that’s how we dress when we’re ruined,” said she.

   —“Your hands were like paws then, your face blue and bleak,
   But now I’m bewitched by your delicate cheek,
   And your little gloves fit as on any la-dy!”—
   “We never do work when we’re ruined,” said she.

   —“You used to call home-life a hag-ridden dream,
   And you’d sigh, and you’d sock; but at present you seem
   To know not of megrims or melancho-ly!”—
   “True.  There’s an advantage in ruin,” said she.

   —“I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping gown,
   And a delicate face, and could strut about Town!”—
   “My dear—a raw country girl, such as you be,
   Isn’t equal to that.  You ain’t ruined,” said she.

   The prophets to its happening sware;
   That David was no giant-slayer,

   In certain details we could spare,
   But rather was a debonair
   Shrewd bandit, skilled as banjo-player:
   That Solomon sang the fleshly Fair,

   And Balaam’s ass’s bitter blare;
   Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace-flare,

THE KING’S EXPERIMENT


      IT was a wet wan hour in spring,
   And Nature met King Doom beside a lane,
   Wherein Hodge trudged, all blithely ballading
         The Mother’s smiling reign.

      “Why warbles he that skies are fair
   And coombs alight,” she cried, “and fallows gay,
   When I have placed no sunshine in the air
         Or glow on earth to-day?”

      “’Tis in the comedy of things
   That such should be,” returned the one of Doom;
   “Charge now the scene with brightest blazonings,
         And he shall call them gloom.”

      She gave the word: the sun outbroke,
   All Froomside shone, the hedgebirds raised a song;
   And later Hodge, upon the midday stroke,
         Returned the lane along,

      Low murmuring: “O this bitter scene,
   And thrice accurst horizon hung with gloom!
   How deadly like this sky, these fields, these treen,
         To trappings of the tomb!”

      The Beldame then: “The fool and blind!
   Such mad perverseness who may apprehend?”—
   “Nay; there’s no madness in it; thou shalt find
         Thy law there,” said her friend.

      “When Hodge went forth ’twas to his Love,
   To make her, ere this eve, his wedded prize,
   And Earth, despite the heaviness above,
         Was bright as Paradise.

      “But I sent on my messenger,
   With cunning arrows poisonous and keen,
   To take forthwith her laughing life from her,
         And dull her little een,

      “And white her cheek, and still her breath,
   Ere her too buoyant Hodge had reached her side;
   So, when he came, he clasped her but in death,
         And never as his bride.

      “And there’s the humour, as I said;
   Thy dreary dawn he saw as gleaming gold,

   One who, past doubtings all,

   Then what is the matter is I, I say.  Why should such an one be here?
   . . .

   Let him to whose ears the low-voiced Best seems stilled by the clash
   of the First,
   Who holds that if way to the Better there be, it exacts a full look at
   the Worst,
   Who feels that delight is a delicate growth cramped by crookedness,
   custom, and fear,
   Get him up and be gone as one shaped awry; he disturbs the order here.

    “Heu mihi, quia incolatus meus prolongatus est!  Habitavi cum
    habitantibus Cedar; multum incola fuit aninia mea.”—_Ps._ cxix.

   THERE have been times when I well might have passed and the ending
   have come—
   Points in my path when the dark might have stolen on me, artless,
   unrueing—
   Ere I had learnt that the world was a welter of futile doing:
   Such had been times when I well might have passed, and the ending have
   come!

   Say, on the noon when the half-sunny hours told that April was nigh,
   And I upgathered and cast forth the snow from the crocus-border,
   Fashioned and furbished the soil into a summer-seeming order,
   Glowing in gladsome faith that I quickened the year thereby.

   Or on that loneliest of eves when afar and benighted we stood,
   She who upheld me and I, in the midmost of Egdon together,
   Confident I in her watching and ward through the blackening heather,
   Deeming her matchless in might and with measureless scope endued.

   Or on that winter-wild night when, reclined by the chimney-nook quoin,
   Slowly a drowse overgat me, the smallest and feeblest of folk there,
   Weak from my baptism of pain; when at times and anon I awoke there—
   Heard of a world wheeling on, with no listing or longing to join.

   Even then! while unweeting that vision could vex or that knowledge
   could numb,
   That sweets to the mouth in the belly are bitter, and tart, and
   untoward,
   Then, on some dim-coloured scene should my briefly raised curtain have
   lowered,
   Then might the Voice that is law have said “Cease!” and the ending
   have come.

THE CHURCH-BUILDER


                                    I

   THE church flings forth a battled shade
      Over the moon-blanched sward;
   The church; my gift; whereto I paid
      My all in hand and hoard:
         Lavished my gains
         With stintless pains
      To glorify the Lord.

                                    II

   I squared the broad foundations in
      Of ashlared masonry;
   I moulded mullions thick and thin,
      Hewed fillet and ogee;
         I circleted
         Each sculptured head
      With nimb and canopy.

                                   III

   I called in many a craftsmaster
      To fix emblazoned glass,
   To figure Cross and Sepulchre
      On dossal, boss, and brass.
         My gold all spent,
         My jewels went
      To gem the cups of Mass.

                                    IV

   I borrowed deep to carve the screen
      And raise the ivoried Rood;
   I parted with my small demesne
      To make my owings good.
         Heir-looms unpriced
         I sacrificed,
      Until debt-free I stood.

                                    V

   So closed the task.  “Deathless the Creed
      Here substanced!” said my soul:
   “I heard me bidden to this deed,
      And straight obeyed the call.
         Illume this fane,
         That not in vain
      I build it, Lord of all!”

                                    VI

   But, as it chanced me, then and there
      Did dire misfortunes burst;
   My home went waste for lack of care,
      My sons rebelled and curst;
         Till I confessed
         That aims the best
      Were looking like the worst.

                                   VII

   Enkindled by my votive work
      No burning faith I find;
   The deeper thinkers sneer and smirk,
      And give my toil no mind;
         From nod and wink
         I read they think
      That I am fool and blind.

                                   VIII

   My gift to God seems futile, quite;
      The world moves as erstwhile;
   And powerful wrong on feeble right
      Tramples in olden style.
         My faith burns down,
         I see no crown;
      But Cares, and Griefs, and Guile.

                                    IX

   So now, the remedy?  Yea, this:
      I gently swing the door
   Here, of my fane—no soul to wis—
      And cross the patterned floor
         To the rood-screen
         That stands between
      The nave and inner chore.

                                    X

   The rich red windows dim the moon,
      But little light need I;
   I mount the prie-dieu, lately hewn
      From woods of rarest dye;
         Then from below
         My garment, so,
      I draw this cord, and tie

                                    XI

   One end thereof around the beam
      Midway ’twixt Cross and truss:
   I noose the nethermost extreme,
      And in ten seconds thus
         I journey hence—
         To that land whence
      No rumour reaches us.

                                   XII

   Well: Here at morn they’ll light on one
      Dangling in mockery
   Of what he spent his substance on
      Blindly and uselessly! . . .
         “He might,” they’ll say,
         “Have built, some way.
      A cheaper gallows-tree!”



THE LOST PYX
A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457}


   SOME say the spot is banned; that the pillar Cross-and-Hand
      Attests to a deed of hell;
   But of else than of bale is the mystic tale
      That ancient Vale-folk tell.

   Ere Cernel’s Abbey ceased hereabout there dwelt a priest,
      (In later life sub-prior
   Of the brotherhood there, whose bones are now bare
      In the field that was Cernel choir).

   One night in his cell at the foot of yon dell
      The priest heard a frequent cry:
   “Go, father, in haste to the cot on the waste,
      And shrive a man waiting to die.”

   Said the priest in a shout to the caller without,
      “The night howls, the tree-trunks bow;
   One may barely by day track so rugged a way,
      And can I then do so now?”

   No further word from the dark was heard,
      And the priest moved never a limb;
   And he slept and dreamed; till a Visage seemed
      To frown from Heaven at him.

   In a sweat he arose; and the storm shrieked shrill,
      And smote as in savage joy;
   While High-Stoy trees twanged to Bubb-Down Hill,
      And Bubb-Down to High-Stoy.

   There seemed not a holy thing in hail,
      Nor shape of light or love,
   From the Abbey north of Blackmore Vale
      To the Abbey south thereof.

   Yet he plodded thence through the dark immense,
      And with many a stumbling stride
   Through copse and briar climbed nigh and nigher
      To the cot and the sick man’s side.

   When he would have unslung the Vessels uphung
      To his arm in the steep ascent,
   He made loud moan: the Pyx was gone
      Of the Blessed Sacrament.

   Then in dolorous dread he beat his head:
      “No earthly prize or pelf
   Is the thing I’ve lost in tempest tossed,
      But the Body of Christ Himself!”

   He thought of the Visage his dream revealed,
      And turned towards whence he came,
   Hands groping the ground along foot-track and field,
      And head in a heat of shame.

   Till here on the hill, betwixt vill and vill,
      He noted a clear straight ray
   Stretching down from the sky to a spot hard by,
      Which shone with the light of day.

   And gathered around the illumined ground
      Were common beasts and rare,
   All kneeling at gaze, and in pause profound
      Attent on an object there.

   ’Twas the Pyx, unharmed ’mid the circling rows
      Of Blackmore’s hairy throng,
   Whereof were oxen, sheep, and does,
      And hares from the brakes among;

   And badgers grey, and conies keen,
      And squirrels of the tree,
   And many a member seldom seen
      Of Nature’s family.

   The ireful winds that scoured and swept
      Through coppice, clump, and dell,
   Within that holy circle slept
      Calm as in hermit’s cell.

   Then the priest bent likewise to the sod
      And thanked the Lord of Love,
   And Blessed Mary, Mother of God,
      And all the saints above.

   And turning straight with his priceless freight,
      He reached the dying one,
   Whose passing sprite had been stayed for the rite
      Without which bliss hath none.

   And when by grace the priest won place,
      And served the Abbey well,
   He reared this stone to mark where shone
      That midnight miracle.



TESS’S LAMENT

            Forgot me quite!
   I would that I could shrink from sight,

   Would it were time to say farewell,
   To claim my nook, to need my knell,
   Time for them all to stand and tell
      Of my day’s work as done.

   Ah! dairy where I lived so long,
            I lived so long;
   Where I would rise up stanch and strong,
      And lie down hopefully.
   ’Twas there within the chimney-seat
   He watched me to the clock’s slow beat—
   Loved me, and learnt to call me sweet,
      And whispered words to me.

                                   III

   And now he’s gone; and now he’s gone; . . .
         And now he’s gone!
   The flowers we potted p’rhaps are thrown
      To rot upon the farm.
   And where we had our supper-fire
   May now grow nettle, dock, and briar,
   And all the place be mould and mire
      So cozy once and warm.

                                    IV

   And it was I who did it all,
            Who did it all;
   ’Twas I who made the blow to fall
      On him who thought no guile.
   Well, it is finished—past, and he
   Has left me to my misery,
   And I must take my Cross on me
      For wronging him awhile.

                                    V

   How gay we looked that day we wed,
         That day we wed!
   “May joy be with ye!” all o’m said
      A standing by the durn.
   I wonder what they say o’s now,
   And if they know my lot; and how
   She feels who milks my favourite cow,
      And takes my place at churn!

                                    VI

   It wears me out to think of it,
         To think of it;
   I cannot bear my fate as writ,
      I’d have my life unbe;
   Would turn my memory to a blot,
   Make every relic of me rot,
   My doings be as they were not,
      And what they’ve brought to me!

   Or star exceptional.
      Into the dim
      Dead throngs around
      He’ll sink, nor sound
      Be left of him.”

   “Yet,” said they, “his frail speech,
   Hath accents pitched like thine—
   Thy mould and his define
   A likeness each to each—
      But go!  Deep pain
      Alas, would be
      His name to thee,
      And told in vain!”

MEMORY AND I


   “O MEMORY, where is now my youth,
   Who used to say that life was truth?”

   “I saw him in a crumbled cot
      Beneath a tottering tree;
   That he as phantom lingers there
      Is only known to me.”

   “O Memory, where is now my joy,
   Who lived with me in sweet employ?”

   “I saw him in gaunt gardens lone,
      Where laughter used to be;
   That he as phantom wanders there
      Is known to none but me.”

   “O Memory, where is now my hope,
   Who charged with deeds my skill and scope?”

   “I saw her in a tomb of tomes,
      Where dreams are wont to be;
   That she as spectre haunteth there
      Is only known to me.”

   “O Memory, where is now my faith,
   One time a champion, now a wraith?”

   “I saw her in a ravaged aisle,
      Bowed down on bended knee;
   That her poor ghost outflickers there
      Is known to none but me.”

   “O Memory, where is now my love,
   That rayed me as a god above?”

   “I saw him by an ageing shape
      Where beauty used to be;
   That his fond phantom lingers there
      Is only known to me.”



ΑΓΝΩΣΤΩ.  ΘΕΩ.


   LONG have I framed weak phantasies of Thee,
      O Willer masked and dumb!
      Who makest Life become,—
   As though by labouring all-unknowingly,
      Like one whom reveries numb.

   How much of consciousness informs Thy will
      Thy biddings, as if blind,
      Of death-inducing kind,
   Nought shows to us ephemeral ones who fill
      But moments in Thy mind.

   Perhaps Thy ancient rote-restricted ways
      Thy ripening rule transcends;
      That listless effort tends
   To grow percipient with advance of days,
      And with percipience mends.

   For, in unwonted purlieus, far and nigh,
      At whiles or short or long,
      May be discerned a wrong
   Dying as of self-slaughter; whereat I
      Would raise my voice in song.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

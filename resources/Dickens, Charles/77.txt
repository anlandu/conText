INTRODUCTORY NOTE


THERE is one question upon which the critics and lovers of Dickens seem
never able to get into agreement, and that is the question of the
original illustrations to his works. To the thorough-going enthusiast
Phiz and Dickens seem inseparable, and no edition which does not contain
the old, familiar grotesques of Hablot Browne's imagination, or, in the
earlier volume, the equally abnormal lineaments portrayed by Cruikshank
or Seymour, would be deemed worthy of a place upon his bookshelf. But a
younger generation is growing up, for whom the time-honoured pictures
have not the charm of long association, and among them it is common to
hear the complaint that the natural humour and pathos of the author's
best works are spoiled to modern fancy by the violent caricatures of the
illustrator. "Let us abolish these pictures altogether," they say: "and
illustrate the books with pretty conventionalities by more fashionable
artists." At the opposite pole stands yet another group of critics--the
"Superior People" who have made up their minds that Dickens himself was
a caricaturist, and that therefore the early illustrations, even if they
do a little emphasise his exaggerations, are only conceived in fitting
harmony with a world of fancy which drowns itself in excesses of the
grotesque. Among so many doctors, and all so emphatic, who shall decide?
It is, at any rate, no easy task.

It happens, however, that there does exist a series of Dickens
illustrations, now in some danger of being unduly neglected, in which
the artists were wonderfully happy in preserving the original features
of Phiz and Cruikshank's interpretations, while they toned down the more
extravagant details and brought imagination into closer harmony with
reality. These were the illustrations to the square-shaped "Household
Edition," published in 1870, just after the great novelist's death--and
now reissued in this Dickens picture-book, in the hope that those who
love the stories may like to possess in separate form what is, perhaps,
the best pictorial accompaniment that the novels ever received. At the
time of its first publication, the "Household Edition" enjoyed an
enormous success. At the moment the name of Dickens was on every one's
lips, and the fact that this splendidly illustrated reprint was issued
in penny numbers and sixpenny parts placed it within reach of even the
most humbly stocked purse. Its sale was stupendous, and the familiar
green-covered pamphlets percolated through every town and village where
the English tongue is spoken. The original copies may still be met with,
under many a country timbered roof, carefully treasured as one of the
most cherished household possessions.

Undoubtedly, a great part of the success was due to the art of the
illustrators. To begin with, there was an unusually liberal display of
pictures--the edition, as a whole, containing close upon nine hundred.
But more important than the number were the truth and sincerity of the
interpretations--qualities which helped to give a new life to characters
already secure of immortality. First and foremost, of course, the
edition will always be associated with the memory of Fred Barnard, whose
pictures are the outstanding feature of the present volume. Barnard
seemed destined by nature to illustrate Dickens; the spirit of "Boz" ran
again in his veins. And nothing in his work is more impressively
ingenious than the skill with which he took the types already created by
his predecessors, preserved their characteristics, so that each was
unmistakably himself, and yet by the illuminating touch of genius
transferred them every one from the realm of caricature to that of
portraiture. Not far inferior to him was that admirable draughtsman,
Charles Green, who exactly adopted Barnard's attitude to the originals.
The reader who will compare Green's illustrations to "The Old Curiosity
Shop" with Phiz's, will scarcely fail to notice with interest how often
Green has chosen the same subject as his predecessor, and all but
treated it in the same manner, save that a twisted grotesque suddenly
becomes, under the magic of his wand, a natural human being. His picture
of Sally Brass and the Marchioness is a remarkable instance in point:
but there are many others equally eloquent of his sympathetic and
interpretative method. Nor should the work of Mahony, A. B. Frost,
Gordon Thomson and others be forgotten, for each in his own way has
helped to make this volume, what its publishers confidently claim it to
be, a collection of Dickens pictures unrivalled for humour, pathos,
character, and interpretative skill. In the certainty that such a
gallery of good work can hardly fail to find appreciators, the volume is
now offered to all lovers of the most widely popular author of the
Victorian Era.

MY DEAR," AND TOOK HER SEAT AT HER SIDE--Book 2, chap. xiv.]

[Illustration: "TO PRESERVE YOUR APPROBATION, MRS. GENERAL," SAID FANNY,

OBSCURITIES--Book 2, chap. xix.]

DOWN INTO A GREENHOUSE BEFORE BREAKFAST. CHARLOTTE (THE NAME OF MY FALSE

LISTENED--Book 2, chap. xxi.]

[Illustration: HE AROSE AND OPENED IT, AND AN AGREEABLE VOICE ACCOSTED
HIM WITH "HOW DO YOU DO, MR. CLENNAM? I HOPE I AM NOT UNWELCOME IN

FERDINAND--Book 2, chap. xxviii.]

BREAST TO KEEP HIM IN HIS CHAIR, AND WITH HER KNEES UPON THE FLOOR AT

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

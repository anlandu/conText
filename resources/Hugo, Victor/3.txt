LA LÉGENDE DES SIÈCLES

BY VICTOR HUGO

EDITED BY G. F. BRIDGE, M.A.



GENERAL PREFACE

Encouraged by the favourable reception accorded to the 'Oxford Modern
French Series,' the Delegates of the Clarendon Press determined, some
time since, to issue a 'Higher Series' of French works intended for
Upper Forms of Public Schools and for University and Private Students,
and have entrusted me with the task of selecting and editing the various
volumes that will be issued in due course.

The titles of the works selected will at once make it clear that this
series is a new departure, and that an attempt is made to provide
annotated editions of books which have hitherto been obtainable only in
the original French texts. That Madame de Staël, Madame de Girardin,
Daniel Stern, Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Flaubert, Gautier are among the
authors whose works have been selected will leave no doubt as to the
literary excellence of the texts included in this series. Works of such
quality, intended only for advanced scholars, could not be annotated in
the way hitherto usual, since those for whom they have been prepared are
familiar with many things and many events of which younger students have
no knowledge. Geographical and mythological notes have therefore been
generally omitted, as also historical events either too well known to
require elucidation or easily found in the ordinary books of reference.

By such omissions a considerable amount of space has been saved which
has allowed of the extension of the texts, and of their equipment with
notes less elementary than usual, and at the same time brighter and
more interesting, whilst great care has been taken to adapt them to the
special character of each volume.

The Introductions are also a novel feature of the present series.
Originally they were to be exclusively written in English, but as it
was desired that they should be as characteristic as possible, and not
merely extracted from reference books, but real studies of the various
authors and their works, it was decided that the editors should write
them in their own native language.

Whenever it has been possible each volume has been adorned with a
portrait of the author at the time he wrote his book.

In conclusion, I wish to repeat here what I have said in the General
Preface to the 'Oxford Modern French Series,' that 'those who speak a
modern language best invariably possess a good literary knowledge of
it.' This has been endorsed by the best teachers in this and other
countries, and is a generally admitted fact. The present series by
providing works of high literary merit will certainly facilitate the
acquisition of the French language--a tongue which perhaps more than any
other offers a variety of literary specimens which, for beauty of style,
depth of sentiment, accuracy and neatness of expression, may be equalled
but not surpassed.

INTRODUCTION


Victor Hugo's conception of the scheme of the series of poems to which
he gave the title of _La Légende des Siècles_ is thus described in
the preface to the first scenes: 'Exprimer l'humanité dans une espèce
d'oeuvre cyclique; la peindre successivement et simultanément sous tous
ses aspects, histoire, fable, philosophie, religion, science, lesquels
se résument en un seul et immense mouvement d'ascension vers la lumière;
faire apparaître, dans une sorte de miroir sombre et clair--que
l'interruption naturelle de travaux terrestres brisera probablement
avant qu'il ait la dimension rêvée par l'auteur--cette grande figure une
et multiple, lugubre et rayonnante, faible et sacrée, L'Homme.' The poet
thus dreamt of a vast epic, of which the central figure should be no
mythical or legendary hero, but Man himself, conceived as struggling
upwards from the darkness of barbarism to the light of a visionary
golden age. Every epoch was to be painted in its dominant
characteristic, every aspect of human thought was to find its fitting
expression. The first series could pretend to no such completeness,
but the poet promised that the gaps should be filled up in succeeding
volumes. It cannot be said that this stupendous design was ever carried
out. The first volumes, which were published in 1859, and from which the
poems contained in this selection are taken, left great spaces vacant
in the ground-plan of the work, and little attempt was made in the
subsequent series, which appeared in 1877 and 1883, to fill up those
spaces. In fact, Hugo has left large tracts of human history untrod. He
has scarcely touched the civilization of the East, he has given us no
adequate picture of ancient Greece. _L'Aide offerte à Majorien_ can
hardly be regarded as a sufficient picture of the wanderings of the
nations, nor _Le Régiment du Baron Madruce_ as an adequate embodiment
of the spirit of the eighteenth century. The Reformation, and, what is
stranger still, the French Revolution, are not handled at all, though
the heroism of the Napoleonic era finds fitting description in _Le
Cimetière d'Eylau_. The truth is that Hugo set himself a task which
was perhaps beyond the power of any single poet to accomplish, and was
certainly one for which he was not altogether well fitted. He did not
possess that capacity for taking a broad and impartial view of history
which was needed in the author of such an epic as he designed. His
strong predilections on the one hand, and his violent antipathies on the
other, swayed his choice of subjects, narrowed his field of vision,
and influenced his manner of presentment. The series cannot therefore
pretend to philosophic completeness. It is a gallery of pictures painted
by a master-hand, and pervaded by a certain spirit of unity, yet devoid
of any strict arrangement, and formed on no carefully maintained
principle. It is a set of cameos, loosely strung upon a thread, a
structure with countless beautiful parts, which do not however cohere
into any symmetrical whole. The poems are cast in many forms; allegory,
narrative, vision, didactic poetry, lyric poetry, all find a place.
There is little history, but much legend, some fiction, and a good deal
of mythology. The series was not designed as a whole. _La Chanson des
Aventuriers de la Mer_ was written in or before 1840, _Le Mariage de
Roland_, _Aymerillot_, and _La Conscience_ in or about 1846, and other
pieces at intervals between 1849 and 1858, the date at which the poet
appears to have begun the task of building these fragments into an epic
structure. Nor is there in these poems any dispassionate attempt to
portray the character of the successive ages in the life of the race.
For Hugo there was no 'émancipation du moi.' The _Légende_ is less a
revelation of history than it is a revelation of the poet. His choice
of themes was dictated less by a careful search after what was most
characteristic of each epoch than by his own strong predilections. He
loved the picturesque, the heroic, the enormous, the barbarous, the
grotesque. Hence _Éviradnus_, _Ratbert_, _Le Mariage de Roland_. He
loved also the weak, the poor, the defenceless, the old man and the
little child. Hence _Les Pauvres Gens_, _Booz endormi_, _Petit Paul_. He
delighted in the monstrous, he revelled in extremes, and he had little
perception of the lights and shades which make up ordinary human
character. Neither his poems nor his romances show much trace of that
psychological analysis which is the peculiar feature of so much modern
literature. Child of the nineteenth century, as he was in so many
respects, in many of the features of his art he belongs to no era, and
conforms to no tendency, except that of his own Titanic genius. He could
see white and he could see black, but he could not see grey, and never
tried to paint it. He does not allow Philip II even his redeeming
virtues of indefatigable industry and unceasing devotion to duty, while
in his Rome of the decadence would assuredly be found scarce five good
men. His vision is curiously limited to the darker side of history; he
hears humanity uttering in all ages a cry of suffering, and but rarely
a shout of laughter. He sees the oppression of the tyrant more vividly
than the heroism of the oppressed. Has he to write of the power of
Spain? It is in the portrayal of the tyrant of Spain rather than the men
who overcame Spain that his genius finds scope. Does he wish to paint
the era of religious persecution? It is the horror of the Inquisition
rather than the heroism of its victims that is pictured on his canvas.
Delineations of heroic virtue there are indeed in the _Légende_, but it
is noteworthy that they occur usually in fictions such as _Éviradnus_,
_Le Petit Roi de Galice_, and _La Confiance du Marquis Fabrice._[1] He
has given us no historical portraits of noble characters which can be
put side by side with those of Philip II and Sultan Mourad. As in his
dramas, his kings and rulers are always drawn in dark colours. His
heroes belong to the classes that he loved, poor people, common
soldiers, old men, children, and, be it added, animals. He is always the
man of great heart and strong prejudices, never the dramatist or the
philosopher.

[Footnote 1: It is interesting to observe how frequently his heroes are
old men, as Éviradnus, Booz, Fabrice.]

Hugo himself says sadly in his Preface, 'Les tableaux riants sont
rares dans ce livre; cela tient à ce qu'ils ne sont pas fréquents
dans l'histoire,' but in truth the tinge of gloom which lies upon the
_Légende_ is rather the impress upon the volume of history of the poet's
own puissant individuality. He was no scientist and no _savant_, he
had none of that spirit of imperturbable calm with which Shakespeare
surveyed all mankind, none of that impartial sympathy with which
Browning investigated the psychology of saints and sinners alike. He
loved deeply and he hated fiercely, and his poetry was the voice of his
love and his hate. The intensity of his own poetic vision made the past
stand before him as clearly as the present; the note of personal feeling
is as clear and strong in _Sultan Mourad_ and _Bivar_ as in _Les
Châtiments_ or _Le Retour de l'Empereur_. His great qualities of heart
and mind and his singular defects are written large upon every page of
the _Légende_. His passionate hatred of injustice and his passionate
love of liberty, his reverence for the virtues of the home, and
especially for filial obedience and respect, his love for little
children, his antagonism to war and his admiration for what is great
in war which was ever struggling with that antagonism, his patriotic
feeling for the triumphs of the Napoleonic era, to him the heroic age of
French history, his exaggerated belief in the wickedness of kings and
the innocence of poor people, the exaltation of pity into the greatest
of all virtues--these and many other characteristic traits find ample
illustration in his legend of the centuries. It is ever Hugo that is
speaking to us, however many be the masks that he wears.

Yet it would be a mistake to suppose that no general conception of the
history and destiny of mankind is to be found in the work, or that the
author had no sense of an increasing purpose running through the ages.
The conception is no doubt that of a poet and a seer, not of a historian
or a philosopher, but it is clear and vivid, and is expressed with
Titanic force. Hugo pictured the history of mankind as a long struggle
upwards towards the light. Man has in all ages been oppressed by many
evils--by war, by tyranny, by materiality, by mental and moral darkness.
He has sinned greatly, he has suffered greatly; he has been burdened
with toil and surrounded by shadow, tormented by his rulers and misled
by his priests. Paganism was merely material; Rome was strong, cruel,
and repressive; 'a winding-sheet of the nations,' he calls her in
_Changement d'Horizon_[2]; Judaism, his view of which must be sought
rather in _Dieu_ than in the _Légende_, cold and harsh, could influence
man only by keeping him within the strait-waistcoat of a narrow law; the
life of the founder of Christianity was only a momentary gleam of light
in the darkness; the Middle Age was a confused turmoil of rude heroism
and cunning savagery; the Renaissance a relapse into heathenism and
the worship of nature. Yet with the modern ages comes a rift in the
blackness; the poets reveal a new spirit; their songs are the songs of
peace and not of war:

  Le poète à la mort dit: Meurs, guerre, ombre, Envie!--
  Et chasse doucement les hommes vers la vie;
  Et l'on voit de ses vers, goutte à goutte, des pleurs
  Tomber sur les enfants, les femmes et les fleurs;
  Et des astres jaillir de ses strophes volantes;
  Et son chant fait pousser des bourgeons verts aux plantes;
  Et ses rêves sont faits d'aurore, et dans l'amour,
  Sa bouche chante et rit, toute pleine de jour.
                                   (_Changement d'Horizon_.)

[Footnote 2: For a fuller development of this view see _La Fin de Satan:
Le Gibet_, I, i.]

Gentleness and humanity are the characteristic virtues of the later age.
It is a mistake to suppose, as some have done, that such pieces as _Le
Crapaud_, _Après la Bataille_, and _Les Pauvres Gens_ have no connexion
with any epoch. In Hugo's view, that tenderness for the weak and the
defenceless which is their keynote was the peculiar mark of the age in
which he lived, and a foretaste of the glory that was to come. For the
great purpose which his reading of human history reveals to him is
the increase of the love of man to man, the widening of the bounds of
liberty, the growth of brotherly feeling. Suffering and oppression
behind, freedom and joy in front, so does Hugo's imagination picture
world-history, and his love of violent antitheses made him paint the
past in the darkest colours in order that his vision of the future might
shine with the greater radiance. Troubled as he was, no doubt, by the
sombre events of 1850-1, and by the slow progress that the principles
of peace seemed to be making in the world, yet the inspiration of that
vision was never lost, and in the apocalyptic vision of the poem _Plein
Ciel_ he gave superb lyrical expression to the thought that man will
find his heaven, not above the clouds, but in a regenerated earth,
penetrated with the spirit of light and love.

This underlying conception was expressed again in the poem entitled _La
Vision d'où est sorti ce livre_, which was written at Guernsey in 1857,
but published only in 1877. In this vision the history of man appears to
the poet in the form of a gigantic wall, on which are seen the crimes
and sufferings of all the ages. Two spirits pass by, the spirit of Fate
(_Fatalité_), which is the enemy of man, and the spirit of God (Dieu),
which is the friend of man. This wall is shivered into fragments, by
which the seer understands the destruction of pain and evil, and the
closing of the long volume of human history. That volume, the end of
which the dreamer foresees, the poet proposes to write:

  Ce livre, c'est le reste effrayant de Babel;
  C'est la lugubre Tour des Choses, l'édifice
  Du bien, du mal, des pleurs, des deuils, des sacrifices,
  Fier jadis, dominant les lointains horizons,
  Aujourd'hui n'ayant plus que de hideux tronçons
  Épars, couchés, perdus dans l'obscure vallée;
  C'est l'épopée humaine, âpre, immense--écroulée.

The poet's view of the problem of evil and the destiny of humanity
becomes clearer if the _Légende_ is read in connexion with the two poems
mentioned in the Preface to the volume of 1859, as designed to form
with it an immense trilogy: _Dieu_ and _La Fin de Satan_. Neither was
published till after the poet's death, and the latter was left in an
unfinished condition. But they were both planned in the days when,
isolated on his rock and severed from active life, the poet meditated on
the deep questions of life and death. They were meant to be, the one the
prelude, and the other the sequel of his poem of humanity. The leading
thought of _Dieu_ is the falseness of all the positive systems of
religion which have burdened or inspired humanity, and the truth that

  'Dieu n'a qu'un front: Lumière; et n'a qu'un nom: Amour,'

though it is only death which will fully reveal that light.

The theme of _La Fin de Satan_ is the final reconciliation of good and
evil. As Satan falls from heaven, a feather drops from his wing, and
from that feather the Almighty creates the angel Liberty, who is thus
the child equally of the spirit of Good and the spirit of Evil; that
angel finally brings about the pardon of Satan, when the demon finds
that it is impossible for him to live without the presence of the
Almighty. Man is endowed with liberty, this child of good and ill, and
his spirit hovers therefore ever between the exalted and the mean. So
humanity appears to the seer in _Dieu_:

  Et je vis apparaître une étrange figure;
  Un être tout semé de bouches, d'ailes, d'yeux,
  Vivant, presque lugubre et presque radieux;
  Vaste, il volait; plusieurs des ailes étaient chauves.
  En s'agitant, les cils de ses prunelles fauves
  Jetaient plus de rumeur qu'une troupe d'oiseaux,
  Et ses plumes faisaient un bruit de grandes eaux.
  Cauchemar de la chair ou vision d'apôtre,
  Selon qu'il se montrait d'une face ou de l'autre,
  Il semblait une bête ou semblait un esprit.
  Il paraissait, dans l'air où mon vol le surprit,
  Faire de la lumière, et faire des ténèbres.

To Hugo, therefore, evil is not an equal force with good, nor is it
eternal. It was created in time, it will end in time. It is a mistake to
suppose that he accepted any kind of Manichaeism as his solution of the
problem of the universe. In reality his thought is much more permeated
with Christian feeling than with Manichaeism. Though he rejected
dogmatic Catholicism, and indeed assailed it with Voltairian mockery,
yet his vision of the Eternal as the embodiment of that mercy and
goodness which is greater than justice is in its essence a Christian
conception. Inspired, in part at least, by Christian thought seems also
to be his conception of the eventual reconciliation of good and evil,
and that belief in the restoration of all things which finds expression
in the concluding lines of _L'Âne_:

  Dieu ne veut pas que rien, même l'obscurité,
  Même l'Erreur qui semble ou funeste ou futile,
  Que rien puisse, en criant: Quoi, j'étais inutile!
  Dans le gouffre à jamais retomber éperdu;
  Et le lien sacré du service rendu,
  A travers l'ombre affreuse et la céleste sphère,
  Joint l'échelon de nuit aux marches de lumière.

Hope is indeed the keynote of Hugo's poetry. In the darkest days
of 1871, when France was tearing out her own vitals and Paris was
destroying itself, he could write thus:

  Les récits montrent l'un après l'autre leurs têtes,
  Car les évènements ont leur cap des Tempêtes,
  Derrière est la clarté. Ces flux et ces reflux,
  Ces recommencements, ces combats sont voulus,
  Au-dessus de la haine immense, quelqu'un aime.
  Ayons foi. Ce n'est pas sans quelque but suprême
  Que sans cesse, en ce gouffre où rêvent les sondeurs,
  Un prodigieux vent soufflant des profondeurs,
  A travers l'âpre nuit, pousse, emporte et ramène
  Sur tout l'écueil divin toute la mer humaine.
                                (_L'Année Terrible._)

See too the beautiful lines written when to public disaster was added
private grief for the loss of his son Charles, especially the passage,
too long to quote here, in _L'Enterrement_, beginning 'Quand le jeune
lutteur....'

If, passing from the underlying conception to the actual material of the
_Légende_, we ask to what extent the poems can be regarded as history,
the answer must be that they are not history at all in the ordinary
sense of the word. In his _Préface_ Hugo remarks: 'C'est l'aspect
légendaire qui prévaut dans ces deux volumes.' As a matter of fact,
there is not a single poem in any of the series which is a narrative
based upon actual fact. Of the pieces in the present volume, _Le Mariage
de Roland, Aymerillot_, and _Bivar_ are founded on legends. _Éviradnus_
and _La Confiance du Marquis Fabrice_ are inventions, and the others are
mostly embroideries woven upon ancient themes rather than historical or
even legendary pictures. These latter, of which _La Conscience_ is the
best instance in this volume, suggest De Vigny's conception: 'Une pensée
philosophique, mise en scène sous une forme épique ou dramatique.' Of
accuracy in detail and local colour, Hugo was utterly careless. He
possessed a capacious, but not an exact, memory, and, provided the
general impression produced by a description was the true one, he did
not stop to inquire whether every detail was correct. Nor did he always
enjoy an extensive knowledge of the epoch which he delineated. But he
possessed to the full the poet's faculty of building the whole form and
feature of a past age out of a few stray fragments of information. The
historical colour of _Ruy Blas_ is said to be based on two French books,
carelessly consulted, yet of _Ruy Blas_ M. Paul de Saint-Victor, after
making a close study of the period, wrote: 'Ce fragment de siècle que
je venais d'exhumer de tant de recherches, je le retrouvais, vivant et
mouvant, dans l'harmonie d'un drame admirable. Le souffle d'un grand
poète ressuscitait subitement l'ossuaire des faits et des choses que
j'avais péniblement rajusté.'[3]

[Footnote 3: Quoted in Eugène Rigal's _Victor Hugo, poète épique_.]

Moreover, inaccurate as Hugo often is, it is never the inaccuracy that
falsifies. He has been severely criticized for having in _Au Lion
d'Androclès_ assigned to a single epoch events and personages which are
really separated by centuries. But all the facts are typical of the
spirit which dominated Imperial Rome, and combine therefore to form a
description which has poetic and imaginative, if not historical, truth.
And if, with greater licence, he has accumulated upon the head of a
single Mourad all the crimes of a long line of Sultans it is because in
drawing Mourad he is drawing the Turkish nation. Mourad is to him the
typical Turk, the embodiment of Oriental cruelty and lust. If again, to
pass to a larger subject, he has chosen legend rather than history as
the basis of many of his poems, it is not only because of his own innate
love of the marvellous and romantic, but because he cared for the truth
embodied in legend more than the truth embodied in chronicle. If he
mingled fiction with his history, it was because he conceived of the
fiction as being as true a representation of the facts of an era as
annals and records. It may be true that Hugo made imagination do duty
for study, but it is also true that an imagination, such as Hugo's, may
be as sure an instrument as study in reconstructing the past. He may
have mistaken the date of Crassus by several centuries, but readers of
Suetonius will hardly deny the faithfulness of his delineation of at
least one side of the civilization of ancient Rome; he may have invented
a Spanish princess, but his carefully stippled portrait of Philip II
is true to the life, even if it be Philip in his darkest moods. His
inaccuracies are in truth of small account. Who that reads _Le Cimetière
d'Eylau_ cares whether there was a place of burial in the battlefield or
not? or what lover of _Booz endormi_ seeks to know how closely the flora
of Palestine has been studied? A more serious criticism than the charge
of inaccuracy is that of partial vision, and from this Hugo cannot be
entirely exculpated. He saw with his heart, and seeing with the heart
must always mean partial vision. For at the root of Hugo's nature lay an
immense pity, pity not merely for the suffering, but for what is base
or criminal, or what is ugly or degraded. It was this pity which is the
keynote of _Notre-Dame de Paris_ and _Les Misérables_; it is this pity
which inspired much of the _Légende des Siècles_.

The defence of the weak by the strong is one of his constant themes, as
witness _Éviradnus_, _Le Petit Roi de Galice_, _Les Pauvres Gens._ The
contrast of the weak and the strong is one of his favourite artistic
effects, as witness _Booz endormi_, _La Confiance du Marquis Falrice._
An act of pity redeemed Sultan Mourad, an act of pity made the poor ass
greater than all the philosophers. It was this absorbing pity for
the defenceless that made Hugo so merciless to the oppressor and so
incapable of seeing anything but the deepest black in the picture of
the tyrant. One-sided the poet may be, but it is the one-sidedness of a
generous nature; he may err, but his errors at least lean to the side of
virtue.

It would be impossible in the brief space of an introduction such as
this to discuss at any length the characteristics of Hugo as a literary
artist, but a few remarks may be made on some of the features of his art
which are most conspicuous in the poems selected for this volume. It is
scarcely necessary to dwell upon the poet's extraordinary fecundity of
words and images. Occasionally, especially in his later works, this
degenerates into diffuseness, and he exhibits a tendency to repetition
and a fondness for long enumeration of names and details. On the other
hand, he constantly shows how well he understood the power of brevity
and compression. There is not a superfluous word nor a poetic image in
_La Conscience_, the severe and simple style of which is well suited
to the sternness of the subject. The story of _Après la Bataille_ is
related with telling conciseness, while in the highly finished work of
_Booz endormi_ there are no redundant phrases. The many variations on
the same theme in _Aymerillot_ may be criticized as tedious, but there
underlies them the artistic purpose of intensifying the reader's sense
of the cowardice of the nobles by an accumulation of examples. A like
criticism and a like defence may be made of the long list of the crimes
of Sultan Mourad, though here perhaps the poet's torrent of facts goes
beyond the point at which the amassing of details is effective. On the
other hand, the swiftness of the narrative of the _Mariage de Roland_,
and the soldierly brevity of the _Cimetière d'Eylau_, a piece not
included in this volume, are alike admirable, and show Hugo at his best
as a story-teller.

One of the most marked features of Hugo's poetry is his custom of
attributing human desires and volition to inanimate objects. To Hugo,
the whole universe seemed to be alive, both as a whole and in each of
its separate parts, and his way of humanizing the inanimate is not
so much a conscious literary artifice as the natural habit of his
imagination. The tendency is not confined to his poetry; readers of his
romances will remember the gargoyles of Notre-Dame and the cannon
which got loose in the hold of the _Claymore_ and became 'une bête
surnaturelle.' But the instances in his romantic poetry are naturally
more numerous and more vivid. The swords of the heroes are always alive;
in the duel between Roland and Olivier:

  Durandal heurte et suit Closamont.

In the combat between Roland and his enemies in the _Petit Roi de
Galice_, the hero staggers and Froïla leaps forward to crush him:

  Mais Durandal se dresse et jette Froïla
  Sur Pacheco, dont l'âme en ce moment hurla.

The statues in the hall at Final are moved at the gentle tread of
Fabrice and his little ward, and seem to bow to them as they pass.

  Chaque statue, émue à leur pas doux et sombre,
  Vibre, et toutes ont l'air de saluer dans l'ombre,
  Les héros le vieillard, et les anges l'enfant.

But the most striking instance of this tendency occurs in _Éviradnus_,
where, from beginning to end, all that surrounds the actors in the
story lives with a passionate life. The trees that overhear the plot of
Sigismond and Ladislas tremble and moan, and the words that issue from
the lips of the miscreants are dark with shadow or red with blood. The
half-ruined castle of Corbus fights with the winter, like a strong man
with his enemies; the gargoyles on its towers bark at the winds, the
graven monsters on the ramparts snarl and snort, the sculptured lions
claw and bite the wind and rain[4]. In the gloomy halls the griffins
seize with their teeth the great beams of the roofs, and the door is
afraid of the noise of its own opening. The very shadows feel fear and
the pillars are chilled with terror. The armour of the horses and the
men is terribly alive, and charger and knight make but one monster,
clothed in scales of steel.

[Footnote 4: With this picture in verse of the fight between the castle
and the storm should be compared the prose picture of the fight between
the fire and the water in _Le Rhin_ (Lettre xix).]

Hugo loves especially to endow with life objects that suggest a
struggle. It is the wrecked and broken ship of _Pleine Mer_ rather than
the triumphant vessel of _Plein Ciel_ that is animate.


  Ce Titan se rua, joyeux, dans la tempête;
         *       *       *       *       *
  Quand il marchait, fumant, grondant, couvert de toile,
  Il jetait un tel râle â l'air épouvanté
  Que toute l'eau tremblait.
         *       *       *       *       *
  Et pour l'âme il avait dans sa cale un enfer.


Allied with this habit of vivifying the inanimate is the more subtle
artifice of transfiguring or magnifying concrete objects, so that they
become symbolic without ceasing to be real. This blending of the actual
and the figurative is seen in the description of the King and Emperor in
_Éviradnus:_

  Leurs deux figures sont lugubrement grandies
  Par de rouges reflets de sacs et d'incendies.
  *       *       *       *       *
  Leurs ongles monstrueux, crispés sur des rapines,
  Égratignent le pâle et triste continent.

In _La Confiance du Marquis Fabrice_ the reality of the wine and the
suggestion of the blood are very artfully mingled

  Quelque chose de rouge entre les dalles fume,
  Mais, si tiède que soit cette douteuse écume,
  Assez de barils sont éventrés et crevés
  Pour que ce soit du vin qui court les pavés.

Another remarkable feature of Hugo's literary art is the feeling for
light and shade which it displays. He likes to wrap his poems in a
physical atmosphere of brightness or gloom, corresponding to the
sentiment which pervades them. How, for instance, in _Les Orientales_,
that exquisite little gem, _Sarah la Baigneuse_, flashes and sparkles
with light! How striking in _La Fin de Satan_ is the contrast between
the murky atmosphere in which the maker of crosses works and the bright
sunshine in which Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem is bathed!
With what consummate art the darkness of the Crucifixion is made to
accentuate the horror of the event!

  L'ombre immense avait l'air d'une accusation;
  Le monde était couvert d'une nuit infamante;
  C'était l'accablement plus noir que la tourmente,
  La morne extinction de l'haleine et du bruit.

Contrast the radiance of the dawn in which the Satyr, the emblem of
strong and joyous Nature, is first seen:

  C'était l'heure où sortaient les chevaux du soleil;
  Le ciel tout frémissant du glorieux réveil,
  Ouvrant les deux battants de sa porte sonore,
  Blancs, ils apparaissaient formidables d'aurore;
  Derrière eux, comme un orbe effrayant, couvert d'yeux,
  Éclatait la rondeur du char radieux
  *       *       *       *       *
  Les quatre ardents chevaux dressaient leur poitrail d'or;
  Faisant leurs premiers pas, ils se cabraient encor
  Entre la zone obscure et la zone enflammée;
  De leurs crins, d'où semblait sortir une fumée
  De perles, de saphirs, d'onyx, de diamants,
  Dispersée et fuyante au fond des éléments,
  Les trois premiers, l'oeil fier, la narine embrasée,
  Secouaient dans le jour des gouttes de rosée;
  Le dernier secouait des astres dans la nuit.

In _La Confiance du Marquis Fabrice_ light and shadow are very skilfully
managed. We see the little princess Isora making her toilet in the early
morning, when everything is fresh and bright. It is in the dawn that she
loves to play. But the banquet of death takes place at night in a dimly
lighted hall, when the lack of clear light adds to the horror of the
scene. Note the Rembrandtesque effects in such phrases: 'aux tremblantes
clartés,' 'l'ombre indistincte,' 'à travers l'ombre, on voit toutes les
soifs infâmes,' and it ends in 'le triomphe de l'ombre,' a phrase in
which the literal and the figurative are subtly blended together. On
the other hand, how everything sparkles and gleams in _Le Mariage de
Roland_! Olivier's sword-point glitters like the eye of a demon, while
Durandal shines as he falls on his foeman's head; the sunshine is all
round them in the day, and the night passes quickly; sparks fly from the
weapons as they strike one another, and light up the very shadows with
a dull flash. Take again _La Rose de l'Infante_. Everything round the
little princess is bright: 'le profond jardin rayonnant et fleuri,' 'un
grand palais comme au fond d'une gloire,' 'de clairs viviers,' 'des
paons étoilés.' The very grass, too, seems to sparkle with diamonds and
rubies. But Philip is a dark shadow, half hidden in mist:

  On voit d'en bas une ombre, au fond d'une vapeur,
  De fenêtre à fenêtre errer, et l'on a peur.

He is always dressed in black:

  Toujours vêtu de noir, ce tout-puissant terrestre
  Avait l'air d'être en deuil de ce qu'il existait.

No light is ever seen in his palaces:

  L'Escurial, Burgos, Aranjuez, ses repaires,
  Jamais n'illuminaient leurs livides plafonds.

His eye shines, it is true, but it is a gleam that suggests a darkness
beneath:

  Sa prunelle
  Luit comme un soupirail de caverne.

Note again the oppressive darkness of the opening lines of _Pleine Mer_,
in which the only touch of light is the winding-sheet of the waves, and
contrast it with the atmosphere of light which surrounds the ship in
_Plein Ciel_, where even the night is bright:

  La Nuit tire du fond des gouffres inconnus
  Son filet où luit Mars, où rayonne Vénus.

_Le Crapaud_ is wrapped in the light of sunset:

  Le couchant rayonnait dans les nuages roses;
  C'était la fin d'un jour d'orage, et l'occident
  Changeait l'ondée en flamme en son brasier ardent.
         *       *       *       *       *
  Les feuilles s'empourpraient dans les arbres vermeils;
  L'eau miroitait, mêlée à l'herbe, dans l'ornière.

And this because sunset is the hour for gentle thoughts and quiet
feeling:

  Dans la sérénité du pâle crépuscule,
  La brute par moments pense et sent qu'elle est soeur
  De la mystérieuse et profonde douceur.

So strong is Hugo's feeling for light and shadow that he often seems to
solidify them, as it were, into concrete objects. When the trap-door in
the hall of Corbus is opened

  Il en sort de l'ombre, ayant l'odeur du crime,

and in the pit are seen

  D'ombres tâtant le mur et de spectres reptiles.

In _Les Pauvres Gens_

  La morte écoute l'ombre avec stupidité.

In _Fabrice_

  L'aïeul semble d'ombre et de pierre construit.

The light seems solid in this line from _Le Satyre_:

  Son pied fourchu faisait des trous dans la lumière.

Again, in _La Conscience_, shadow is vast and oppressive:

  L'ombre des tours faisait la nuit dans les campagnes.

And in _Au Lion d'Androclès_ it is the fitting emblem of the human race
in a degenerate age:

  La créature humaine, importune au ciel bleu,
  Faisait une ombre affreuse à la cloison de Dieu.

Very curious is the connexion between the legends of a countryside and
the smoke of its cottages in the lines:

  Les légendes toujours mêlent quelque fantôme
  A l'obscure vapeur qui sort des toits de chaume,
  L'âtre enfante le rêve, et l'on voit ondoyer
  L'effroi dans la fumée errante du foyer. (_Éviradnus_.)

Of the infinite variety of Hugo's poetic gifts such a selection as is
contained in this volume can of course give but a very inadequate
idea. The extraordinary versatility and fecundity of his genius can be
appreciated only by those who have read all, or at least much, of his
output. But the first series of the _Légende_ is perhaps that part of
the poet's work in which substance and beauty, original thought and
vivid expression, are found in the most perfect combination. Written in
middle life, it stands midway between his earlier poetry with its more
lyric note and his later work with its deeper and more prophetic tones.
In point of expression the poet's powers had attained their full
development; he has perfect command of rime; the versification is free
and shows no trace of the stilted style of his first volumes; the
language is copious and eloquent, but exhibits few signs of that
verbosity and tendency to vain repetition which, as has been already
remarked, marred some of his later poetry. In the _Légende_, no
doubt, are a thousand extravagances, _bizarreries_, anachronisms, and
negligences. But the greatest poet is not, like the greatest general, he
who makes fewest mistakes, but he who expresses the noblest and truest
feeling in the noblest and truest language. So judged, the _Légende_
will take its place amongst the best that the nineteenth century
produced in poetry.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH


Victor-Marie Hugo, son of an officer in Napoleon's army, was born
at Besançon on February 26, 1802. He spent a roving and unsettled
childhood, for wherever the father was sent the mother and children
followed. The first three years of his life were spent in Elba, where he
learnt to speak the Italian dialect spoken in the island in addition
to his mother tongue. Then for three years the family was in Paris and
Victor got a little education in a small school. But in 1805 the father
was appointed to a post in the army of Naples, and in the autumn of 1807
his wife and children joined him at Avellino. Two years later General
Hugo was invited by Joseph Bonaparte to fill an important position in
the kingdom of Spain, and, desirous that his sons should receive a good
education, he sent his family to Paris, where his wife chose for their
home the house in the Rue des Feuillantines which has been so
charmingly described by the poet in the lines _Ce qui se passait aux
Feuillantines_. There he learnt much from an old soldier, General
Lahorie, who, obnoxious to Napoleon for the share he had taken in
Moreau's plot, lived secretly in the house, and from an old priest named
Larivière, who came every day to teach the three brothers. There too
he played in the garden with the little Adèle Foucher, who afterwards
became his wife. But this quiet home life did not last long. In 1811
Madame Hugo set off to join her husband at Madrid, and the boys went
with her. At Madrid they were sent to a school kept by Priests where
Victor was not very happy, and from which he got small profit. Next year
the whole family returned to Paris, and in 1815, at the age of thirteen,
he was definitely sent to a boarding-school to prepare for the École
Polytechnique. But his was a precocious genius, and he devoted himself,
even at school, to verse-writing with greater ardour than to study.
He wrote in early youth more than one poem for a prize competition,
composed a romance which some years later he elaborated into the story
_Bug-Jargal_, and in 1820, when only eighteen, joined his two
brothers, Abel and Eugène, in publishing a literary journal called _Le
Conservateur Littéraire_. About the same time he became engaged to
Adèle Foucher, and wrote for her the romance of _Han d'Islande_, which,
however, was not published till later. In 1822 he and Adèle were
married, and in the same year he published his first volume of _Odes_.
He was now fully launched on a literary career, and for twenty years or
more the story of his life is mainly the story of his literary output.
In 1827 he published his drama of _Cromwell_, the preface to which, with
its note of defiance to literary convention, caused him to be definitely
accepted as the head of the Romantic School of poetry. _Les Orientales_,
_Le dernier jour d'un condamné_, _Marion de Lorme_, and _Hernani_
followed in quick succession. The revolution of 1830 disturbed for a
moment his literary activity, but as soon as things were quiet again he
shut himself in his study with a bottle of ink, a pen, and an immense
pile of paper. For six weeks he was never seen, except at dinner-time,
and the result was _Notre-Dame de Paris_. During the next ten years
four volumes of poetry and four dramas were published; in 1841 came his
election to the Academy, and in 1843 he published _Les Burgraves_, a
drama which was less successful than his former plays, and which marks
the close of his career as a dramatist. In the same year there came to
him the greatest sorrow of his life. His daughter Léopoldine, to whom
he was deeply attached, was drowned with her husband during a pleasure
excursion on the Seine only a few months after their marriage.

In 1845 Hugo began to take an active part in politics. Son of a Vendean
mother, he had been in early life a fervent royalist, and even in 1830
he could write of the fallen royal family with respectful sympathy. Yet
by that time his democratic leanings had declared themselves, and he
accepted the constitutional monarchy of Louis Philippe only as a step
towards a republic, for which he considered France was not yet ripe. In
1845 the king made him a peer of France, but this did not prevent
him from throwing himself with all the ardour of his nature into the
revolution of 1848. Divining the ambition of Louis Napoleon, he resisted
his growing power, and when the Second Empire was established the poet
was among the first who were exiled from France. He took refuge first in
Jersey, and afterwards in Guernsey, where he lived in a house near the
coast, from the upper balcony of which the cliffs of Normandy could
sometimes be discerned. Thence he launched against the usurper a bitter
prose satire, _Napoléon le Petit_, and a still bitterer satire in verse,
_Les Châtiments_, and there he wrote two of his greatest novels, _Les
Travailleurs de la Mer_ and _Les Misérables_, two of his finest volumes
of poetry, _Les Contemplations_, the greater part of the first series of
_La Légende des Siècles_, and the two remarkable religious poems, _Dieu_
and _La Fin de Satan_. He returned to France on the fall of Napoleon in
1870, to be for fifteen years the idol of the people, who regarded him
as the incarnation of the spirit of liberty. Several volumes of poetry
were issued during those fifteen years, notably _L'Année Terrible_,
_Les Quatre Vents de l'Esprit_, and a second series of _La Légende des
Siècles_, none perhaps equal as a whole to the best of his earlier
volumes, but all, especially the second-named, abounding in beautiful
and striking poetry. He died in 1885, and was buried in a manner
befitting one who had filled Europe with his fame, and had been for so
many years the 'stormy voice of France.'




PRÉFACE
DE LA PREMIÈRE SÉRIE

                           _Hauteville-House, Septembre 1857,_


Les personnes qui voudront bien jeter un coup d'oeil sur ce livre ne
s'en feraient pas une idée précise, si elles y voyaient autre chose
qu'un commencement.

Ce livre est-il donc un fragment? Non. Il existe à part. Il a, comme on
le verra, son exposition, son milieu et sa fin.

Mais, en même temps, il est, pour ainsi dire, la première page d'un
autre livre.

Un commencement peut-il être un tout? Sans doute. Un péristyle est un
édifice.

L'arbre, commencement de la forêt, est un tout. Il appartient à la vie
isolée, par la racine, et à la vie en commun, par la sève. A lui seul,
il ne prouve que l'arbre, mais il annonce la forêt.

Ce livre, s'il n'y avait pas quelque affectation dans des comparaisons
de cette nature, aurait, lui aussi, ce double caractère. Il existe
solitairement et forme un tout; il existe solidairement et fait partie
d'un ensemble.

Cet ensemble, que sera-t-il?

Exprimer l'humanité dans une espèce d'oeuvre cyclique; la peindre
successivement et simultanément sous tous ses aspects, histoire, fable,
philosophie, religion, science, lesquels se résument en un seul et
immense mouvement d'ascension vers la lumière; faire apparaître dans
une sorte de miroir sombre et clair--que l'interruption naturelle des
travaux terrestres brisera probablement avant qu'il ait la dimension
rêvée par l'auteur--cette grande figure une et multiple, lugubre et
rayonnante, fatale et sacrée, l'Homme; voilà de quelle pensée, de quelle
ambition, si l'on veut, est sortie _La Légende des Siècles_.

Le volume qu'on va lire n'en contient que la première partie, la
première série, comme dit le titre.

Les poèmes qui composent ce volume ne sont donc autre chose que des
empreintes successives du profil humain, de date en date, depuis Ève,
mère des hommes, jusqu'à la Révolution, mère des peuples; empreintes
prises, tantôt sur la barbarie, tantôt sur la civilisation, presque
toujours sur le vif de l'histoire; empreintes moulées sur le masque des
siècles.

Quand d'autres volumes se seront joints à celui-ci, de façon à rendre
l'oeuvre un peu moins incomplète, cette série d'empreintes, vaguement
disposées dans un certain ordre chronologique, pourra former une sorte
de galerie de la médaille humaine.

Pour le poète comme pour l'historien, pour l'archéologue comme pour
le philosophe, chaque siècle est un changement de physionomie de
l'humanité. On trouvera dans ce volume, qui, nous le répétons, sera
continué et complété, le reflet de quelques-uns de ces changements de
physionomie.

On y trouvera quelque chose du passé, quelque chose du présent et comme
un vague mirage de l'avenir. Du reste, ces poèmes, divers par le sujet,
mais inspirés par la même pensée, n'ont entre eux d'autre noeud qu'un
fil, ce fil qui s'atténue quelquefois au point de devenir invisible,
mais qui ne casse jamais, le grand fil mystérieux du labyrinthe humain,
le Progrès.

Comme dans une mosaïque, chaque pierre a sa couleur et sa forme propre;
l'ensemble donne une figure. La figure de ce livre, on l'a dit plus
haut, c'est l'Homme.

Ce volume d'ailleurs, qu'on veuille bien ne pas l'oublier, est à
l'ouvrage dont il fait partie, et qui sera mis au jour plus tard, ce que
serait à une symphonie l'ouverture. Il n'en peut donner l'idée exacte et
complète, mais il contient une lueur de l'oeuvre entière.

Le poème que l'auteur a dans l'esprit n'est ici qu'entr'ouvert.

Quant à ce volume pris en lui-même, l'auteur n'a qu'un mot à en dire. Le
genre humain, considéré comme un grand individu collectif accomplissant
d'époque en époque une série d'actes sur la terre, a deux aspects,
l'aspect historique et l'aspect légendaire. Le second n'est pas moins
vrai que le premier; le premier n'est pas moins conjectural que le
second.

Qu'on ne conclue pas de cette dernière ligne--disons-le en
passant--qu'il puisse entrer dans la pensée de l'auteur d'amoindrir la
haute valeur de l'enseignement historique. Pas une gloire, parmi
les splendeurs du génie humain, ne dépasse celle du grand historien
philosophe. L'auteur, seulement, sans diminuer la portée de l'histoire,
veut constater la portée de la légende. Hérodote fait l'histoire, Homère
fait la légende.

C'est l'aspect légendaire qui prévaut dans ce volume et qui en colore
les poèmes. Ces poèmes se passent l'un à l'autre le flambeau de la
tradition humaine. _Quasi cursores_. C'est ce flambeau, dont la flamme
est le vrai, qui fait l'unité de ce livre. Tous ces poèmes, ceux du
moins qui résument le passé, sont de la réalité historique condensée ou
de la réalité historique devinée. La fiction parfois, la falsification
jamais; aucun grossissement de lignes; fidélité absolue à la couleur des
temps et à l'esprit des civilisations diverses. Pour citer des exemples,
la _Décadence romaine_ n'a pas un détail qui ne soit rigoureusement
exact; la barbarie mahométane ressort de Cantemir, à travers
l'enthousiasme de l'historiographe turc, telle qu'elle est exposée dans
les premières pages de _Zim-Zizimi_ et de _Sultan Mourad_.

Du reste, les personnes auxquelles l'étude du passé est familière
reconnaîtront, l'auteur n'en doute pas, l'accent réel et sincère de
tout ce livre. Un de ces poèmes (_Première rencontre du Christ avec le
tombeau_) est tiré, l'auteur pourrait dire traduit, de l'évangile.
Deux autres (_Le Mariage de Roland_, _Aymerillot_) sont des feuillets
détachés de la colossale épopée du moyen âge (_Charlemagne, emperor à la
barbe florie_). Ces deux poèmes jaillissent directement des livres de
geste de la chevalerie. C'est de l'histoire écoutée aux portes de la
légende.

Quant au mode de formation de plusieurs des autres poèmes dans la pensée
de l'auteur, on pourra s'en faire une idée en lisant les quelques lignes
placées en note avant la pièce intitulée _Les Raisons du Momotombo_;
lignes d'où cette pièce est sortie. L'auteur en convient, un rudiment
imperceptible, perdu dans la chronique ou dans la tradition, à peine
visible à l'oeil nu, lui a souvent suffi. Il n'est pas défendu au poète
et au philosophe d'essayer sur les faits sociaux ce que le naturaliste
essaie sur les faits zoologiques, la reconstruction du monstre d'après
l'empreinte de l'ongle ou l'alvéole de la dent.

Ici lacune, là étude complaisante et approfondie d'un détail, tel
est l'inconvénient de toute publication fractionnée. Ces défauts de
proportion peuvent n'être qu'apparents. Le lecteur trouvera certainement
juste d'attendre, pour les apprécier définitivement, que _La Légende des
Siècles_ ait paru en entier. Les usurpations, par exemple, jouent un tel
rôle dans la construction des royautés au moyen âge et mêlent tant de
crimes à la complication des investitures, que l'auteur a cru devoir les
présenter sous leurs trois principaux aspects dans les trois drames, _Le
Petit Roi de Galice, Éviradnus, La Confiance du Marquis Fabrice. Ce qui
peut sembler aujourd'hui un développement excessif s'ajustera plus tard
à l'ensemble.

Les tableaux riants sont rares dans ce livre; cela tient à ce qu'ils ne
sont pas fréquents dans l'histoire.

Comme on le verra, l'auteur, en racontant le genre humain, ne l'isole
pas de son entourage terrestre. Il mêle quelquefois à l'homme, il heurte
à l'âme humaine, afin de lui faire rendre son véritable son, ces êtres
différents de l'homme que nous nommons bêtes, choses, nature morte, et
qui remplissent on ne sait quelles fonctions fatales dans l'équilibre
vertigineux de la création.

Tel est ce livre. L'auteur l'offre au public sans rien se dissimuler
de sa profonde insuffisance. C'est une tentative vers l'idéal. Rien de
plus.

Ce dernier mot a besoin peut-être d'être expliqué.

Plus tard, nous le croyons, lorsque plusieurs autres parties de ce livre
auront été publiées, on apercevra le lien qui, dans la conception de
l'auteur, rattache _La Légende des Siècles_ à deux autres poèmes,
presque terminés à cette heure, et qui en sont, l'un le dénoûment,
l'autre le commencement: _La Fin de Satan, Dieu_.

L'auteur, du reste, pour compléter ce qu'il a dit plus haut, ne voit
aucune difficulté à faire entrevoir, dès à présent, qu'il a esquissé
dans la solitude une sorte de poème d'une certaine étendue où se
réverbère le problème unique, l'Être, sous sa triple face: l'Humanité,
le Mal, l'Infini; le progressif, le relatif, l'absolu; en ce qu'on
pourrait appeler trois chants, _La Légende des Siècles, La Fin de Satan,
Dieu_.

Il publie aujourd'hui un premier carton de cette esquisse. Les autres
suivront.

Nul ne peut répondre d'achever ce qu'il a commencé, pas une minute de
continuation certaine n'est assurée à l'oeuvre ébauchée; la solution de
continuité, hélas! c'est tout l'homme; mais il est permis, même au plus
faible, d'avoir une bonne intention et de la dire.

Or l'intention de ce livre est bonne.

L'épanouissement du genre humain de siècle en siècle, l'homme montant
des ténèbres à l'idéal, la transfiguration paradisiaque de l'enfer
terrestre, l'éclosion lente et suprême de la liberté, droit pour cette
vie, responsabilité pour l'autre; une espèce d'hymne religieux à mille
strophes, ayant dans ses entrailles une foi profonde et sur son sommet
une haute prière; le drame de la création éclairé par le visage du
créateur, voilà ce que sera, terminé, ce poème dans son ensemble; si
Dieu, maître des existences humaines, y consent.

  Lorsque avec ses enfants vêtus de peaux de bêtes,
  Échevelé, livide au milieu des tempêtes,
  Caïn se fut enfui de devant Jéhovah,
  Comme le soir tombait, l'homme sombre arriva
  Au bas d'une montagne en une grande plaine;
  Sa femme fatiguée et ses fils hors d'haleine
  Lui dirent:--Couchons-nous sur la terre, et dormons.--
  Caïn, ne dormant pas, songeait au pied des monts
  Ayant levé la tête, au fond des cieux funèbres
  Il vit un oeil, tout grand ouvert dans les ténèbres,
  Et qui le regardait dans l'ombre fixement.
  --Je suis trop près, dit-il avec un tremblement.
  Il réveilla ses fils dormant, sa femme lasse,
  Et se remit à fuir sinistre dans l'espace.
  Il marcha trente jours, il marcha trente nuits.
  Il allait, muet, pâle et frémissant aux bruits,
  Furtif, sans regarder derrière lui, sans trêve,
  Sans repos, sans sommeil. Il atteignit la grève
  Des mers dans le pays qui fut depuis Assur.
  --Arrêtons-nous, dit-il, car cet asile est sûr.
  Restons-y. Nous avons du monde atteint les bornes.--
  Et, comme il s'asseyait, il vit dans les cieux mornes
  L'oeil à la même place au fond de l'horizon.
  Alors il tressaillit en proie au noir frisson.
  --Cachez-moi, cria-t-il; et, le doigt sur la bouche,
  Tous ses fils regardaient trembler l'aïeul farouche.
  Caïn dit à Jabel, père de ceux qui vont
  Sous des tentes de poil dans le désert profond:
  --Étends de ce côté la toile de la tente.--
  Et l'on développa la muraille flottante;
  Et, quand on l'eut fixée avec des poids de plomb
  - Vous ne voyez plus rien? dit Tsilla, l'enfant blond,
  La fille de ses fils, douce comme l'aurore;
  Et Caïn répondit:--je vois cet oeil encore!--
  Jubal, père de ceux qui passent dans les bourgs
  Soufflant dans des clairons et frappant des tambours,
  Cria:--je saurai bien construire une barrière.--
  Il fit un mur de bronze et mit Caïn derrière.
  Et Caïn dit:--Cet oeil me regarde toujours!
  Hénoch dit:--Il faut faire une enceinte de tours
  Si terrible, que rien ne puisse approcher d'elle.
  Bâtissons une ville avec sa citadelle.
  Bâtissons une ville, et nous la fermerons.--
  Alors Tubalcaïn, père des forgerons,
  Construisit une ville énorme et surhumaine.
  Pendant qu'il travaillait, ses frères, dans la plaine,
  Chassaient les fils d'Énos et les enfants de Seth;
  Et l'on crevait les yeux à quiconque passait;
  Et, le soir, on lançait des flèches aux étoiles.
  Le granit remplaça la tente aux murs de toiles,
  On lia chaque bloc avec des noeuds de fer,
  Et la ville semblait une ville d'enfer;
  L'ombre des tours faisait la nuit dans les campagnes;
  Ils donnèrent aux murs l'épaisseur des montagnes;
  Sur la porte on grava: `Défense à Dieu d'entrer.
  Quand ils eurent fini de clore et de murer,
  On mit l'aïeul au centre en une tour de pierre.
  Et lui restait lugubre et hagard.--O mon père!
  L'oeil a-t-il disparu? dit en tremblant Tsilla.
  Et Caïn répondit:--Non, il est toujours là.
  Alors il dit:--je veux habiter sous la terre,
  Comme dans son sépulcre un homme solitaire;
  Rien ne me verra plus, je ne verrai plus rien.--
  On fit donc une fosse, et Caïn dit: C'est bien!
  Puis il descendit seul sous cette voûte sombre.
  Quand il se fut assis sur sa chaise dans l'ombre,
  Et qu'on eut sur son front fermé le souterrain,
  L'oeil était dans la tombe et regardait Caïn.


PUISSANCE ÉGALE BONTÉ

  Au commencement, Dieu vit un jour dans l'espace
  Iblis venir à lui; Dieu dit:--Veux-tu ta grâce?
  --Non, dit le Mal.--Alors que me demandes-tu?
  --Dieu, répondit Iblis de ténèbres vêtu,
  Joutons à qui créera la chose la plus belle.
  L'Être dit: J'y consens.--Voici, dit le Rebelle;
  Moi, je prendrai ton oeuvre et la transformerai.
  Toi, tu féconderas ce que je t'offrirai;
  Et chacun de nous deux soufflera son génie
  Sur la chose par l'autre apportée et fournie.
  --Soit. Que te faut-il? Prends, dit l'Être avec dédain.
  --La tête du cheval et les cornes du daim.
  --Prends.--Le monstre hésitant que la brume enveloppe
  Reprit:--J'aimerais mieux celle de l'antilope.
  --Va, prends.--Iblis entra dans son antre et forgea.
  Puis il dressa le front.--Est-ce fini déjà?
  --Non.--Te faut-il encor quelque chose? dit l'Être.
  --Les yeux de l'éléphant, le cou du taureau, maître.
  --Prends.--Je demande en outre, ajouta le Rampant,
  Le ventre du cancer, les anneaux du serpent,
  Les cuisses du chameau, les pattes de l'autruche.
  --Prends.--Ainsi qu'on entend l'abeille dans la ruche,
  On entendait aller et venir dans l'enfer
  Le démon remuant des enclumes de fer.
  Nul regard ne pouvait voir à travers la nue
  Ce qu'il faisait au fond de la cave inconnue.
  Tout à coup, se tournant vers l'Être, Iblis hurla
  --Donne-moi la couleur de l'or. Dieu dit:--Prends-la.
  Et, grondant et râlant comme un boeuf qu'on égorge,
  Le démon se remit à battre dans sa forge;
  Il frappait du ciseau, du pilon, du maillet,
  Et toute la caverne horrible tressaillait;
  Les éclairs des marteaux faisaient une tempête;
  Ses yeux ardents semblaient deux braises dans sa tête;
  Il rugissait; le feu lui sortait des naseaux,
  Avec un bruit pareil au bruit des grandes eaux
  Dans la saison livide où la cigogne émigre.
  Dieu  dit:--Que  te  faut-il  encor?--Le  bond  du tigre.
  --Prends.--C'est bien, dit Iblis debout dans son volcan,
  Viens m'aider à souffler, dit-il à l'ouragan.
  L'âtre flambait; Iblis, suant à grosses gouttes,
  Se courbait, se tordait, et, sous les sombres voûtes,
  On ne distinguait rien qu'une sombre rougeur
  Empourprant le profil du monstrueux forgeur.
  Et l'ouragan l'aidait, étant démon lui-même.
  L'Être, parlant du haut du firmament suprême,
  Dit:--Que veux-tu de plus?--Et le grand paria,
  Levant sa tête énorme et triste, lui cria:
  --Le poitrail du lion et les ailes de l'aigle.
  Et Dieu jeta, du fond des éléments qu'il règle,
  A l'ouvrier d'orgueil et de rébellion
  L'aile de l'aigle avec le poitrail du lion.
  Et le démon reprit son oeuvre sous les voiles.
  --Quelle hydre fait-il donc? demandaient les étoiles.
  Et le monde attendait, grave, inquiet, béant,
  Le colosse qu'allait enfanter ce géant.
  Soudain, on entendit dans la nuit sépulcrale
  Comme un dernier effort jetant un dernier râle;
  L'Etna, fauve atelier du forgeron maudit,
  Flamboya; le plafond de l'enfer se fendit,
  Et, dans une clarté blême et surnaturelle,
  On vit des mains d'Iblis jaillir la sauterelle.

  Et l'infirme effrayant, l'être ailé, mais boiteux,
  Vit sa création et n'en fut pas honteux,
  L'avortement étant l'habitude de l'ombre.
  Il sortit à mi-corps de l'éternel décombre,
  Et, croisant ses deux bras, arrogant, ricanant,
  Cria dans l'infini:--Maître, à toi maintenant!
  Et ce fourbe, qui tend à Dieu même une embûche,
  Reprit:--Tu m'as donné l'éléphant et l'autruche,
  Et l'or pour dorer tout; et ce qu'ont de plus beau
  Le chameau, le cheval, le lion, le taureau,
  Le tigre et l'antilope, et l'aigle et la couleuvre;
  C'est mon tour de fournir la matière à ton oeuvre;
  Voici tout ce que j'ai. Je te le donne. Prends.--
  Dieu, pour qui les méchants mêmes sont transparents,
  Tendit sa grande main de lumière baignée
  Vers l'ombre, et le démon lui donna l'araignée.

  Et Dieu prit l'araignée et la mit au milieu
  Du gouffre qui n'était pas encor le ciel bleu;
  Et l'esprit regarda la bête; sa prunelle,
  Formidable, versait la lueur éternelle;
  Le monstre, si petit qu'il semblait un point noir,
  Grossit alors, et fut soudain énorme à voir;
  Et Dieu le regardait de son regard tranquille;
  Une aube étrange erra sur cette forme vile;
  L'affreux ventre devint un globe lumineux;
  Et les pattes, changeant en sphères d'or leurs noeuds,
  S'allongèrent dans l'ombre en grands rayons de flamme.
  Iblis leva les yeux; et tout à coup l'infâme,
  Ébloui, se courba sous l'abîme vermeil;
  Car Dieu, de l'araignée, avait fait le soleil.


BOOZ ENDORMI

  Booz s'était couché de fatigue accablé;
  Il avait tout le jour travaillé dans son aire,
  Puis avait fait son lit à sa place ordinaire;
  Booz dormait auprès des boisseaux pleins de blé.

  Ce vieillard possédait des champs de blés et d'orge;
  Il était, quoique riche, à la justice enclin;
  Il n'avait pas de fange en l'eau de son moulin,
  Il n'avait pas d'enfer dans le feu de sa forge.

  Sa barbe était d'argent comme un ruisseau d'avril.
  Sa gerbe n'était point avare ni haineuse;
  Quand il voyait passer quelque pauvre glaneuse:
  --Laissez tomber exprès des épis, disait-il.

  Cet homme marchait pur loin des sentiers obliques,
  Vêtu de probité candide et de lin blanc;
  Et, toujours du côté des pauvres ruisselant,
  Ses sacs de grains semblaient des fontaines publiques.

  Booz était bon maître et fidèle parent;
  Il était généreux, quoiqu'il fût économe;
  Les femmes regardaient Booz plus qu'un jeune homme.
  Car le jeune homme est beau, mais le vieillard est grand.

  Le vieillard, qui revient vers la source première,
  Entre aux jours éternels et sort des jours changeants;
  Et l'on voit de la flamme aux yeux des jeunes gens,
  Mais dans l'oeil du vieillard on voit de la lumière.


  Donc, Booz dans la nuit dormait parmi les siens;
  Près des meules, qu'on eût prises pour des décombres,
  Les moissonneurs couchés faisaient des groupes sombres;
  Et ceci se passait dans des temps très anciens.

  Les tribus d'Israël avaient pour chef un juge;
  La terre, où l'homme errait sous la tente, inquiet
  Des empreintes de pieds de géant qu'il voyait,
  Était encor mouillée et molle du déluge.


  Comme dormait Jacob, comme dormait Judith,
  Booz, les yeux fermés, gisait sous la feuillée;
  Or, la porte du ciel s'étant entre-bâillée
  Au-dessus de sa tête, un songe en descendit.

  Et ce songe était tel, que Booz vit un chêne
  Qui, sorti de son ventre, allait jusqu'au ciel bleu;
  Une race y montait comme une longue chaîne;
  Un roi chantait en bas, en haut mourait un dieu.

  Et Booz murmurait avec la voix de l'âme
  'Comment se pourrait-il que de moi ceci vînt?
  Le chiffre de mes ans a passé quatre vingt,
  Et je n'ai pas de fils, et je n'ai plus de femme.

  'Voilà longtemps que celle avec qui j'ai dormi,
  O Seigneur! a quitté ma couche pour la vôtre;
  Et nous sommes encor tout mêlés l'un à l'autre,
  Elle à demi vivante et moi mort à demi.

  'Une race naîtrait de moi! Comment le croire?
  Comment se pourrait-il que j'eusse des enfants?
  Quand on est jeune, on a des matins triomphants,
  Le jour sort de la nuit comme d'une victoire;

  'Mais, vieux, on tremble ainsi qu'à l'hiver le bouleau.
  Je suis veuf, je suis seul, et sur moi le soir tombe,
  Et je courbe, ô mon Dieu! mon âme vers la tombe,
  Comme un boeuf ayant soif penche son front vers l'eau.'

  Ainsi parlait Booz dans le rêve et l'extase,
  Tournant vers Dieu ses yeux par le sommeil noyés;
  Le cèdre ne sent pas une rose à sa base,
  Et lui ne sentait pas une femme à ses pieds.


  Pendant qu'il sommeillait, Ruth, une moabite,
  S'était couchée aux pieds de Booz, le sein nu,
  Espérant on ne sait quel rayon inconnu,
  Quand viendrait du réveil la lumière subite.

  Booz ne savait point qu'une femme était là,
  Et Ruth ne savait point ce que Dieu voulait d'elle,
  Un frais parfum sortait des touffes d'asphodèle;
  Les souffles de la nuit flottaient sur Galgala.

  L'ombre était nuptiale, auguste et solennelle;
  Les anges y volaient sans doute obscurément,
  Car on voyait passer dans la nuit, par moment,
  Quelque chose de bleu qui paraissait une aile.

  La respiration de Booz qui dormait,
  Se mêlait au bruit sourd des ruisseaux sur la mousse.
  On était dans le mois où la nature est douce,
  Les collines ayant des lis sur leur sommet.

  Ruth songeait et Booz dormait; l'herbe était noire;
  Les grelots des troupeaux palpitaient vaguement;
  Une immense bonté tombait du firmament;
  C'était l'heure tranquille où les lions vont boire.

  Tout reposait dans Ur et dans Jérimadeth;
  Les astres émaillaient le ciel profond et sombre;
  Le croissant fin et clair parmi ces fleurs de l'ombre
  Brillait à l'occident, et Ruth se demandait,

  Immobile, ouvrant l'oeil à moitié sous ses voiles,
  Quel dieu, quel moissonneur de l'éternel été
  Avait, en s'en allant, négligemment jeté
  Cette faucille d'or dans le champ des étoiles.


AU LION D'ANDROCLÈS

  La ville ressemblait à l'univers. C'était
  Cette heure où l'on dirait que toute âme se tait,
  Que tout astre s'éclipse et que le monde change.
  Rome avait étendu sa pourpre sur la fange.
  Où l'aigle avait plané, rampait le scorpion.
  Trimalcion foulait les os de Scipion.
  Rome buvait, gaie, ivre et la face rougie;
  Et l'odeur du tombeau sortait de cette orgie.
  L'amour et le bonheur, tout était effrayant.
  Lesbie en se faisant coiffer, heureuse, ayant
  Son Tibulle à ses pieds qui chantait leurs tendresses,
  Si l'esclave persane arrangeait mal ses tresses,
  Lui piquait les seins nus de son épingle d'or.
  Le mal à travers l'homme avait pris son essor;
  Toutes les passions sortaient de leurs orbites.
  Les fils aux vieux parents faisaient des morts subites.
  Les rhéteurs disputaient les tyrans aux bouffons.
  La boue et l'or régnaient. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  Rome horrible chantait. Parfois, devant ses portes,
  Quelque Crassus, vainqueur d'esclaves et de rois,
  Plantait le grand chemin de vaincus mis en croix;
  Et, quand Catulle, amant que notre extase écoute,
  Errait avec Délie, aux deux bords de la route,
  Six mille arbres humains saignaient sur leurs amours.
  La gloire avait hanté Rome dans les grands jours,
  Toute honte à présent était la bienvenue.
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  Épaphrodite avait un homme pour hochet
  Et brisait en jouant les membres d'Épictète.
  Femme grosse, vieillard débile, enfant qui tette,
  Captifs, gladiateurs, chrétiens, étaient jetés
  Aux bêtes, et, tremblants, blêmes, ensanglantés,
  Fuyaient, et l'agonie effarée et vivante
  Se tordait dans le cirque, abîme d'épouvante.
  Pendant que l'ours grondait, et que les éléphants,
  Effroyables, marchaient sur les petits enfants,
  La vestale songeait dans sa chaise de marbre.
  Par moments, le trépas, comme le fruit d'un arbre,
  Tombait du front pensif de la pâle beauté;
  Le même éclair de meurtre et de férocité
  Passait de l'oeil du tigre au regard de la vierge.
  Le monde était le bois, l'empire était l'auberge.
  De noirs passants trouvaient le trône en leur chemin,
  Entraient, donnaient un coup de dent au genre humain,
  Puis s'en allaient. Néron venait après Tibère.
  César foulait aux pieds le Hun, le Goth, l'Ibère;
  Et l'empereur, pareil aux fleurs qui durent peu,
  Le soir était charogne à moins qu'il ne fût dieu.
  Le porc Vitellius roulait aux gémonies.
  Escalier des grandeurs et des ignominies,
  Bagne effrayant des morts, pilori des néants,
  Saignant, fumant, infect, ce charnier de géants
  Semblait fait pour pourrir le squelette du monde.
  Des torturés râlaient sur cette rampe immonde,
  Juifs sans langue, poltrons sans poings, larrons sans yeux;
  Ainsi que dans le cirque atroce et furieux
  L'agonie était là, hurlant sur chaque marche.
  Le noir gouffre cloaque au fond ouvrait son arche
  Où croulait Rome entière; et, dans l'immense égout,
  Quand le ciel juste avait foudroyé coup sur coup,
  Parfois deux empereurs, chiffres du fatal nombre,
  Se rencontraient, vivants encore, et, dans cette ombre,
  Où les chiens sur leurs os venaient mâcher leur chair,
  Le césar d'aujourd'hui heurtait celui d'hier.
  Le crime sombre était l'amant du vice infâme.
  Au lieu de cette race en qui Dieu mit sa flamme,
  Au lieu d'Ève et d'Adam, si beaux, si purs tous deux,
  Une hydre se traînait dans l'univers hideux;
  L'homme était une tête et la femme était l'autre.
  Rome était la truie énorme qui se vautre.
  La créature humaine, importune au ciel bleu,
  Faisait une ombre affreuse à la cloison de Dieu;
  Elle n'avait plus rien de sa forme première;
  Son oeil semblait vouloir foudroyer la lumière;
  Et l'on voyait, c'était la veille d'Attila,
  Tout ce qu'on avait eu de sacré jusque-là
  Palpiter sous son ongle; et pendre à ses mâchoires,
  D'un côté les vertus et de l'autre les gloires.
  Les hommes rugissaient quand ils croyaient parler.
  L'âme du genre humain songeait à s'en aller;
  Mais, avant de quitter à jamais notre monde,
  Tremblante, elle hésitait sous la voûte profonde,
  Et cherchait une bête où se réfugier.
  On entendait la tombe appeler et crier.
  Au fond, la pâle Mort riait sinistre et chauve.
  Ce fut alors que toi, né dans le désert fauve
  Où le soleil est seul avec Dieu, toi, songeur
  De l'antre que le soir emplit de sa rougeur,
  Tu vins dans la cité toute pleine de crimes;
  Tu frissonnas devant tant d'ombre et tant d'abîmes;
  Ton oeil fit, sur ce monde horrible et châtié,
  Flamboyer tout à coup l'amour et la pitié;
  Pensif tu secouas ta crinière sur Rome;
  Et, l'homme étant le monstre, ô lion, tu fus l'homme.

LE MARIAGE DE ROLAND

  Ils se battent--combat terrible!--corps à corps.
  Voilà déjà longtemps que leurs chevaux sont morts;
  Ils sont là seuls tous deux dans une île du Rhône.
  Le fleuve à grand bruit roule un flot rapide et jaune,
  Le vent trempe en sifflant les brins d'herbe dans l'eau.
  L'archange saint Michel attaquant Apollo
  Ne ferait pas un choc plus étrange et plus sombre.
  Déjà, bien avant l'aube, ils combattaient dans l'ombre.
  Qui, cette nuit, eût vu s'habiller ces barons,
  Avant que la visière eût dérobé leurs fronts,
  Eût vu deux pages blonds, roses comme des filles.
  Hier, c'étaient deux enfants riant à leurs familles,
  Beaux, charmants;--aujourd'hui, sur ce fatal terrain,
  C'est le duel effrayant de deux spectres d'airain,
  Deux fantômes auxquels le démon prête une âme,
  Deux masques dont les trous laissent voir de la flamme.
  Ils luttent, noirs, muets, furieux, acharnés.
  Les bateliers pensifs qui les ont amenés
  Ont raison d'avoir peur et de fuir dans la plaine,
  Et d'oser, de bien loin, les épier à peine:
  Car de ces deux enfants, qu'on regarde en tremblant,
  L'un s'appelle Olivier et l'autre a nom Roland.

  Et, depuis qu'ils sont là, sombres, ardents, farouches
  Un mot n'est pas encor sorti de ces deux bouches.

  Olivier, sieur de Vienne et comte souverain,
  A pour père Gérard et pour aïeul Garin.
  Il fut pour ce combat habillé par son père.
  Sur sa targe est sculpté Bacchus faisant la guerre
  Aux Normands, Rollon ivre, et Rouen consterné,
  Et le dieu souriant par des tigres traîné,
  Chassant, buveur de vin, tous ces buveurs de cidre.
  Son casque est enfoui sous les ailes d'une hydre;
  Il porte le haubert que portait Salomon;
  Son estoc resplendit comme l'oeil d'un démon;
  Il y grava son nom afin qu'on s'en souvienne;
  Au moment du départ, l'archevêque de Vienne
  A béni son cimier de prince féodal.
  Roland a son habit de fer, et Durandal.

  Ils luttent de si près avec de sourds murmures,
  Que leur souffle âpre et chaud s'empreint sur leurs armures.
  Le pied presse le pied; l'île à leurs noirs assauts
  Tressaille au loin; l'acier mord le fer; des morceaux
  De heaume et de haubert, sans que pas un s'émeuve,
  Sautent à chaque instant dans l'herbe et dans le fleuve;
  Leurs brassards sont rayés de longs filets de sang
  Qui coule de leur crâne et dans leurs yeux descend.
  Soudain, sire Olivier, qu'un coup affreux démasque,
  Voit tomber à la fois son épée et son casque.
  Main vide et tête nue, et Roland l'oeil en feu!
  L'enfant songe à son père et se tourne vers Dieu.
  Durandal sur son front brille. Plus d'espérance!
  --Çà, dit Roland, je suis neveu du roi de France,
  Je dois me comporter en franc neveu de roi.
  Quand j'ai mon ennemi désarmé devant moi,
  Je m'arrête. Va donc chercher une autre épée,
  Et tâche, cette fois, qu'elle soit bien trempée.
  Tu feras apporter à boire en même temps,
  Car j'ai soif.

           --Fils, merci, dit Olivier.

                                     --J'attends,

  Dit Roland, hâte-toi.

                       Sire Olivier appelle
  Un batelier caché derrière une chapelle.

  --Cours à la ville, et dis à mon père qu'il faut
  Une autre épée à l'un de nous, et qu'il fait chaud.

  Cependant les héros, assis dans les broussailles,
  S'aident à délacer leurs capuchons de mailles,
  Se lavent le visage, et causent un moment.
  Le batelier revient, il a fait promptement;
  L'homme a vu le vieux comte; il rapporte une épée
  Et du vin, de ce vin qu'aimait le grand Pompée
  Et que Tournon récolte au flanc de son vieux mont.
  L'épée est cette illustre et fière Closamont,
  Que d'autres quelquefois appellent Haute-Claire.
  L'homme a fui. Les héros achèvent sans colère
  Ce qu'ils disaient, le ciel rayonne au-dessus d'eux;
  Olivier verse à boire à Roland; puis tous deux
  Marchent droit l'un vers l'autre, et le duel recommence.
  Voilà que par degrés de sa sombre démence
  Le combat les enivre, il leur revient au coeur
  Ce je ne sais quel dieu qui veut qu'on soit vainqueur,
  Et qui, s'exaspérant aux armures frappées,
  Mêle l'éclair des yeux aux lueurs des épées.

  Ils combattent, versant à flots leur sang vermeil.
  Le jour entier se passe ainsi. Mais le soleil
  Baisse vers l'horizon. La nuit vient.

                                      --Camarade,
  Dit Roland, je ne sais, mais je me sens malade.
  Je ne me soutiens plus, et je voudrais un peu
  De repos.

           --Je prétends, avec l'aide de Dieu,
  Dit le bel Olivier, le sourire à la lèvre,
  Vous vaincre par l'épée et non point par la fièvre.
  Dormez sur l'herbe verte; et, cette nuit, Roland,
  je vous éventerai de mon panache blanc.
  Couchez-vous et dormez.

                   --Vassal, ton âme est neuve,
  Dit Roland. Je riais, je faisais une épreuve.
  Sans m'arrêter et sans me reposer, je puis
  Combattre quatre jours encore, et quatre nuits.

  Le duel reprend. La mort plane, le sang ruisselle.
  Durandal heurte et suit Closamont; l'étincelle
  Jaillit de toutes parts sous leurs coups répétés.
  L'ombre autour d'eux s'emplit de sinistres clartés.
  Ils frappent; le brouillard du fleuve monte et fume;
  Le voyageur s'effraie et croit voir dans la brume
  D'étranges bûcherons qui travaillent la nuit.

  Le jour naît, le combat continue à grand bruit;
  La pâle nuit revient, ils combattent; l'aurore
  Reparaît dans les cieux, ils combattent encore.

  Nul repos. Seulement, vers le troisième soir,
  Sous un arbre, en causant, ils sont allés s'asseoir;
  Puis ont recommencé.

                        Le vieux Gérard dans Vienne
  Attend depuis trois jours que son enfant revienne.
  Il envoie un devin regarder sur les tours;
  Le devin dit: Seigneur, ils combattent toujours.

  Quatre jours sont passés, et l'île et le rivage
  Tremblent sous ce fracas monstrueux et sauvage.
  Ils vont, viennent, jamais fuyant, jamais lassés,
  Froissent le glaive au glaive et sautent les fossés,
  Et passent, au milieu des ronces remuées,
  Comme deux tourbillons et comme deux nuées.
  O chocs affreux! terreur! tumulte étincelant!
  Mais enfin Olivier saisit au corps Roland,
  Qui de son propre sang en combattant s'abreuve,
  Et jette d'un revers Durandal dans le fleuve.

  --C'est mon tour maintenant, et je vais envoyer
  Chercher un autre estoc pour vous, dit Olivier.
  Le sabre du géant Sinnagog est à Vienne.
  C'est, après Durandal, le seul qui vous convienne.
  Mon père le lui prit alors qu'il le défit.
  Acceptez-le.

                 Roland sourit.--Il me suffit
  De ce bâton.--Il dit, et déracine un chêne.

  Sire Olivier arrache un orme dans la plaine
  Et jette son épée, et Roland, plein d'ennui,
  L'attaque. Il n'aimait pas qu'on vînt faire après lui
  Les générosités qu'il avait déjà faites.

  Plus d'épée en leurs mains, plus de casque à leurs têtes.
  Ils luttent maintenant, sourds, effarés, béants,
  A grands coups de troncs d'arbre, ainsi que des géants.

  Pour la cinquième fois, voici que la nuit tombe.
  Tout à coup Olivier, aigle aux yeux de colombe,
  S'arrête et dit:

                 -Roland, nous n'en finirons point.
  Tant qu'il nous restera quelque tronçon au poing,
  Nous lutterons ainsi que lions et panthères.
  Ne vaudrait-il pas mieux que nous devinssions frères?
  Écoute, j'ai ma soeur, la belle Aude au bras blanc,
  Épouse-la.

            -Pardieu! je veux bien, dit Roland.
  Et maintenant buvons, car l'affaire était chaude.--

  C'est ainsi que Roland épousa la belle Aude.



AYMERILLOT

  Charlemagne, empereur à la barbe fleurie,
  Revient d'Espagne; il a le coeur triste, il s'écrie:
  --Roncevaux! Roncevaux! ô traître Ganelon!
  Car son neveu Roland est mort dans ce vallon
  Avec les douze pairs et toute son armée.
  Le laboureur des monts qui vit sous la ramée
  Est rentré chez lui, grave et calme, avec son chien;
  Il a baisé sa femme au front et dit: C'est bien.
  Il a lavé sa trompe et son arc aux fontaines;
  Et les os des héros blanchissent dans les plaines.
  Le bon roi Charle est plein de douleur et d'ennui;
  Son cheval syrien est triste comme lui.
  Il pleure; l'empereur pleure de la souffrance
  D'avoir perdu ses preux, ses douze pairs de France,
  Ses meilleurs chevaliers qui n'étaient jamais las,
  Et son neveu Roland, et la bataille, hélas!
  Et surtout de songer, lui, vainqueur des Espagnes,
  Qu'on fera des chansons dans toutes ces montagnes
  Sur ses guerriers tombés devant des paysans,
  Et qu'on en parlera plus de quatre cents ans!

  Cependant il chemine; au bout de trois journées
  Il arrive au sommet des hautes Pyrénées.
  Là, dans l'espace immense il regarde en rêvant;
  Et sur une montagne, au loin, et bien avant
  Dans les terres, il voit une ville très forte,
  Ceinte de murs avec deux tours à chaque porte.
  Elle offre à qui la voit ainsi dans le lointain
  Trente maîtresses tours avec des toits d'étain,
  Et des mâchicoulis de forme sarrasine
  Encor tout ruisselants de poix et de résine.
  Au centre est un donjon si beau, qu'en vérité
  On ne le peindrait pas dans tout un jour d'été.
  Ses créneaux sont scellés de plomb, chaque embrasure
  Cache un archer dont l'oeil toujours guette et mesure.
  Ses gargouilles font peur, à son faîte vermeil
  Rayonne un diamant gros comme le soleil,
  Qu'on ne peut regarder fixement de trois lieues.

  Sur la gauche est la mer aux grandes ondes bleues,
  Qui jusqu'à cette ville apporte ses dromons.

  Charle, en voyant ces tours tressaille sur les monts.

  --Mon sage conseiller, Naymes, duc de Bavière,
  Quelle est cette cité près de cette rivière?
  Qui la tient la peut dire unique sous les cieux.
  Or, je suis triste, et c'est le cas d'être joyeux.
  Oui, dussé-je rester quatorze ans dans ces plaines,
  0 gens de guerre, archers compagnons, capitaines,
  Mes enfants! mes lions! saint Denis m'est témoin
  Que j'aurai cette ville avant d'aller plus loin!--

  Le vieux Naymes frissonne à ce qu'il vient d'entendre.

  --Alors, achetez-la, car nul ne peut la prendre,
  Elle a pour se défendre, outre ses Béarnais,
  Vingt mille Turcs ayant chacun double harnais.
  Quant à nous, autrefois, c'est vrai, nous triomphâmes;
  Mais, aujourd'hui, vos preux ne valent pas des femmes,
  Ils sont tous harassés et du gîte envieux,
  Et je suis le moins las, moi qui suis le plus vieux.
  Sire, je parle franc et je ne farde guère.
  D'ailleurs, nous n'avons point de machines de guerre;
  Les chevaux sont rendus, les gens rassasiés;
  Je trouve qu'il est temps que vous vous reposiez,
  Et je dis qu'il faut être aussi fou que vous l'êtes
  Pour attaquer ces tours avec des arbalètes.

  L'empereur répondit au duc avec bonté:
  --Duc, tu ne m'as pas dit le nom de la cité?

  --On peut bien oublier quelque chose à mon âge.
  Mais, sire, ayez pitié de votre baronnage;
  Nous voulons nos foyers, nos logis, nos amours.
  C'est ne jouir jamais que conquérir toujours.
  Nous venons d'attaquer bien des provinces, sire,
  Et nous en avons pris de quoi doubler l'empire.
  Ces assiégés riraient de vous du haut des tours.
  Ils ont, pour recevoir sûrement des secours,
  Si quelque insensé vient heurter leurs citadelles,
  Trois souterrains creusés par les Turcs infidèles,
  Et qui vont, le premier, dans le val de Bastan,
  Le second, à Bordeaux, le dernier, chez Satan.

  L'empereur, souriant, reprit d'un air tranquille:
  --Duc, tu ne m'as pas dit le nom de cette ville?

  --C'est Narbonne.

              --Narbonne est belle, dit le roi,
  Et je l'aurai; je n'ai jamais vu, sur ma foi,
  Ces belles filles-là sans leur rire au passage,
  Et me piquer un peu les doigts à leur corsage.--

  Alors, voyant passer un comte de haut lieu,
  Et qu'on appelait Dreus de Montdidier.--Pardieu!
  Comte, ce bon duc Naymes expire de vieillesse!
  Mais vous, ami, prenez Narbonne, et je vous laisse
  Tout le pays d'ici jusques à Montpellier;
  Car vous êtes le fils d'un gentil chevalier;
  Votre oncle, que j'estime, était abbé de Chelles;
  Vous-même êtes vaillant; donc, beau sire, aux échelles!
  L'assaut!

             --Sire empereur, répondit Montdidier,
  Je ne suis désormais bon qu'à congédier;
  J'ai trop porté haubert, maillot, casque et salade;
  J'ai besoin de mon lit, car je suis fort malade;
  J'ai la fièvre; un ulcère aux jambes m'est venu;
  Et voilà plus d'un an que je n'ai couché nu.
  Gardez tout ce pays, car je n'en ai que faire.

  L'empereur ne montra ni trouble ni colère.
  Il chercha du regard Hugo de Cotentin;
  Ce seigneur était brave et comte palatin.

  --Hugues, dit-il, je suis aise de vous apprendre
  Que Narbonne est à vous; vous n'avez qu'à la prendre.

  Hugo de Cotentin salua l'empereur.

  --Sire, c'est un manant heureux qu'un laboureur!
  Le drôle gratte un peu la terre brune ou rouge
  Et, quand sa tâche est faite, il rentre dans son bouge.
  Moi, j'ai vaincu Tryphon, Thessalus, Gaïffer;
  Par le chaud, par le froid, je suis vêtu de fer;
  Au point du jour, j'entends le clairon pour antienne;
  Je n'ai plus à ma selle une boucle qui tienne;
  Voilà longtemps que j'ai pour unique destin
  De m'endormir fort tard pour m'éveiller matin,
  De recevoir des coups pour vous et pour les vôtres,
  Je suis très fatigué. Donnez Narbonne à d'autres.

  Le roi laissa tomber sa tête sur son sein.
  Chacun songeait, poussant du coude son voisin.
  Pourtant Charle, appelant Richer de Normandie:
  --Vous êtes grand seigneur et de race hardie,
  Duc; ne voudrez-vous pas prendre Narbonne un peu?

  --Empereur, je suis duc par la grâce de Dieu.
  Ces aventures-là vont aux gens de fortune.
  Quand on a ma duché, roi Charle, on n'en veut qu'une.
  L'empereur se tourna vers le comte de Gand.

  --Tu mis jadis à bas Maugiron le brigand.
  Le jour où tu naquis sur la plage marine,
  L'audace avec le souffle entra dans ta poitrine;
  Bavon, ta mère était de fort bonne maison;
  Jamais on ne t'a fait choir que par trahison;
  Ton âme après la chute était encor meilleure.
  je me rappellerai jusqu'à ma dernière heure
  L'air joyeux qui parut dans ton oeil hasardeux,
  Un jour que nous étions en marche seuls tous deux,
  Et que nous entendions dans les plaines voisines
  Le cliquetis confus des lances sarrasines.
  Le péril fut toujours de toi bien accueilli,
  Comte; eh bien! prends Narbonne et je t'en fais bailli.

  --Sire, dit le Gantois, je voudrais être en Flandre.
  J'ai faim, mes gens ont faim; nous venons d'entreprendre
  Une guerre à travers un pays endiablé;
  Nous y mangions, au lieu de farine de blé,
  Des rats et des souris, et, pour toutes ribotes,
  Nous avons dévoré beaucoup de vieilles bottes.
  Et puis votre soleil d'Espagne m'a hâlé
  Tellement, que je suis tout noir et tout brûlé;
  Et, quand je reviendrai de ce ciel insalubre
  Dans ma ville de Gand avec ce front lugubre,
  Ma femme, qui déjà peut-être a quelque amant,
  Me prendra pour un Maure et non pour un Flamand!
  J'ai hâte d'aller voir là-bas ce qui se passe.
  Quand vous me donneriez, pour prendre cette place,
  Tout l'or de Salomon et tout l'or de Pépin,
  Non! je m'en vais en Flandre, où l'on mange du pain.

  --Ces bons Flamands, dit Charle, il faut que cela mange.
  Il reprit:

           Çà, je suis stupide. Il est étrange
  Que je cherche un preneur de ville, ayant ici
  Mon vieil oiseau de proie, Eustache de Nancy.
  Eustache, à moi! Tu vois, cette Narbonne est rude;
  Elle a trente châteaux, trois fossés, et l'air prude;
  A chaque porte un camp, et, pardieu! j'oubliais,
  Là-bas, six grosses tours en pierre de liais.
  Ces douves-là nous font parfois si grise mine
  Qu'il faut recommencer à l'heure où l'on termine,
  Et que, la ville prise, on échoue au donjon.
  Mais qu'importe! es-tu pas le grand aigle?

                                       --Un pigeon,
  Un moineau, dit Eustache, un pinson dans la haie!
  Roi, je me sauve au nid. Mes gens veulent leur paie;
  Or, je n'ai pas le sou; sur ce, pas un garçon
  Qui me fasse crédit d'un coup d'estramaçon;
  Leurs yeux me donneront à peine une étincelle
  Par sequin qu'ils verront sortir de l'escarcelle.
  Tas de gueux! Quant à moi, je suis très ennuyé;
  Mon vieux poing tout sanglant n'est jamais essuyé;
  Je suis moulu. Car, sire, on s'échine à la guerre;
  On arrive à haïr ce qu'on aimait naguère,
  Le danger qu'on voyait tout rose, on le voit noir;
  On s'use, on se disloque, on finit par avoir
  La goutte aux reins, l'entorse aux pieds, aux mains l'ampoule,
  Si bien qu'étant parti vautour, on revient poule.
  Je désire un bonnet de nuit. Foin du cimier!
  J'ai tant de gloire, ô roi, que j'aspire au fumier.

  Le bon cheval du roi frappait du pied la terre
  Comme s'il comprenait; sur le mont solitaire
  Les nuages passaient. Gérard de Roussillon
  Était à quelques pas avec son bataillon;
  Charlemagne en riant vint à lui.

                               --Vaillant homme,
  Vous êtes dur et fort comme un Romain de Rome;
  Vous empoignez le pieu sans regarder aux clous;
  Gentilhomme de bien, cette ville est à vous!--

  Gérard de Roussillon regarda d'un air sombre
  Son vieux gilet de fer rouillé, le petit nombre
  De ses soldats marchant tristement devant eux,
  Sa bannière trouée et son cheval boiteux.

  --Tu rêves, dit le roi, comme un clerc en Sorbonne.
  Faut-il donc tant songer pour accepter Narbonne?

  --Roi, dit Gérard, merci, j'ai des terres ailleurs.--

  Voilà comme parlaient tous ces fiers batailleurs
  Pendant que les torrents mugissaient sous les chênes.

  L'empereur fit le tour de tous ses capitaines;
  Il appela les plus hardis, les plus fougueux,
  Eudes, roi de Bourgogne, Albert de Périgueux,
  Samo, que la légende aujourd'hui divinise,
  Garin, qui, se trouvant un beau jour à Venise,
  Emporta sur son dos le lion de Saint-Marc,
  Ernaut de Bauléande, Ogier de Danemark,
  Roger, enfin, grande âme au péril toujours prête.
  Ils refusèrent tous.

                          Alors, levant la tête,
  Se dressant tout debout sur ses grands étriers,
  Tirant sa large épée aux éclairs meurtriers,
  Avec un âpre accent plein de sourdes huées,
  Pâle, effrayant, pareil à l'aigle des nuées,
  Terrassant du regard son camp épouvanté,
  L'invincible empereur s'écria:
  --Lâcheté!
  O comtes palatins tombés dans ces vallées,
  O géants qu'on voyait debout dans les mêlées,
  Devant qui Satan même aurait crié merci,
  Olivier et Roland, que n'êtes-vous ici!
  Si vous étiez vivants, vous prendriez Narbonne,
  Paladins! vous, du moins, votre épée était bonne,
  Votre coeur était haut, vous ne marchandiez pas!
  Vous alliez en avant sans compter tous vos pas!
  O compagnons couchés dans la tombe profonde,
  Si vous étiez vivants, nous prendrions le monde!
  Grand Dieu! que voulez-vous que je fasse à présent?
  Mes yeux cherchent en vain un brave au coeur puissant
  Et vont, tout effrayés de nos immenses tâches,
  De ceux-là qui sont morts à ceux-ci qui sont lâches!
  Je ne sais point comment on porte des affronts
  Je les jette à mes pieds, je n'en veux pas! Barons,
  Vous qui m'avez suivi jusqu'à cette montagne,
  Normands, Lorrains, marquis des marches d'Allemagne,
  Poitevins, Bourguignons, gens du pays Pisan,
  Bretons, Picards, Flamands, Français, allez-vous-en!
  Guerriers, allez-vous-en d'auprès de ma personne,
  Des camps où l'on entend mon noir clairon qui sonne
  Rentrez dans vos logis, allez-vous-en chez vous,
  Allez-vous-en d'ici, car je vous chasse tous!
  Je ne veux plus de vous! Retournez chez vos femmes!
  Allez vivre cachés, prudents, contents, infâmes!
  C'est ainsi qu'on arrive à l'âge d'un aïeul.
  Pour moi, j'assiégerai Narbonne à moi tout seul.
  Je reste ici rempli de joie et d'espérance!
  Et, quand vous serez tous dans notre douce France,
  O vainqueurs des Saxons et des Aragonais!
  Quand vous vous chaufferez les pieds à vos chenets,
  Tournant le dos aux jours de guerres et d'alarmes,
  Si l'on vous dit, songeant à tous vos grands faits d'armes
  Qui remplirent longtemps la terre de terreur
  --Mais où donc avez-vous quitté votre empereur?
  Vous répondrez, baissant les yeux vers la muraille:
  --Nous nous sommes enfuis le jour d'une bataille,
  Si vite et si tremblants et d'un pas si pressé
  Que nous ne savons plus où nous l'avons laissé!--

  Ainsi Charles de France appelé Charlemagne,
  Exarque de Ravenne, empereur d'Allemagne,
  Parlait dans la montagne avec sa grande voix;
  Et les pâtres lointains, épars au fond des bois,
  Croyaient en l'entendant que c'était le tonnerre.

  Les barons consternés fixaient leurs yeux à terre.
  Soudain, comme chacun demeurait interdit,
  Un jeune homme bien fait sortit des rangs et dit:

  --Que monsieur saint Denis garde le roi de France!
  L'empereur fut surpris de ce ton d'assurance.
  Il regarda celui qui s'avançait, et vit,
  Comme le roi Saül lorsque apparut David,
  Une espèce d'enfant au teint rose, aux mains blanches,
  Que d'abord les soudards dont l'estoc bat les hanches
  Prirent pour une fille habillée en garçon,
  Doux, frêle, confiant, serein, sans écusson
  Et sans panache, ayant, sous ses habits de serge,
  L'air grave d'un gendarme et l'air froid d'une vierge.

  --Toi, que veux-tu, dit Charle, et qu'est-ce qui t'émeut?

  --Je viens vous demander ce dont pas un ne veut,
  L'honneur d'être, ô mon roi, si Dieu ne m'abandonne,
  L'homme dont on dira: C'est lui qui prit Narbonne.

  L'enfant parlait ainsi d'un air de loyauté,
  Regardant tout le monde avec simplicité.

  Le Gantois, dont le front se relevait très vite,
  Se mit à rire, et dit aux reîtres de sa suite:
  -Hé! c'est Aymerillot, le petit compagnon.

  --Aymerillot, reprit le roi, dis-nous ton nom.

  --Aymery. Je suis pauvre autant qu'un pauvre moine.
  J'ai vingt ans, je n'ai point de paille et point d'avoine,
  Je sais lire en latin, et je suis bachelier.
  Voilà tout, sire. Il plut au sort de m'oublier
  Lorsqu'il distribua les fiefs héréditaires.
  Deux liards couvriraient fort bien toutes mes terres,

  Mais tout le grand ciel bleu n'emplirait pas mon coeur.
  J'entrerai dans Narbonne et je serai vainqueur.
  Après, je châtierai les railleurs, s'il en reste.

  Charles, plus rayonnant que l'archange céleste,
  S'écria:

             --Tu seras, pour ce propos hautain,
  Aymery de Narbonne et comte palatin,
  Et l'on te parlera d'une façon civile.
  Va, fils!

            Le lendemain Aymery prit la ville.


BIVAR

  Bivar était, au fond d'un bois sombre, un manoir
  Carré, flanqué de tours, fort vieux, et d'aspect noir.
  La cour était petite et la porte était laide.
  Quand le scheik Jabias, depuis roi de Tolède,
  Vint visiter le Cid au retour de Cintra,
  Dans l'étroit patio le prince maure entra;
  Un homme, qui tenait à la main une étrille,
  Pansait une jument attachée à la grille;
  Cet homme, dont le scheik ne voyait que le dos,
  Venait de déposer à terre des fardeaux,
  Un sac d'avoine, une auge, un harnais, une selle;
  La bannière arborée au donjon était celle
  De don Diègue, ce père étant encor vivant;
  L'homme, sans voir le scheik, frottant, brossant, lavant,
  Travaillait, tête nue et bras nus, et sa veste
  Était d'un cuir farouche, et d'une mode agreste;
  Le scheik, sans ébaucher même un _buenos dias_,
  Dit:--Manant, je viens voir le seigneur Ruy Diaz,
  Le grand campéador des Castilles.--Et l'homme,
  Se retournant, lui dit: C'est moi.

                           --Quoi! vous qu'on nomme
  Le héros, le vaillant, le seigneur des pavois,
  S'écria Jabias, c'est vous qu'ainsi je vois!
  Quoi! c'est vous qui n'avez qu'à vous mettre en campagne,
  Et qu'à dire: Partons! pour donner à l'Espagne,
  D'Avis à Gibraltar, d'Algarve à Cadafal,
  O grand Cid, le frisson du clairon triomphal,
  Et pour faire accourir au-dessus de vos tentes,
  Ailes au vent, l'essaim des victoires chantantes!
  Lorsque je vous ai vu, seigneur, moi prisonnier,
  Vous vainqueur, au palais du roi, l'été dernier,
  Vous aviez l'air royal du conquérant de l'Èbre;
  Vous teniez à la main la Tizona célèbre;
  Votre magnificence emplissait cette cour,
  Comme il sied quand on est celui d'où vient le jour;
  Cid, vous étiez vraiment un Bivar très superbe;
  On eût dans un brasier cueilli des touffes d'herbe,
  Seigneur, plus aisément, certes, qu'on n'eût trouvé
  Quelqu'un qui devant vous prît le haut du pavé;
  Plus d'un richomme avait pour orgueil d'être membre
  De votre servidumbre et de votre antichambre;
  Le Cid dans sa grandeur allait, venait, parlait,
  La faisant boire à tous, comme aux enfants le lait;
  D'altiers ducs, tous enflés de faste et de tempête,
  Qui, depuis qu'ils avaient le chapeau sur la tête,
  D'aucun homme vivant ne s'étaient souciés,
  Se levaient, sans savoir pourquoi, quand vous passiez;
  Vous vous faisiez servir par tous les gentilshommes;
  Le Cid comme une altesse avait ses majordomes;
  Lerme était votre archer; Gusman, votre frondeur;
  Vos habits étaient faits avec de la splendeur;
  Vous si bon, vous aviez la pompe de l'armure;
  Votre miel semblait or comme l'orange mûre;
  Sans cesse autour de vous vingt coureurs étaient prêts;
  Nul n'était au-dessus du Cid, et nul auprès;
  Personne, eût-il été de la royale estrade,
  Prince, infant, n'eût osé vous dire: Camarade!
  Vous éclatiez, avec des rayons jusqu'aux cieux,
  Dans une préséance éblouissante aux yeux;
  Vous marchiez entouré d'un ordre de bataille;
  Aucun sommet n'était trop haut pour votre taille,
  Et vous étiez un fils d'une telle fierté
  Que les aigles volaient tous de votre côté.
  Vous regardiez ainsi que néants et fumées
  Tout ce qui n'était pas commandement d'armées,
  Et vous ne consentiez qu'au nom de général;
  Cid était le baron suprême et magistral;
  Vous dominiez tout, grand, sans chef, sans joug, sans digue,
  Absolu, lance au poing, panache au front.

                                         Rodrigue
  Répondit:--Je n'étais alors que chez le roi.
  Et le scheik s'écria:--Mais, Cid, aujourd'hui, quoi,
  Que s'est-il donc passé? quel est cet équipage?
  J'arrive, et je vous trouve en veste, comme un page,
  Dehors, bras nus, nu-tête, et si petit garçon
  Que vous avez en main l'auge et le caveçon!
  Et faisant ce qu'il sied aux écuyers de faire!

  --Scheik, dit le Cid, je suis maintenant chez mon père.



EVIRADNUS

DÉPART DE L'AVENTURIER POUR L'AVENTURE

  Qu'est-ce que Sigismond et Ladislas ont dit?
  Je ne sais si la roche ou l'arbre l'entendit;
  Mais, quand ils ont tout bas parlé dans la broussaille,
  L'arbre a fait un long bruit de taillis qui tressaille,
  Comme si quelque bête en passant l'eût troublé,
  Et l'ombre du rocher ténébreux a semblé
  Plus noire, et l'on dirait qu'un morceau de cette ombre
  A pris forme et s'en est allé dans le bois sombre,
  Et maintenant on voit comme un spectre marchant
  Là-bas dans la clarté sinistre du couchant.

  Ce n'est pas une bête en son gîte éveillée,
  Ce n'est pas un fantôme éclos sous la feuillée,
  Ce n'est pas un morceau de l'ombre du rocher
  Qu'on voit là-bas au fond des clairières marcher;
  C'est un vivant qui n'est ni stryge ni lémure;
  Celui qui marche là, couvert d'une âpre armure,
  C'est le grand chevalier d'Alsace, Éviradnus.

  Ces hommes qui parlaient, il les a reconnus;
  Comme il se reposait dans le hallier, ces bouches
  Ont passé, murmurant des paroles farouches,
  Et jusqu'à son oreille un mot est arrivé;
  Et c'est pourquoi ce juste et ce preux s'est levé.

  Il connaît ce pays qu'il parcourut naguère.

  Il rejoint l'écuyer Gaselin, page de guerre,
  Qui l'attend dans l'auberge, au plus profond du val,
  Où tout à l'heure il vient de laisser son cheval
  Pour qu'en hâte on lui donne à boire, et qu'on le ferre.
  Il dit au forgeron:--Faites vite. Une affaire
  M'appelle.--Il monte en selle et part.


II

  ÉVIRADNUS

                                          Éviradnus,
  Vieux, commence à sentir le poids des ans chenus;
  Mais c'est toujours celui qu'entre tous on renomme,
  Le preux que nul n'a vu de son sang économe;
  Chasseur du crime, il est nuit et jour à l'affût;
  De sa vie il n'a fait d'action qui ne fût
  Sainte, blanche et loyale, et la grande pucelle,
  L'épée, en sa main pure et sans tache étincelle.
  C'est le Samson chrétien, qui, survenant à point,
  N'ayant pour enfoncer la porte que son poing,
  Entra, pour la sauver, dans Sickingen en flamme;
  Qui, s'indignant de voir honorer un infâme,
  Fit, sous son dur talon, un tas d'arceaux rompus
  Du monument bâti pour l'affreux duc Lupus,
  Arracha la statue, et porta la colonne
  Du munster de Strasbourg au pont de Wasselonne,
  Et là, fier, la jeta dans les étangs profonds;
  On vante Éviradnus d'Altorf à Chaux-de-Fonds;
  Quand il songe et s'accoude, on dirait Charlemagne;
  Rôdant, tout hérissé, du bois à la montagne,
  Velu, fauve, il a l'air d'un loup qui serait bon;
  Il a sept pieds de haut comme Jean de Bourbon;
  Tout entier au devoir qu'en sa pensée il couve,
  Il ne se plaint de rien, mais seulement il trouve
  Que les hommes sont bas et que les lits sont courts;
  Il écoute partout si l'on crie au secours;
  Quand les rois courbent trop le peuple, il le redresse
  Avec une intrépide et superbe tendresse;
  Il défendit Alix comme Diègue Urraca;
  Il est le fort, ami du faible; il attaqua
  Dans leurs antres les rois du Rhin, et dans leurs bauges
  Les barons effrayants et difformes des Vosges;
  De tout peuple orphelin il se faisait l'aïeul;
  Il mit en liberté les villes; il vint seul
  De Hugo Tête-d'Aigle affronter la caverne;
  Bon, terrible, il brisa le carcan de Saverne,
  La ceinture de fer de Schelestadt l'anneau
  De Colmar et la chaîne au pied de Haguenau
  Tel fut Éviradnus. Dans l'horrible balance
  Où les princes jetaient le dol, la violence,
  L'iniquité, l'horreur, le mal, le sang, le feu,
  Sa grande épée était le contre-poids de Dieu.
  Il est toujours en marche, attendu qu'on moleste
  Bien des infortunés sous voûte céleste,
  Et qu'on voit dans la nuit bien des mains supplier;
  Sa lance n'aime pas moisir au râtelier;
  Sa hache de bataille aisément se décroche;
  Malheur à l'action mauvaise qui s'approche
  Trop pres d'Éviradnus, le champion d'acier!
  La mort tombe de lui comme l'eau du glacier.
  Il est héros; il a pour cousine la race
  Des Amadis de France et des Pyrrhus de Thrace.
  Il rit des ans. Cet homme, à qui le monde entier
  N'eût pas fait dire Grâce! et demander quartier,
  Ira-t-il pas crier au temps: Miséricorde!
  Il s'est, comme Baudoin, ceint les reins d'une corde;
  Tout vieux qu'il est, il est de la grande tribu;
  Le moins fier des oiseaux n'est pas l'aigle barbu.
  Qu'importe l'âge? il lutte. Il vient de Palestine,
  Il n'est point las. Les ans s'acharnent; il s'obstine.


III

DANS LA FORÊT

  Quelqu'un qui s'y serait perdu ce soir verrait
  Quelque chose d'étrange au fond de la forêt;
  C'est une grande salle éclairée et déserte.
  Où?  Dans l'ancien manoir de Corbus.

  L'herbe verte,
  Le lierre, le chiendent, l'églantier sauvageon,
  Font, depuis trois cents ans, l'assaut de ce donjon;
  Le burg, sous cette abjecte et rampante escalade,
  Meurt, comme sous la lèpre un sanglier malade;
  Il tombe; les fossés s'emplissent des créneaux;
  La ronce, ce serpent, tord sur lui ses anneaux;
  Le moineau franc, sans même entendre ses murmures,
  Sur ses vieux pierriers morts vient becqueter les mûres;
  L'épine sur son deuil prospère insolemment;
  Mais, l'hiver, il se venge; alors, le burg dormant
  S'éveille, et, quand il pleut pendant des nuits entières,
  Quand l'eau glisse des toits et s'engouffre aux gouttières,
  Il rend grâce à l'ondée, aux vents, et, content d'eux,
  Profite, pour cracher sur le lierre hideux
  Des bouches de granit de ses quatre gargouilles.

  Le burg est aux lichens comme le glaive aux rouilles;
  Hélas! et Corbus, triste, agonise. Pourtant
  L'hiver lui plaît; l'hiver, sauvage combattant,
  Il se refait, avec les convulsions sombres
  Des nuages hagards croulant sur ses décombres,
  Avec l'éclair qui frappe et fuit comme un larron,
  Avec des souffles noirs qui sonnent du clairon,
  Une sorte de vie effrayante, à sa taille:
  La tempête est la soeur fauve de la bataille;
  Et le puissant donjon, féroce, échevelé,
  Dit: Me voilà! sitôt que la bise a sifflé;
  Il rit quand l'équinoxe irrité le querelle
  Sinistrement, avec son haleine de grêle;
  Il est joyeux, ce burg, soldat encore debout,
  Quand, jappant comme un chien poursuivi par un loup,
  Novembre, dans la brume errant de roche en roche,
  Répond au hurlement de janvier qui s'approche.
  Le donjon crie: En guerre! ô tourmente, es-tu là?
  Il craint peu l'ouragan, lui qui vit Attila.
  Oh! les lugubres nuits! Combats dans la bruine;
  La nuée attaquant, farouche, la ruine!
  Un ruissellement vaste, affreux, torrentiel,
  Descend des profondeurs furieuses du ciel;
  Le burg brave la nue; on entend les gorgones
  Aboyer aux huit coins de ses tours octogones;
  Tous les monstres sculptés sur l'édifice épars
  Grondent, et les lions de pierre des remparts
  Mordent la brume, l'air et l'onde, et les tarasques
  Battent de l'aile au souffle horrible des bourrasques;
  L'âpre averse en fuyant vomit sur les griffons;
  Et, sous la pluie entrant par les trous des plafonds,
  Les guivres, les dragons, les méduses, les drées,
  Grincent des dents au fond des chambres effondrées;
  Le château de granit, pareil au preux de fer,
  Lutte toute la nuit, résiste tout l'hiver;
  En vain le ciel s'essouffle, en vain janvier se rue;
  En vain tous les passants de cette sombre rue
  Qu'on nomme l'infini, l'ombre et l'immensité,
  Le tourbillon, d'un fouet invisible hâté,
  Le tonnerre, la trombe où le typhon se dresse,
  S'acharnent sur la fière et haute forteresse;
  L'orage la secoue en vain comme un fruit mûr;
  Les vents perdent leur peine à guerroyer ce mur,
  Le föhn bruyant s'y lasse, et sur cette cuirasse
  L'aquilon s'époumone et l'autan se harasse,
  Et tous ces noirs chevaux de l'air sortent fourbus
  De leur bataille avec le donjon de Corbus.

  Aussi, malgré la ronce et le chardon et l'herbe,
  Le vieux burg est resté triomphal et superbe;
  Il est comme un pontife au coeur du bois profond,
  Sa tour lui met trois rangs de créneaux sur le front;
  Le soir, sa silhouette immense se découpe;
  Il a pour trône un roc, haute et sublime croupe;
  Et, par les quatre coins, sud, nord, couchant, levant,
  Quatre monts, Crobius, Bléda, géants du vent,
  Aptar où croît le pin, Toxis que verdit l'orme,
  Soutiennent au-dessus de sa tiare énorme
  Les nuages, ce dais livide de la nuit.

  Le pâtre a peur, et croit que cette tour le suit;
  Les superstitions ont fait Corbus terrible;
  On dit que l'Archer Noir a pris ce burg pour cible,
  Et que sa cave est l'antre où dort le Grand Dormant;
  Car les gens des hameaux tremblent facilement,
  Les légendes toujours mêlent quelque fantôme
  A l'obscure vapeur qui sort des toits de chaume,
  L'âtre enfante le rêve, et l'on voit ondoyer
  L'effroi dans la fumée errante du foyer.

  Aussi, le paysan rend grâce à sa roture
  Qui le dispense, lui, d'audace et d'aventure,
  Et lui permet de fuir ce burg de la forêt
  Qu'un preux, par point d'honneur belliqueux, chercherait.

  Corbus voit rarement au loin passer un homme.
  Seulement, tous les quinze ou vingt ans, l'économe
  Et l'huissier du palais, avec des cuisiniers
  Portant tout un festin dans de larges paniers,
  Viennent, font des apprêts mystérieux, et partent;
  Et, le soir, à travers des branches qui s'écartent,
  On voit de la lumière au fond du burg noirci,
  Et nul n'ose approcher. Et pourquoi? Le voici.

LA COUTUME DE L'USAGE

  C'est l'usage, à la mort du marquis de Lusace,
  Que l'héritier du trône, en qui revit la race,
  Avant de revêtir les royaux attributs,
  Aille, une nuit, souper dans la tour de Corbus;
  C'est de ce noir souper qu'il sort prince et margrave;
  La marquise n'est bonne et le marquis n'est brave
  Que s'ils ont respiré les funèbres parfums
  Des siècles dans ce nid des vieux maîtres défunts.
  Les marquis de Lusace ont une haute tige,
  Et leur source est profonde à donner le vertige;
  Ils ont pour père Antée, ancêtre d'Attila;
  De ce vaincu d'Alcide une race coula;
  C'est la race autrefois Payenne, puis chrétienne,
  De Lechus, de Platon, d'Othon, d'Ursus, d'Étienne,
  Et de tous ces seigneurs des rocs et des forêts
  Bordant l'Europe au nord, flot d'abord, digue après.
  Corbus est double; il est burg au bois, ville en plaine.
  Du temps où l'on montait sur la tour châtelaine,
  On voyait, au delà des pins et des rochers,
  Sa ville perçant l'ombre au loin de ses clochers;
  Cette ville a des murs; pourtant ce n'est pas d'elle
  Que relève l'antique et noble citadelle;
  Fière, elle s'appartient; quelquefois un château
  Est l'égal d'une ville; en Toscane, Prato,
  Barletta dans la Pouille, et Crême en Lombardie,
  Valent une cité, même forte et hardie;
  Corbus est de ce rang. Sur ses rudes parois
  Ce burg a le reflet de tous les anciens rois;
  Tous leurs évènements, toutes leurs funérailles,
  Ont, chantant ou pleurant, traversé ses murailles,
  Tous s'y sont mariés, la plupart y sont nés;
  C'est là que flamboyaient ces barons couronnés;
  Corbus est le berceau de la royauté scythe.
  Or, le nouveau marquis doit faire une visite
  A l'histoire qu'il va continuer. La loi
  Veut qu'il soit seul pendant la nuit qui le fait roi.
  Au seuil de la forêt, un clerc lui donne à boire
  Un vin mystérieux versé dans un ciboire,
  Qui doit, le soir venu, l'endormir jusqu'au jour;
  Puis on le laisse, il part et monte dans la tour;
  Il trouve dans la salle une table dressée;
  Il soupe et dort; et l'ombre envoie à sa pensée
  Tous les spectres des rois depuis le duc Bela:
  Nul n'oserait entrer au burg cette nuit-là;
  Le lendemain, on vient en foule, on le délivre;
  Et, plein des visions du sommeil, encore ivre
  De tous ces grands aïeux qui lui sont apparus,
  On le mène à l'église où dort Borivorus;
  L'évêque lui bénit la bouche et la paupière,
  Et met dans ses deux mains les deux haches de pierre
  Dont Attila frappait juste comme la mort,
  D'un bras sur le midi, de l'autre sur le nord.

  Ce jour-là, sur les tours de la ville, on arbore
  Le menaçant drapeau du marquis Swantibore
  Qui lia dans les bois et fit manger aux loups
  Sa femme et le taureau dont il était jaloux.

  Même quand l'héritier du trône est une femme,
  Le souper de la tour de Corbus la réclame;
  C'est la loi; seulement, la pauvre femme a peur.


V

LA MARQUISE MAHAUD

  La nièce du dernier marquis, Jean le Frappeur,
  Mahaud, est aujourd'hui marquise de Lusace.
  Dame, elle a la couronne, et, femme, elle a la grâce.
  Une reine n'est pas reine sans la beauté.
  C'est peu que le royaume, il faut la royauté.
  Dieu dans son harmonie également emploie
  Le cèdre qui résiste et le roseau qui ploie,
  Et, certes, il est bon qu'une femme parfois
  Ait dans sa main les moeurs, les esprits et les lois,
  Succède au maître altier, sourie au peuple, et mène,
  En lui parlant tout bas, la sombre troupe humaine;
  Mais la douce Mahaud, dans ces temps de malheur,
  Tient trop le sceptre, hélas! comme on tient une fleur;
  Elle est gaie, étourdie, imprudente et peureuse.
  Toute une Europe obscure autour d'elle se creuse;
  Et, quoiqu'elle ait vingt ans, on a beau la prier,
  Elle n'a pas encor voulu se marier.
  Il est temps cependant qu'un bras viril l'appuie;
  Comme l'arc-en-ciel rit entre l'ombre et la pluie,
  Comme la biche joue entre le tigre et l'ours,
  Elle a, la pauvre belle aux purs et chastes jours,
  Deux noirs voisins qui font une noire besogne,
  L'empereur d'Allemagne et le roi de Pologne.

LES DEUX VOISINS

  Toute la différence entre ce sombre roi
  Et ce sombre empereur, sans foi, sans Dieu, sans loi,
  C'est que l'un est la griffe et que l'autre est la serre;
  Tous deux vont à la messe et disent leur rosaire,
  Ils n'en passent pas moins pour avoir fait tous deux
  Dans l'enfer un traité d'alliance hideux;
  On va même jusqu'à chuchoter à voix basse,
  Dans la foule où la peur d'en haut tombe et s'amasse,
  L'affreux texte d'un pacte entre eux et le pouvoir
  Qui s'agite sous l'homme au fond du monde noir;
  Quoique l'un soit la haine et l'autre la vengeance,
  Ils vivent côte à côte en bonne intelligence;
  Tous les peuples qu'on voit saigner à l'horizon
  Sortent de leur tenaille et sont de leur façon;
  Leurs deux figures sont lugubrement grandies
  Par de rouges reflets de sacs et d'incendies;
  D'ailleurs, comme David, suivant l'usage ancien,
  L'un est poëte, et l'autre est bon musicien;
  Et, les déclarant dieux, la renommée allie
  Leurs noms dans les sonnets qui viennent d'Italie.
  L'antique hiérarchie a l'air mise en oubli,
  Car, suivant le vieil ordre en Europe établi,
  L'empereur d'Allemagne est duc, le roi de France
  Marquis; les autres rois ont peu de différence;
  Ils sont barons autour de Rome, leur pilier,
  Et le roi de Pologne est simple chevalier;
  Mais dans ce siècle on voit l'exception unique
  Du roi sarmate égal au césar germanique.
  Chacun s'est fait sa part; l'Allemand n'a qu'un soin,
  Il prend tous les pays de terre ferme au loin;
  Le Polonais, ayant le rivage baltique,
  Veut des ports, il a pris toute la mer Celtique,
  Sur tous les flots du nord il pousse ses dromons,
  L'Islande voit passer ses navires démons;
  L'Allemand brûle Anvers et conquiert les deux Prusses,
  Le Polonais secourt Spotocus, duc des Russes,
  Comme un plus grand boucher en aide un plus petit;
  Le roi prend, l'empereur pille, usurpe, investit;
  L'empereur fait la guerre à l'ordre teutonique,
  Le roi sur le Jutland pose son pied cynique;
  Mais, qu'ils brisent le faible ou qu'ils trompent le fort,
  Quoi qu'ils fassent, ils ont pour loi d'être d'accord;
  Des geysers du pôle aux cités transalpines,
  Leurs ongles monstrueux, crispés sur des rapines,
  Égratignent le pâle et triste continent.
  Et tout leur réussit. Chacun d'eux, rayonnant,
  Mène à fin tous ses plans lâches ou téméraires,
  Et règne; et, sous Satan paternel, ils sont frères;
  Ils s'aiment; l'un est fourbe et l'autre est déloyal,
  Ils sont les deux bandits du grand chemin royal.
  O les noirs conquérants! et quelle oeuvre éphémère!
  L'ambition, branlant ses têtes de chimère,
  Sous leur crâne brumeux, fétide et sans clarté,
  Nourrit la pourriture et la stérilité;
  Ce qu'ils font est néant et cendre; une hydre allaite,
  Dans leur âme nocturne et profonde, un squelette.
  Le Polonais sournois, l'Allemand hasardeux,
  Remarquent qu'à cette heure une femme est près d'eux;
  Tous deux guettent Mahaud. Et naguère avec rage,
  De sa bouche qu'empourpre une lueur d'orage
  Et d'où sortent des mots pleins d'ombre et teints de sang,
  L'empereur a jeté cet éclair menaçant:
  --L'empire est las d'avoir au dos cette besace
  Qu'on appelle la haute et la basse Lusace,
  Et dont la pesanteur, qui nous met sur les dents,
  S'accroît quand par hasard une femme est dedans.--
  Le Polonais se tait, épie et patiente.

  Ce sont deux grands dangers; mais cette insouciante
  Sourit, gazouille et danse, aime les doux propos,
  Se fait bénir du pauvre et réduit les impôts;
  Elle est vive, coquette, aimable et bijoutière;
  Elle est femme toujours; dans sa couronne altière,
  Elle choisit la perle, elle a peur du fleuron;
  Car le fleuron tranchant, c'est l'homme et le baron.
  Elle a des tribunaux d'amour qu'elle préside;
  Aux copistes d'Homère elle paye un subside;
  Elle a tout récemment accueilli dans sa cour
  Deux hommes, un luthier avec un troubadour,
  Dont on ignore tout, le nom, le rang, la race,
  Mais qui, conteurs charmants, le soir, sur la terrasse,
  A l'heure où les vitraux aux brises sont ouverts,
  Lui font de la musique et lui disent des vers.

  Or, en juin, la Lusace, en août, les Moraves,
  Font la fête du trône et sacrent leurs margraves:
  C'est aujourd'hui le jour du burg mystérieux;
  Mahaud viendra ce soir souper chez ses aïeux.

  Qu'est-ce que tout cela fait à l'herbe des plaines,
  Aux oiseaux, à la fleur, au nuage, aux fontaines?
  Qu'est-ce que tout cela fait aux arbres des bois,
  Que le peuple ait des jougs et que l'homme ait des rois?
  L'eau coule, le vent passe, et murmure: Qu'importe?

LA SALLE À MANGER

  La salle est gigantesque; elle n'a qu'une porte;
  Le mur fuit dans la brume et semble illimité;
  En face de la porte, à l'autre extrémité,
  Brille, étrange et splendide, une table adossée
  Au fond de ce livide et froid rez-de-chaussée;
  La salle a pour plafond les charpentes du toit;
  Cette table n'attend qu'un convive; on n'y voit
  Qu'un fauteuil, sous un dais qui pend aux poutres noires;
  Les anciens temps ont peint sur le mur leurs histoires,
  Le fier combat du roi des Vendes Thassilo
  Contre Nemrod sur terre et Neptune sur l'eau,
  Le fleuve Rhin trahi par la rivière Meuse,
  Et, groupes blêmissants sur la paroi brumeuse,
  Odin, le loup Fenris et le serpent Asgar;
  Et toute la lumière éclairant ce hangar,
  Qui semble d'un dragon avoir été l'étable,
  Vient d'un flambeau sinistre allumé sur la table;
  C'est le grand chandelier aux sept branches de fer
  Que l'archange Attila rapporta de l'enfer
  Après qu'il eut vaincu le Mammon, et sept âmes
  Furent du noir flambeau les sept premières flammes.
  Toute la salle semble un grand linéament
  D'abîme, modelé dans l'ombre vaguement;
  Au fond, la table éclate avec la brusquerie
  De la clarté heurtant des blocs d'orfèvrerie;
  De beaux faisans tués par les traîtres faucons,
  Des viandes froides, force aiguières et flacons
  Chargent la table où s'offre une opulente agape.
  Les plats bordés de fleurs sont en vermeil; la nappe
  Vient de Frise, pays célèbre par ses draps;
  Et, pour les fruits, brugnons, fraises, pommes, cédrats,
  Les pâtres de la Murg ont sculpté les sébiles
  Ces orfèvres du bois sont des rustres habiles
  Qui font sur une écuelle ondoyer des jardins
  Et des monts où l'on voit fuir des chasses aux daims;
  Sur une vasque d'or aux anses florentines,
  Des Actéons cornus et chaussés de bottines
  Luttent, l'épée au poing, contre des lévriers;
  Des branches de glaïeuls et de genévriers,
  Des roses, des bouquets d'anis, une jonchée
  De sauge tout en fleur nouvellement fauchée,
  Couvrent d'un frais parfum de printemps répandu
  Un tapis d'Ispahan sous la table étendu.
  Dehors, c'est la ruine et c'est la solitude.
  On entend, dans sa rauque et vaste inquiétude,
  Passer sur le hallier par l'été rajeuni
  Le vent, onde de l'ombre et flot de l'infini.
  On a remis partout des vitres aux verrières
  Qu'ébranle la rafale arrivant des clairières;
  L'étrange dans ce lieu ténébreux et rêvant,
  Ce serait que celui qu'on attend fût vivant;
  Aux lueurs du sept-bras, qui fait flamboyer presque
  Les vagues yeux épars sur la lugubre fresque,
  On voit le long des murs, par place, un escabeau,
  Quelque long coffre obscur à meubler le tombeau,
  Et des buffets chargés de cuivre et de faïence;
  Et la porte, effrayante et sombre confiance,
  Est formidablement ouverte sur la nuit.
  Rien ne parle en ce lieu d'où tout homme s'enfuit.
  La terreur, dans les coins accroupie, attend l'hôte.
  Cette salle à manger de titans est si haute,
  Qu'en égarant, de poutre en poutre, son regard
  Aux étages confus de ce plafond hagard,
  On est presque étonné de n'y pas voir d'étoiles.
  L'araignée est géante en ces hideuses toiles
  Flottant, là-haut, parmi les madriers profonds
  Que mordent aux deux bouts les gueules des griffons.
  La lumière a l'air noire et la salle a l'air morte.
  La nuit retient son souffle. On dirait que la porte
  A peur de remuer tout haut ses deux battants.


VIII

CE QU'ON Y VOIT ENCORE

  Mais ce que cette salle, antre obscur des vieux temps,
  A de plus sépulcral et de plus redoutable,
  Ce n'est pas le flambeau, ni le dais, ni la table;
  C'est, le long de deux rangs d'arches et de piliers,
  Deux files de chevaux avec leurs chevaliers.

  Chacun à son pilier s'adosse et tient sa lance;
  L'arme droite, ils se font vis-à-vis en silence;
  Les chanfreins sont lacés; les harnais sont bouclés;
  Les chatons des cuissards sont barrés de leurs clés;
  Les trousseaux de poignards sur l'arçon se répandent;
  Jusqu'aux pieds des chevaux les caparaçons pendent;
  Les cuirs sont agrafés; les ardillons d'airain
  Attachent l'éperon, serrent le gorgerin;
  La grande épée à mains brille au croc de la selle;
  La hache est sur le dos, la dague est sous l'aisselle;
  Les genouillères ont leur boutoir meurtrier,
  Les mains pressent la bride et les pieds l'étrier;
  Ils sont prêts; chaque heaume est masqué de son crible;
  Tous se taisent; pas un ne bouge; c'est terrible.

  Les chevaux monstrueux ont la corne au frontail;
  Si Satan est berger, c'est là son noir bétail.
  Pour en voir de pareils dans l'ombre, il faut qu'on dorme;
  Ils sont comme engloutis sous la housse difforme;
  Les cavaliers sont froids, calmes, graves, armés,
  Effroyables; les poings lugubrement fermés;
  Si l'enfer tout à coup ouvrait ces mains fantômes.
  On verrait quelque lettre affreuse dans leurs paumes.
  De la brume du lieu leur stature s'accroît.
  Autour d'eux l'ombre a peur et les piliers ont froid.
  O nuit, qu'est-ce que c'est que ces guerriers livides?

  Chevaux et chevaliers sont des armures vides,
  Mais debout. Ils ont tous encor le geste fier,
  L'air fauve, et, quoique étant de l'ombre, ils sont du fer.
  Sont-ce des larves?  Non; et sont-ce des statues?
  Non. C'est de la chimère et de l'horreur, vêtues
  D'airain, et, des bas-fonds de ce monde puni,
  Faisant une menace obscure à l'infini;
  Devant cette impassible et morne chevauchée,
  L'âme tremble et se sent des spectres approchée,
  Comme si l'on voyait la halte des marcheurs
  Mystérieux que l'aube efface en ses blancheurs.
  Si quelqu'un, à cette heure, osait franchir la porte,
  A voir se regarder ces masques de la sorte,
  Il croirait que la mort, à de certains moments,
  Rhabillant l'homme, ouvrant les sépulcres dormants,
  Ordonne, hors du temps, de l'espace et du nombre,
  Des confrontations de fantômes dans l'ombre.

  Les linceuls ne sont pas plus noirs que ces armets;
  Les tombeaux, quoique sourds et voilés pour jamais,
  Ne sont pas plus glacés que ces brassards; les bières
  N'ont pas leurs ais hideux mieux joints que ces jambières;
  Le casque semble un crâne, et, de squames couverts,
  Les doigts des gantelets luisent comme des vers;
  Ces robes de combat ont des plis de suaires;
  Ces pieds pétrifiés siéraient aux ossuaires;
  Ces piques ont des bois lourds et vertigineux
  Où des têtes de mort s'ébauchent dans les noeuds.
  Ils sont tous arrogants sur la selle, et leurs bustes
  Achèvent les poitrails des destriers robustes;
  Les mailles sur leurs flancs croisent leurs durs tricots;
  Le mortier des marquis près des tortils ducaux
  Rayonne, et sur l'écu, le casque et la rondache,
  La perle triple alterne avec les feuilles d'ache;
  La chemise de guerre et le manteau de roi
  Sont si larges qu'ils vont du maître au palefroi;
  Les plus anciens harnais remontent jusqu'à Rome;
  L'armure du cheval sous l'armure de l'homme
  Vit d'une vie horrible, et guerrier et coursier
  Ne font qu'une seule hydre aux écailles d'acier.

  L'histoire est là; ce sont toutes les panoplies
  Par qui furent jadis tant d'oeuvres accomplies;
  Chacune, avec son timbre en forme de delta,
  Semble la vision du chef qui la porta;
  Là sont des ducs sanglants et les marquis sauvages
  Qui portaient pour pennons au milieu des ravages
  Des saints dorés et peints sur des peaux de poissons.
  Voici Geth, qui criait aux Slaves: Avançons!
  Mundiaque, Ottocar, Platon, Ladislas Cunne,
  Welf, dont l'écu portait: 'Ma peur se nomme Aucune.'
  Zultan, Nazamystus, Othon le Chassieux;
  Depuis Spignus jusqu'à Spartibor aux trois yeux,
  Toute la dynastie effrayante d'Antée
  Semble là sur le bord des siècles arrêtée.

  Que font-ils là, debout et droits? Qu'attendent-ils?
  L'aveuglement remplit l'armet aux durs sourcils.
  L'arbre est là sans la sève et le héros sans l'âme;
  Où l'on voit des yeux d'ombre on vit des yeux de flamme;
  La visière aux trous ronds sert de masque au néant;
  Le vide s'est fait spectre et rien s'est fait géant;
  Et chacun de ces hauts cavaliers est l'écorce
  De l'orgueil, du défi, du meurtre et de la force;
  Le sépulcre glacé les tient; la rouille mord
  Ces grands casques épris d'aventure et de mort,
  Que baisait leur maîtresse auguste, la bannière;
  Pas un brassard ne peut remuer sa charnière;
  Les voilà tous muets, eux qui rugissaient tous,
  Et, grondant et grinçant, rendaient les clairons fous;
  Le heaume affreux n'a plus de cri dans ses gencives;
  Ces armures, jadis fauves et convulsives,
  Ces hauberts, autrefois pleins d'un souffle irrité,
  Sont venus s'échouer dans l'immobilité,
  Regarder devant eux l'ombre qui se prolonge,
  Et prendre dans la nuit la figure du songe.

  Ces deux files, qui vont depuis le morne seuil
  Jusqu'au fond où l'on voit la table et le fauteuil,
  Laissent entre leurs fronts une ruelle étroite;
  Les marquis sont à gauche et les ducs sont à droite;
  Jusqu'au jour où le toit que Spignus crénela,
  Chargé d'ans, croulera sur leur tête, ils sont là,
  Inégaux face à face, et pareils côte à côte.
  En dehors des deux rangs, en avant, tête haute,
  Comme pour commander le funèbre escadron
  Qu'éveillera le bruit du suprême clairon,
  Les vieux sculpteurs ont mis un cavalier de pierre,
  Charlemagne, ce roi qui de toute la terre
  Fit une table ronde à douze chevaliers.

  Les cimiers surprenants, tragiques, singuliers,
  Cauchemars entrevus dans le sommeil sans bornes,
  Sirènes aux seins nus, mélusines, licornes,
  Farouches bois de cerfs, aspics, alérions,
  Sur la rigidité des pâles morions,
  Semblent une forêt de monstres qui végète;
  L'un penche en avant, l'autre en arrière se jette;
  Tous ces êtres, dragons, cerbères orageux,
  Que le bronze et le rêve ont créés dans leurs jeux,
  Lions volants, serpents ailés, guivres palmées,
  Faits pour l'effarement des livides armées,
  Espèces de démons composés de terreur,
  Qui sur le heaume altier des barons en fureur
  Hurlaient, accompagnant la bannière géante,
  Sur les cimiers glacés songent, gueule béante,
  Comme s'ils s'ennuyaient, trouvant les siècles longs;
  Et, regrettant les morts saignant sous les talons,
  Les trompettes, la poudre immense, la bataille,
  Le carnage, on dirait que l'Épouvante bâille.
  Le métal fait reluire, en reflets durs et froids,
  Sa grande larme au mufle obscur des palefrois;
  De ces spectres pensifs l'odeur des temps s'exhale;
  Leur ombre est formidable au plafond de la salle;
  Aux lueurs du flambeau frissonnant, au-dessus
  Des blêmes cavaliers vaguement aperçus,
  Elle remue et croît dans les ténébreux faîtes;
  Et la double rangée horrible de ces têtes
  Fait, dans l'énormité des vieux combles fuyants,
  De grands nuages noirs aux profils effrayants.

  Et tout est fixe, et pas un coursier ne se cabre
  Dans cette légion de la guerre macabre;
  Oh! ces hommes masqués sur ces chevaux voilés,
  Chose affreuse!

                    A la brume éternelle mêlés,
  Ayant chez les vivants fini leur tâche austère,
  Muets, ils sont tournés du côté du mystère;
  Ces sphinx ont l'air, au seuil du gouffre où rien ne luit,
  De regarder l'énigme en face dans la nuit,
  Comme si, prêts à faire, entre les bleus pilastres,
  Sous leurs sabots d'acier étinceler les astres,
  Voulant pour cirque l'ombre, ils provoquaient d'en bas,
  Peur on ne sait quels fiers et funèbres combats,
  Dans le champ sombre où n'ose aborder la pensée,
  La sinistre visière au fond des cieux baissée.

BRUIT QUE FAIT LE PLANCHER

  C'est là qu'Éviradnus entre; Gasclin le suit.

  Le mur d'enceinte étant presque partout détruit,
  Cette porte, ancien seuil des marquis patriarches
  Qu'au-dessus de la cour exhaussent quelques marches,
  Domine l'horizon, et toute la forêt
  Autour de son perron comme un gouffre apparaît.
  L'épaisseur du vieux roc de Corbus est propice
  A cacher plus d'un sourd et sanglant précipice;
  Tout le burg, et la salle elle-même, dit-on,
  Sont bâtis sur des puits faits par le duc Platon;
  Le plancher sonne; on sent au-dessous des abîmes.

  --Page, dit ce chercheur d'aventures sublimes,
  Viens. Tu vois mieux que moi, qui n'ai plus de bons yeux,
  Car la lumière est femme et se refuse aux vieux;
  Bah! voit toujours assez qui regarde en arrière.
  On découvre d'ici la route et la clairière;
  Garçon, vois-tu là-bas venir quelqu'un?--Gasclin
  Se penche hors du seuil; la lune est dans son plein,
  D'une blanche lueur la clairière est baignée.
  --Une femme à cheval. Elle est accompagnée.
  --De qui? Gasclin répond:--Seigneur, j'entends les voix
  De deux hommes parlant et riant, et je vois
  Trois ombres de chevaux qui passent sur la route.
  --Bien, dit Éviradnus. Ce sont eux. Page, écoute.
  Tu vas partir d'ici. Prends un autre chemin.
  Va-t'en sans être vu. Tu reviendras demain
  Avec nos deux chevaux, frais, en bon équipage,
  Au point du jour. C'est dit. Laisse-moi seul.--Le page,
  Regardant son bon maître avec des yeux de fils,
  Dit:--Si je demeurais? Ils sont deux.--Je suffis.
  Va.

ÉVIRADNUS IMMOBILE

      Le héros est seul sous ces grands murs sévères.
  Il s'approche un moment de la table où les verres
  Et les hanaps, dorés et peints, petits et grands,
  Sont étagés, divers pour les vins différents;
  Il a soif; les flacons tentent sa lèvre avide;
  Mais la goutte qui reste au fond d'un verre vide
  Trahirait que quelqu'un dans la salle est vivant;
  Il va droit aux chevaux. Il s'arrête devant
  Celui qui le plus près de la table étincelle,
  Il prend le cavalier et l'arrache à la selle;
  La panoplie en vain lui jette un pâle éclair,
  Il saisit corps à corps le fantôme de fer,
  Et l'emporte au plus noir de la salle; et, pliée
  Dans la cendre et la nuit, l'armure humiliée
  Reste adossée au mur comme un héros vaincu;
  Éviradnus lui prend sa lance et son écu,
  Monte en selle à sa place, et le voilà statue.

  Pareil aux autres, froid, la visière abattue,
  On n'entend pas un souffle à sa lèvre échapper,
  Et le tombeau pourrait lui-même s'y tromper.

  Tout est silencieux dans la salle terrible.



XI

UN PEU DE MUSIQUE

  Écoutez!--Comme un nid qui murmure invisible,
  Un bruit confus s'approche, et des rires, des voix,
  Des pas, sortent du fond vertigineux des bois.

  Et voici qu'à travers la grande forêt brune
  Qu'emplit la rêverie immense de la lune,
  On entend frissonner et vibrer mollement,
  Communiquant au bois son doux frémissement,
  La guitare des monts d'Inspruck, reconnaissable
  Au grelot de son manche où sonne un grain de sable;
  Il s'y mêle la voix d'un homme, et ce frisson
  Prend un sens et devient une vague chanson.

      'Si tu veux, faisons un rêve.
      Montons sur deux palefrois;
      Tu m'emmènes, je t'enlève.
      L'oiseau chante dans les bois.

      'Je suis ton maître et ta proie;
      Partons, c'est la fin du jour;
      Mon cheval sera la joie,
      Ton cheval sera l'amour.

      'Nous ferons toucher leurs têtes;
      Les voyages sont aisés;
      Nous donnerons à ces bêtes
      Une avoine de baisers.

      'Viens! nos doux chevaux mensonges
      Frappent du pied tous les deux,
      Le mien au fond de mes songes,
      Et le tien au fond des cieux.

      'Un bagage est nécessaire;
      Nous emporterons nos voeux,
      Nos bonheurs, notre misère,
      Et la fleur de tes cheveux.

      'Viens, le soir brunit les chênes,
      Le moineau rit; ce moqueur
      Entend le doux bruit des chaînes
      Que tu m'as mises au coeur.

      'Ce ne sera point ma faute
      Si les forêts et les monts,
      En nous voyant côte à côte,
      Ne murmurent pas: Aimons!

      'Viens, sois tendre, je suis ivre.
      O les verts taillis mouillés!
      Ton souffle te fera suivre
      Des papillons réveillés.

      'L'envieux oiseau nocturne,
      Triste, ouvrira son oeil rond;
      Les nymphes, penchant leur urne,
      Dans les grottes souriront.

      'Et diront: "Sommes-nous folles!
      C'est Léandre avec Héro;
      En écoutant leurs paroles
      Nous laissons tomber notre eau."

      'Allons-nous-en par l'Autriche!
      Nous aurons l'aube à nos fronts;
      Je serai grand, et toi riche,
      Puisque nous nous aimerons.

      'Allons-nous-en par la terre,
      Sur nos deux chevaux charmants,
      Dans l'azur, dans le mystère,
      Dans les éblouissements!

      'Nous entrerons à l'auberge,
      Et nous payerons l'hôtelier
      De ton sourire de vierge,
      De mon bonjour d'écolier.

      'Tu seras dame, et moi comte;
      Viens, mon coeur s'épanouit,
      Viens, nous conterons ce conte
      Aux étoiles de la nuit.'

  La mélodie encor quelques instants se traîne
  Sous les arbres bleuis par la lune sereine,
  Puis tremble, puis expire, et la voix qui chantait
  S'éteint comme un oiseau se pose; tout se tait.

LE GRAND JOSS ET LE PETIT ZÉNO

  Soudain, au seuil lugubre apparaissent trois têtes
  Joyeuses, et d'où sort une lueur de fêtes;
  Deux hommes, une femme en robe de drap d'or.
  L'un des hommes paraît trente ans; l'autre est encor
  Plus jeune, et sur son dos il porte en bandoulière
  La guitare où s'enlace une branche de lierre;
  Il est grand et blond; l'autre est petit, pâle et brun;
  Ces hommes, qu'on dirait faits d'ombre et de parfum,
  Sont beaux, mais le démon dans leur beauté grimace;
  Avril a de ces fleurs où rampe une limace.

  --Mon grand Joss, mon petit Zéno, venez ici.
  Voyez. C'est effrayant.

                        Celle qui parle ainsi
  C'est madame Mahaud; le clair de lune semble
  Caresser sa beauté qui rayonne et qui tremble,
  Comme si ce doux être était de ceux que l'air
  Crée, apporte et remporte en un céleste éclair.

  --Passer ici la nuit!  Certe, un trône s'achète!
  Si vous n'étiez venus m'escorter en cachette,
  Dit-elle, je serais vraiment morte de peur.

  La lune éclaire auprès du seuil, dans la vapeur,
  Un des grands chevaliers adossés aux murailles.

  --Comme je vous vendrais à l'encan ces ferrailles!
  Dit Zéno; je ferais, si j'étais le marquis,
  De ce tas de vieux clous sortir des vins exquis,
  Des galas, des tournois, des bouffons, et des femmes.

  Et, frappant cet airain d'où sort le bruit des âmes,
  Cette armure où l'on voit frémir le gantelet,
  Calme et riant, il donne au sépulcre un soufflet.

  --Laissez donc mes aïeux, dit Mahaud qui murmure.
  Vous êtes trop petit pour toucher cette armure.

  Zéno pâlit. Mais Joss:--ça, des aïeux! J'en ris.
  Tous ces bonshommes noirs sont des nids de souris.
  Pardieu! pendant qu'ils ont l'air terrible, et qu'ils songent,
  Écoutez, on entend le bruit des dents qui rongent.
  Et dire qu'en effet autrefois tout cela
  S'appelait Ottocar, Othon, Platon, Bela!
  Hélas! la fin n'est pas plaisante, et déconcerte.
  Soyez donc ducs et rois! Je ne voudrais pas, certe,
  Avoir été colosse, avoir été héros,
  Madame, avoir empli de morts des tombereaux,
  Pour que, sous ma farouche et fière bourguignotte,
  Moi, prince et spectre, un rat paisible me grignote!

  --C'est que ce n'est point là votre état, dit Mahaud.
  Chantez, soit; mais ici ne parlez pas trop haut.

  --Bien dit, reprit Zéno. C'est un lieu de prodiges.
  Et, quant à moi, je vois des serpentes, des striges,
  Tout un fourmillement de monstres, s'ébaucher
  Dans la brume qui sort des fentes du plancher.

  Mahaud frémit.

               --Ce vin que l'abbé m'a fait boire
  Va bientôt m'endormir d'une façon très noire;
  Jurez-moi de rester près de moi.

                                  --J'en réponds,
  Dit Joss; et Zéno dit:--Je le jure. Soupons.


XIII

ILS SOUPENT

  Et, riant et chantant, ils s'en vont vers la table.

  --Je fais Joss chambellan et Zéno connétable,
  Dit Mahaud. Et tous trois causent, joyeux et beaux,
  Elle sur le fauteuil, eux sur des escabeaux;
  Joss mange, Zéno boit, Mahaud rêve. La feuille
  N'a pas de bruit distinct qu'on note et qu'on recueille,
  Ainsi va le babil sans force et sans lien;
  Joss par moments fredonne un chant tyrolien,
  Et fait rire ou pleurer la guitare; les contes
  Se mêlent aux gaîtés fraîches, vives et promptes.
  Mahaud dit:--Savez-vous que vous êtes heureux?
  --Nous sommes bien portants, jeunes, fous, amoureux,
  C'est vrai.--De plus, tu sais le latin comme un prêtre,
  Et Joss chante fort bien.--Oui, nous avons un maître
  Qui nous donne cela par-dessus le marché.
  --Quel est son nom?--Pour nous Satan, pour vous Péché,
  Dit Zéno, caressant jusqu'en sa raillerie.
  --Ne riez pas ainsi, je ne veux pas qu'on rie.
  Paix, Zéno! Parle-moi, toi, Joss, mon chambellan.
  --Madame, Viridis, comtesse de Milan,
  Fut superbe; Diane éblouissait le pâtre;
  Aspasie, Isabeau de Saxe, Cléopâtre,
  Sont des noms devant qui la louange se tait;
  Rhodope fut divine; Érylésis était
  Si belle, que Vénus, jalouse de sa gorge,
  La traîna toute nue en la céleste forge
  Et la fit sur l'enclume écraser par Vulcain;
  Eh bien! autant l'étoile éclipse le sequin,
  Autant le temple éclipse un monceau de décombres,
  Autant vous effacez toutes ces belles ombres!
  Ces coquettes qui font des mines dans l'azur,
  Les elfes, les péris, ont le front jeune et pur
  Moins que vous, et pourtant le vent et ses bouffées
  Les ont galamment d'ombre et de rayons coiffées.
  --Flatteur, tu chantes bien, dit Mahaud. Joss reprend:
  --Si j'étais, sous le ciel splendide et transparent,
  Ange, fille ou démon, s'il fallait que j'apprisse
  La grâce, la gaîté, le rire et le caprice,
  Altesse, je viendrais à l'école chez vous.
  Vous êtes une fée aux yeux divins et doux,
  Ayant pour un vil sceptre échangé sa baguette--
  Mahaud songe:--On dirait que ton regard me guette,
  Tais-toi. Voyons, de vous tout ce que je connais,
  C'est que Joss est Bohême et Zéno Polonais,
  Mais vous êtes charmants; et pauvres, oui, vous l'êtes;
  Moi, je suis riche; eh bien! demandez-moi, poètes,
  Tout ce que vous voudrez.--Tout! Je vous prends au mot,
  Répond Joss. Un baiser.--Un baiser!  dit Mahaud
  Surprise en ce chanteur d'une telle pensée,
  Savez-vous qui je suis?--Et fière et courroucée,
  Elle rougit. Mais Joss n'est pas intimidé.
  --Si je ne la savais, aurais-je demandé
  Une faveur qu'il faut qu'on obtienne, ou qu'on prenne!
  Il n'est don que de roi ni baiser que de reine.
  --Reine! et Mahaud sourit.


XIV

APRÈS SOUPER

                          Cependant, par degrés,
  Le narcotique éteint ses yeux d'ombre enivrés;
  Zéno l'observe, un doigt sur la bouche; elle penche
  La tête, et, souriant, s'endort, sereine et blanche.

  Zéno lui prend la main qui retombe.

                                     --Elle dort!
  Dit Zéno; maintenant, vite, tirons au sort.
  D'abord, à qui l'état? Ensuite, à qui la fille?

  Dans ces deux profils d'homme un oeil de tigre brille.

  --Frère, dit Joss, parlons politique à présent.
  La Mahaud dort et fait quelque rêve innocent;
  Nos griffes sont dessus. Nous avons cette folle.
  L'ami de dessous terre est sûr et tient parole;
  Le hasard, grâce à lui, ne nous a rien ôté
  De ce que nous avons construit et comploté;
  Tout nous a réussi. Pas de puissance humaine
  Qui nous puisse arracher la femme et le domaine.
  Concluons. Guerroyer, se chamailler pour rien,
  Pour un oui, pour un non, pour un dogme arien
  Dont le pape sournois rira dans la coulisse,
  Pour quelque fille ayant une peau fraîche et lisse,
  Des yeux bleus et des mains blanches comme le lait,
  C'était bon dans le temps où l'on se querellait
  Pour la croix byzantine ou pour la croix latine,
  Et quand Pépin tenait une synode à Leptine,
  Et quand Rodolphe et Jean, comme deux hommes soùls,
  Glaive au poing, s'arrachaient leurs Agnès de deux sous;
  Aujourd'hui, tout est mieux et les moeurs sont plus douces,
  Frère, on ne se met plus ainsi la guerre aux trousses,
  Et l'on sait en amis régler un différend;
  As-tu des dés?

               --J'en ai.

                       --Celui qui gagne prend
  Le marquisat; celui qui perd a la marquise.

  --Bien

          --J'entends du bruit

                         --Non, dit Zéno, c'est la bise
  Qui souffle bêtement et qu'on prend pour quelqu'un.
  As-tu peur?

  --Je n'ai peur de rien, que d'être à jeun,
  Répond Joss, et sur moi que les gouffres s'écroulent!

  --Finissons. Que le sort décide.

                                 Les dés roulent.

  --Quatre.

          Joss prend les dés.

                             --Six. Je gagne tout net,
  J'ai trouvé la Lusace au fond de ce cornet.
  Dês demain, j'entre en danse avec tout mon orchestre.
  Taxes partout. Payez. La corde ou le séquestre,
  Des trompettes d'airain seront mes galoubets.
  Les impôts, cela pousse en plantant des gibets.

  Zéno dit: J'ai la fille. Eh bien! je le préfère.

  --Elle est belle, dit Joss.

                           --Pardieu!

                                 --Qu'en vas-tu faire?

  --Un cadavre.

               Et Zéno reprend:

                               --En vérité,
  La créature m'a tout à l'heure insulté.
  Petit! voilà le mot qu'a dit cette femelle.
  Si l'enfer m'eût crié, béant sous ma semelle,
  Dans la sombre minute où je tenais les dés:
  'Fils, les hasards ne sont pas encor décidés;
  Je t'offre le gros lot, la Lusace aux sept villes;
  Je t'offre dix pays de blés, de vins et d'huiles,
  A ton choix, ayant tous leur peuple diligent;
  Je t'offre la Bohême et ses mines d'argent,
  Ce pays le plus haut du monde, ce grand antre
  D'où plus d'un fleuve sort, où pas un ruisseau n'entre;
  Je t'offre le Tyrol aux monts d'azur remplis,
  Et je t'offre la France avec les fleurs de lis;
  Qu'est-ce que tu choisis?'  J'aurais dit: 'La vengeance.'
  Et j'aurais dit: 'Enfer, plutôt que cette France,
  Et que cette Bohême, et ce Tyrol si beau,
  Mets à mes ordres l'ombre et les vers du tombeau!'
  Mon frère, cette femme, absurdement marquise
  D'une marche terrible où tout le nord se brise,
  Et qui, dans tous les cas, est pour nous un danger,
  Ayant été stupide au point de m'outrager,
  Il convient qu'elle meure; et puis, s'il faut tout dire,
  Je l'aime; et la lueur que de mon coeur je tire,
  Je la tire du tien; tu l'aimes aussi, toi.
  Frère, en faisant ici, chacun dans notre emploi,
  Les Bohèmes pour mettre à fin cette équipée,
  Nous sommes devenus, près de cette poupée,
  Niais, toi comme un page, et moi comme un barbon,
  Et, de galants pour rire, amoureux pour de bon;
  Oui, nous sommes tous deux épris de cette femme;
  Or, frère, elle serait entre nous une flamme;
  Tôt ou tard, et malgré le bien que je te veux,
  Elle nous mènerait à nous prendre aux cheveux;
  Vois-tu, nous finirions par rompre notre pacte,
  Nous l'aimons. Tuons-la.

                        --Ta logique est exacte,
  Dit Joss rêveur; mais quoi!  du sang ici?

                                            Zéno
  Pousse un coin de tapis, tâte et prend un anneau,
  Le tire, et le plancher se soulève; un abîme
  S'ouvre; il en sort de l'ombre ayant l'odeur du crime;
  Joss marche vers la trappe, et, les yeux dans les yeux,
  Zéno muet la montre à Joss silencieux;
  Joss se penche, approuvant de la tête le gouffre.


XV

LES OUBLIETTES

  S'il sortait de ce puits une lueur de soufre,
  On dirait une bouche obscure de l'enfer.
  La trappe est large assez pour qu'en un brusque éclair
  L'homme étonné qu'on pousse y tombe à la renverse;
  On distingue les dents sinistres d'une herse,
  Et, plus bas, le regard flotte dans de la nuit;
  Le sang sur les parois fait un rougeâtre enduit;
  L'Épouvante est au fond de ce puits toute nue;
  On sent qu'il pourrit là de l'histoire inconnue,
  Et que ce vieux sépulcre, oublié maintenant,
  Cuve du meurtre, est plein de larves se traînant,
  D'ombres tâtant le mur et de spectres reptiles.
  --Nos aïeux ont parfois fait des choses utiles,
  Dit Joss. Et Zéno dit:--Je connais le château;
  Ce que le mont Corbus cache sous son manteau,
  Nous le savons, l'orfraie et moi; cette bâtisse
  Est vieille; on y rendait autrefois la justice.

  --Es-tu sûr que Mahaud ne se réveille point?

  --Son oeil est clos ainsi que je ferme mon poing;
  Elle dort d'une sorte âpre et surnaturelle,
  L'obscure volonté du philtre étant sur elle.

  --Elle s'éveillera demain au point du jour.

  --Dans l'ombre.

                --Et que va dire ici toute la cour,
  Quand au lieu d'une femme ils trouveront deux hommes?

  --Tous se prosterneront en sachant qui nous sommes!

  --Où va cette oubliette?

                         --Aux torrents, aux corbeaux,
  Au néant; finissons.

                       Ces hommes, jeunes, beaux,
  Charmants, sont à présent difformes, tant s'efface
  Sous la noirceur du coeur le rayon de la face,
  Tant l'homme est transparent â l'enfer qui l'emplit.
  Ils s'approchent; Mahaud dort comme dans un lit.

  --Allons!

           Joss la saisit sous les bras, et dépose
  Un baiser monstrueux sur cette bouche rose;
  Zéno, penché devant le grand fauteuil massif,
  Prend ses pieds endormis et charmants; et, lascif,
  Lève la robe d'or jusqu'à la jarretière.

  Le puits, comme une fosse au fond d'un cimetière,
  Est là béant.



XVI

CE QU'ILS FONT DEVIENT PLUS DIFFICILE Á FAIRE

                    Portant Mahaud, qui dort toujours,
  Ils marchent lents, courbés, en silence, à pas lourds,
  Zéno tourné vers l'ombre et Joss vers la lumière;
  La salle aux yeux de Joss apparaît tout entière;
  Tout à coup il s'arrête, et Zéno dit:--Eh bien?
  Mais Joss est effrayant; pâle, il ne répond rien,
  Et fait signe à Zéno, qui regarde en arrière...
  Tous deux semblent changés en deux spectres de pierre
  Car tous deux peuvent voir, là, sous un cintre obscur,
  Un des grands chevaliers rangés le long du mur
  Qui se lève et descend de cheval; ce fantôme,
  Tranquille sous le masque horrible de son heaume,
  Vient vers eux, et son pas fait trembler le plancher;
  On croit entendre un dieu de l'abîme marcher;
  Entre eux et l'oubliette il vient barrer l'espace,
  Et dit, le glaive haut et la visière basse,
  D'une voix sépulcrale et lente comme un glas:
  --Arrête, Sigismond!  Arrête, Ladislas!
  Tous deux laissent tomber la marquise, de sorte
  Qu'elle gît à leurs pieds et paraît une morte.

  La voix de fer parlant sous le grillage noir
  Reprend, pendant que Joss blêmit, lugubre à voir,
  Et que Zério chancelle ainsi qu'un mât qui sombre:

  --Hommes qui m'écoutez, il est un pacte sombre
  Dont tout l'univers parle et que vous connaissez;
  Le voici: 'Moi, Satan, dieu des cieux éclipsés,
  Roi des jours ténébreux, prince des vents contraires,
  Je contracte alliance avec mes deux bons frères,
  L'empereur Sigismond et le roi Ladislas;
  Sans jamais m'absenter ni dire: je suis las,
  Je les protégerai dans toute conjoncture;
  De plus, je cède, en libre et pleine investiture,
  Étant seigneur de l'onde et souverain du mont,
  La mer à Ladislas, la terre à Sigismond,
  A la condition que, si je le réclame,
  Le roi m'offre sa tête et l'empereur son âme.'

  --Serait-ce lui? dit Joss. Spectre aux yeux fulgurants,
  Es-tu Satan?

               --Je suis plus et moins. Je ne prends
  Que vos têtes, ô rois des crimes et des trames,
  Laissant sous l'ongle noir se débattre vos âmes.

  Ils se regardent, fous, brisés, courbant le front,
  Et Zéno dit à Joss:--Hein! qu'est-ce que c'est donc?

  Joss bégaie:--Oui, la nuit nous tient. Pas de refuge.
  De quelle part viens-tu? Qu'es-tu, spectre?

                                            --Le juge.

  --Grâce!

          La voix reprend:

                         --Dieu conduit par la main
  Le vengeur en travers de votre affreux chemin;
  L'heure où vous existiez est une heure sonnée;
  Rien ne peut plus bouger dans votre destinée;
  L'idée inébranlable et calme est dans le joint.
  Oui, je vous regardais. Vous ne vous doutiez point
  Que vous aviez sur vous l'oeil fixe de la peine,
  Et que quelqu'un savait dans cette ombre malsaine
  Que Joss fût kaÿser et que Zéno fût roi.
  Vous venez de parler tout à l'heure, pourquoi?
  Tout est dit. Vos forfaits sont sur vous, incurables,
  N'espérez rien. Je suis l'abîme, ô misérables!
  Ah! Ladislas est roi, Sigismond est césar;
  Dieu n'est bon qu'à servir de roue à votre char;
  Toi, tu tiens la Pologne avec ses villes fortes;
  Toi, Milan t'a fait duc, Rome empereur, tu portes
  La couronne de fer et la couronne d'or;
  Toi, tu descends d'Hercule, et toi, de Spartibor;
  Vos deux tiares sont les deux lueurs du monde;
  Tous les monts de la terre et tous les flots de l'onde
  Ont, altiers ou tremblants, vos deux ombres sur eux;
  Vous êtes les jumeaux du grand vertige heureux;
  Vous avez la puissance et vous avez la gloire,
  Mais, sous ce ciel de pourpre et sous ce dais de moire,
  Sous cette inaccessible et haute dignité,
  Sous cet arc de triomphe au cintre illimité,
  Sous ce royal pouvoir, couvert de sacrés voiles,
  Sous ces couronnes, tas de perles et d'étoiles,
  Sous tous ces grands exploits, prompts, terribles, fougueux,
  Sigismond est un monstre et Ladislas un gueux!
  O dégradation du sceptre et de l'épée!
  Noire main de justice aux cloaques trempée!
  Devant l'hydre le seuil du temple ouvre ses gonds,
  Et le trône est un siège aux croupes des dragons!
  Siècle infâme! ô grand ciel étoilé, que de honte!
  Tout rampe; pas un front où le rouge ne monte,
  C'est égal, on se tait, et nul ne fait un pas.
  O peuple, million et million de bras,
  Toi, que tous ces rois-là mangent et déshonorent,
  Toi, que leurs majestés les vermines dévorent,
  Est-ce que tu n'as pas des ongles, vil troupeau,
  Pour ces démangeaisons d'empereurs sur ta peau!
  Du reste, en voilà deux de pris; deux âmes telles
  Que l'enfer même rêve étonné devant elles!
  Sigismond, Ladislas, vous étiez triomphants,
  Splendides, inouïs, prospères, étouffants;
  Le temps d'être punis arrive; à la bonne heure.
  Ah! le vautour larmoie et le caïman pleure.
  J'en ris. Je trouve bon qu'à-de certains instants
  Les princes, les heureux, les forts, les éclatants,
  Les vainqueurs, les puissants, tous les bandits suprêmes,
  A leurs fronts cerclés d'or, chargés de diadèmes,
  Sentent l'âpre sueur de Josaphat monter.
  Il est doux de voir ceux qui hurlaient sangloter.
  La peur après le crime; après l'affreux, l'immonde.
  C'est bien. Dieu tout puissant! quoi, des maîtres du monde,
  C'est ce que, dans la cendre et sous mes pieds, j'ai là!
  Quoi, ceci règne!  Quoi, c'est un césar, cela!
  En vérité, j'ai honte, et mon vieux coeur se serre
  De les voir se courber plus qu'il n'est nécessaire.
  Finissons. Ce qui vient de se passer ici,
  Princes veut un linceul promptement épaissi.
  Ces mêmes dés hideux qui virent le calvaire
  Ont roulé, dans mon ombre indignée et sévère,
  Sur une femme, après avoir roulé sur Dieu.
  Vous avez joué là rois un lugubre jeu.
  Mars, soit. Je ne vais pas perdre à de la morale
  Ce moment que remplit la brume sépulcrale.
  Vous ne voyez plus clair dans vos propres chemins,
  Et vos doigts ne sont plus assez des doigts humains
  Pour qu'ils puissent tâter vos actions funèbres;
  A quoi bon présenter le miroir aux ténèbres?
  A quoi bon vous parler de ce que vous faisiez?
  Boire de l'ombre, étant de nuit rassasiés,
  C'est ce que vous avez l'habitude de faire,
  Rois, au point de ne plus sentir dans votre verre
  L'odeur des attentats et le goût des forfaits.
  Je vous dis seulement que ce vil portefaix,
  Votre siècle, commence à trouver vos altesses
  Lourdes d'iniquités et de scélératesses;
  Il est las, c'est pourquoi je vous jette au monceau
  D'ordures que des ans emporte le ruisseau!
  Ces jeunes gens penchés sur cette jeune fille,
  J'ai vu cela!  Dieu bon, sont-ils de la famille
  Des vivants, respirant sous ton clair horizon?
  Sont-ce des hommes   Non. Rien qu'à voir la façon
  Dont votre lèvre touche aux vierges endormies,
  Princes, on sent en vous des goules, des lamies,
  D'affreux êtres sortis des cercueils soulevés.
  Je vous rends à la nuit. Tout ce que vous avez
  De la face de l'homme est un mensonge infâme;
  Vous avez quelque bête effroyable au lieu d'âme;
  Sigismond l'assassin, Ladislas le forban,
  Vous êtes des damnés en rupture de ban;
  Donc lâchez les vivants et lâchez les empires!
  Hors du trône, tyrans! à la tombe, vampires!
  Chiens du tombeau, voici le sépulcre. Rentrez.

  Et son doigt est tourné vers le gouffre.

                                         Atterrés,
  Ils s'agenouillent.

                    --Oh! dit Sigismond, fantôme,
  Ne nous emmène pas dans ton morne royaume!
  Nous t'obéirons. Dis, qu'exiges-tu de nous?
  Grâce!

         Et le roi dit: --Vois, nous sommes à genoux,
  Spectre!

            Une vieille femme a la voix moins débile.

  La figure qui tient l'épée est immobile,
  Et se tait, comme si cet être souverain
  Tenait conseil en lui sous son linceul d'airain;
  Tout à coup, élevant sa voix grave et hautaine:

  --Princes, votre façon d'être lâches me gêne.
  je suis homme et non spectre. Allons, debout! mon bras
  Est le bras d'un vivant; il ne me convient pas
  De faire une autre peur que celle où j'ai coutume.
  Je suis Éviradnus.



XVII

LA MASSUE

                        Comme sort de la brume
  Un sévère sapin, vieilli dans l'Appenzell,
  A l'heure où le matin au souffle universel
  Passe, des bois profonds balayant la lisière,
  Le preux ouvre son casque, et hors de la visière
  Sa longue barbe blanche et tranquille apparaît.

  Sigismond s'est dressé comme un dogue en arrêt;
  Ladislas bondit, hurle, ébauche une huée,
  Grince des dents et rit, et, comme la nuée
  Résume en un éclair le gouffre pluvieux,
  Toute sa rage éclate en ce cri:--C'est un vieux!

  Le grand chevalier dit, regardant l'un et l'autre:
  --Rois, un vieux de mon temps vaut deux jeunes du vôtre.
  Je vous défie à mort, laissant à votre choix
  D'attaquer l'un sans l'autre ou tous deux à la fois;
  Prenez au tas quelque arme ici qui vous convienne;
  Vous êtes sans cuirasse et je quitte la mienne;
  Car le châtiment doit lui-même être correct.

  Éviradnus n'a plus que sa veste d'Utrecht.
  Pendant que, grave et froid, il déboucle sa chape,
  Ladislas, furtif, prend un couteau sur la nappe,
  Se déchausse, et, rapide et bras levé, pieds nus,
  Il se glisse en rampant derrière Éviradnus;
  Mais Éviradnus sent qu'on l'attaque en arrière,
  Se tourne, empoigne et tord la lame meurtrière,
  Et sa main colossale étreint comme un étau
  Le cou de Ladislas, qui lâche le couteau;
  Dans l'oeil du nain royal on voit la mort paraître.

  --Je devrais te couper les quatre membres, traître,
  Et te laisser ramper sur tes moignons sanglants.
  Tiens, dit Éviradnus, meurs vite!

                                  Et sur ses flancs
  Le roi s'affaisse, et, blême et l'oeil hors de l'orbite,
  Sans un cri, tant la mort formidable est subite,
  Il expire.

             L'un meurt, mais l'autre s'est dressé.
  Le preux, en délaçant sa cuirasse, a posé
  Sur un banc son épée, et Sigismond l'a prise.
  Le jeune homme effrayant rit de la barbe grise;
  L'épée au poing, joyeux, assassin rayonnant,
  Croisant les bras, il crie: A mon tour maintenant!--
  Et les noirs chevaliers, juges de cette lice,
  Peuvent voir, à deux pas du fatal précipice,
  Près de Mahaud, qui semble un corps inanimé,
  Éviradnus sans arme et Sigismond armé.
  Le gouffre attend. Il faut que l'un des deux y tombe.

  --Voyons un peu sur qui va se fermer la tombe,
  Dit Sigismond. C'est toi le mort, c'est toi le chien!

  Le moment est funèbre; Éviradnus sent bien
  Qu'avant qu'il ait choisi dans quelque armure un glaive
  Il aura dans les reins la pointe qui se lève;
  Que faire?  Tout à coup sur Ladislas gisant
  Son oeil tombe; il sourit, terrible, et, se baissant
  De l'air d'un lion pris qui trouve son issue
  --Hé! dit-il, je n'ai pas besoin d'autre massue!--
  Et, prenant aux talons le cadavre du roi,
  Il marche à l'empereur qui chancelle d'effroi;
  Il brandit le roi mort comme une arme, il en joue,
  Il tient dans ses deux poings les deux pieds, et secoue
  Au-dessus de sa tête, en murmurant: Tout beau!
  Cette espèce de fronde horrible du tombeau,
  Dont le corps est la corde et la tête la pierre.
  Le cadavre éperdu se renverse en arrière,
  Et les bras disloqués font des gestes hideux.

  Lui, crie:--Arrangez-vous, princes, entre vous deux.
  Si l'enfer s'éteignait, dans l'ombre universelle,
  On le rallumerait, certe, avec l'étincelle
  Qu'on peut tirer d'un roi heurtant un empereur.

  Sigismond, sous ce mort qui plane, ivre d'horreur,
  Recule, sans la voir, vers la lugubre trappe;
  Soudain le mort s'abat et le cadavre frappe...
  Éviradnus est seul. Et l'on entend le bruit
  De deux spectres tombant ensemble dans la nuit.
  Le preux se courbe au seuil du puits, son oeil y plonge,
  Et, calme, il dit tout bas, comme parlant en songe:
  --C'est bien! disparaissez, le tigre et le chacal!


XVIII LE JOUR REPARAÎT

  Il reporte Mahaud sur le fauteuil ducal.
  Et, de peur qu'au réveil elle ne s'inquiète,
  Il referme sans bruit l'infernale oubliette,
  Puis remet tout en ordre autour de lui, disant:

  --La chose n'a pas fait une goutte de sang;
  C'est mieux.
  Mais, tout à coup, la cloche au loin éclate;
  Les monts gris sont bordés d'un long fil écarlate;
  Et voici que, partant des branches de genêt,
  Le peuple vient chercher sa dame; l'aube naît.
  Les hameaux sont en branle, on accourt; et, vermeille,
  Mahaud, en même temps que l'aurore, s'éveille;
  Elle pense rêver et croit que le brouillard
  A pris ces jeunes gens pour en faire un vieillard,
  Et les cherche des yeux, les regrettant peut-être;
  Éviradnus salue, et le vieux vaillant maître,
  S'approchant d'elle avec un doux sourire ami:
  --Madame, lui dit-il, avez-vous bien dormi?



SULTAN MOURAD

I

  Mourad, fils du sultan Bajazet, fut un homme
  Glorieux, plus qu'aucun des Tibères de Rome;
  Dans son sérail veillaient les lions accroupis,
  Et Mourad en couvrit de meurtres les tapis;
  On y voyait blanchir des os entre les dalles;
  Un long fleuve de sang de dessous ses sandales
  Sortait, et s'épandait sur la terre, inondant
  L'orient, et fumant dans l'ombre à l'occident;
  Il fit un tel carnage avec son cimeterre
  Que son cheval semblait au monde une panthère;
  Sous lui Smyrne et Tunis, qui regretta ses beys,
  Furent comme des corps qui pendent aux gibets;
  Il fut sublime; il prit, mêlant la force aux ruses,
  Le Caucase aux Kirghis et le Liban aux Druses;
  Il fit, après l'assaut, pendre les magistrats
  D'Éphèse, et rouer vifs les prêtres de Patras;
  Grâce à Mourad, suivi des victoires rampantes,
  Le vautour essuyait son bec fauve aux charpentes
  Du temple de Thésée encor pleines de clous;
  Grâce à lui, l'on voyait dans Athènes des loups,
  Et la ronce couvrait de sa verte tunique
  Tous ces vieux pans de murs écroulés, Salonique,
  Corinthe, Argos, Varna, Tyr, Didymothicos,
  Où l'on n'entendait plus parler que les échos;
  Mourad fut saint; il fit étrangler ses huit frères;
  Comme les deux derniers, petits, cherchaient leurs mères
  Et s'enfuyaient, avant de les faire mourir
  Tout autour de la chambre il les laissa courir;
  Mourad, parmi la foule invitée à ses fêtes,
  Passait, le cangiar à la main, et les têtes
  S'envolaient de son sabre ainsi que des oiseaux;
  Mourad, qui ruina Delphe, Ancyre et Naxos,
  Comme on cueille un fruit mûr tuait une province;
  Il anéantissait le peuple avec le prince,
  Les temples et les dieux, les rois et les donjons;
  L'eau n'a pas plus d'essaims d'insectes dans ses joncs
  Qu'il n'avait de rois et de spectres épiques
  Volant autour de lui dans les forêts de piques;
  Mourad, fils étoilé de sultans triomphants,
  Ouvrit, l'un après l'autre et vivants, douze enfants
  Pour trouver dans leur ventre une pomme volée;
  Mourad fut magnanime; il détruisit Élée,
  Mégare et Famagouste avec l'aide d'Allah;
  Il effaça de terre Agrigente; il brûla
  Fiume et Rhode, voulant avoir des femmes blanches;
  Il fit scier son oncle Achmet entre deux planches
  De cèdre, afin de faire honneur à ce vieillard;
  Mourad fut sage et fort; son père mourut tard,
  Mourad l'aida; ce père avait laissé vingt femmes,
  Filles d'Europe ayant dans leurs regards des âmes,
  Ou filles de Tiflis au sein blanc, au teint clair;
  Sultan Mourad jeta ces femmes à la mer
  Dans des sacs convulsifs que la houle profonde
  Emporta, se tordant confusément dans l'onde;
  Mourad les fit noyer toutes; ce fut sa loi.

         *       *       *       *       *

  D'Aden et d'Erzeroum il fit de larges fosses,
  Un charnier de Modon vaincue, et trois amas
  De cadavres d'Alep, de Brousse et de Damas;
  Un jour, tirant de l'arc, il prit son fils pour cible,
  Et le tua; Mourad sultan fut invincible;
  Vlad, boyard de Tarvis, appelé Belzébuth,
  Refuse de payer au sultan son tribut,
  Prend l'ambassade turque et la fait périr toute
  Sur trente pals, plantés aux deux bords d'une route;
  Mourad accourt, brûlant moissons, granges, greniers,
  Bat le boyard, lui fait vingt mille prisonniers,
  Puis, autour de l'immense et noir champ de bataille,
  Bâtit un large mur tout en pierre de taille,
  Et fait dans les créneaux, pleins d'affreux cris plaintifs,
  Maçonner et murer les vingt mille captifs,
  Laissant des trous par où l'on voit leurs yeux dans l'ombre,
  Et part, après avoir écrit sur leur mur sombre:
  'Mourad, tailleur de pierre, à Vlad, planteur de pieux.'
  Mourad était croyant, Mourad était pieux;
  Il brûla cent couvents de chrétiens en Eubée,
  Où par hasard sa foudre était un jour tombée;
  Mourad fut quarante ans l'éclatant meurtrier
  Sabrant le monde, ayant Dieu sous son étrier;
  Il eut le Rhamséion et le Généralife;
  Il fut le padischah, l'empereur, le calife,
  Et les prêtres disaient; 'Allah! Mourad est grand.'


II

  Législateur horrible et pire conquérant,
  N'ayant autour de lui que des troupeaux infâmes,
  De la foule, de l'homme en poussière, des âmes
  D'où des langues sortaient pour lui lécher les pieds,
  Loué pour ses forfaits toujours inexpiés,
  Flatté par ses vaincus et baisé par ses proies,
  Il vivait dans l'encens, dans l'orgueil, dans les joies
  Avec l'immense ennui du méchant adoré.

  Il était le faucheur, la terre était le pré.


III

  Un jour, comme il passait à pied dans une rue
  A Bagdad, tête auguste au vil peuple apparue,
  A l'heure où les maisons, les arbres et les blés
  Jettent sur les chemins de soleil accablés
  Leur frange d'ombre au bord d'un tapis de lumière,
  Il vit, à quelques pas du seuil d'une chaumière,
  Gisant à terre, un porc fétide qu'un boucher
  Venait de saigner vif avant de l'écorcher;
  Cette bête râlait devant cette masure;
  Son cou s'ouvrait, béant d'une affreuse blessure;
  Le soleil de midi brûlait l'agonisant;
  Dans la plaie implacable et sombre, dont le sang
  Faisait un lac fumant à la porte du bouge,
  Chacun de ses rayons entrait comme un fer rouge;
  Comme s'ils accouraient à l'appel du soleil,
  Cent moustiques suçaient la plaie au bord vermeil;
  Comme autour de leur lit voltigent les colombes,
  Ils allaient et venaient, parasites des tombes,
  Les pattes dans le sang, l'aile dans le rayon;
  Car la mort, l'agonie et la corruption
  Sont ici-bas le seul mystérieux désastre
  Où la mouche travaille en même temps que l'astre;
  Le porc ne pouvait faire un mouvement, livré
  Au féroce soleil, des mouches dévoré;
  On voyait tressaillir l'effroyable coupure;
  Tous les passants fuyaient loin de la bête impure;
  Qui donc eût eu pitié de ce malheur hideux?
  Le porc et le sultan étaient seuls tous les deux;
  L'un torturé, mourant, maudit, infect, immonde;
  L'autre, empereur, puissant, vainqueur; maître du monde,
  Triomphant aussi haut que l'homme peut monter,
  Comme si le destin eût voulu confronter
  Les deux extrémités sinistres des ténèbres.
  Le porc, dont un frisson agitait les vertèbres,
  Râlait, triste, épuisé, morne; et le padischah
  De cet être difforme et sanglant s'approcha,
  Comme on s'arrête au bord d'un gouffre qui se creuse;
  Mourad pencha son front sur la bête lépreuse,
  Puis la poussa du pied dans l'ombre du chemin,
  Et, de ce même geste énorme et surhumain
  Dont il chassait les rois, Mourad chassa les mouches.
  Le porc mourant rouvrit ses paupières farouches,
  Regarda d'un regard ineffable, un moment,
  L'homme qui l'assistait dans son accablement;
  Puis son oeil se perdit dans l'immense mystère;
  Il expira.


IV

           Le jour où ceci sur la terre
  S'accomplissait, voici ce que voyait le ciel:

  C'était dans l'endroit calme, apaisé, solennel,
  Où luit l'astre idéal sous l'idéal nuage,
  Au delà de la vie, et de l'heure, et de l'âge,
  Hors de ce qu'on appelle espace, et des contours
  Des songes qu'ici-bas nous nommons nuits et jours;
  Lieu d'évidence où l'âme enfin peut voir les causes,
  Où, voyant le revers inattendu des choses,
  On comprend, et l'on dit: C'est bien!--l'autre côté
  De la chimère sombre étant la vérité;
  Lieu blanc, chaste, où le mal s'évanouit et sombre.
  L'étoile en cet azur semble une goutte d'ombre.

  Ce qui rayonne là, ce n'est pas un vain jour
  Qui naît et meurt, riant et pleurant tour à tour,
  Jaillissant, puis rentrant dans la noirceur première,
  Et, comme notre aurore, un sanglot de lumière;
  C'est un grand jour divin, regardé dans les cieux
  Par les soleils, comme est le nôtre par les yeux;
  Jour pur, expliquant tout, quoiqu'il soit le problème;
  Jour qui terrifierait s'il n'était l'espoir même;
  De toute l'étendue éclairant l'épaisseur,
  Foudre par l'épouvante, aube par la douceur.
  Là, toutes les beautés tonnent épanouies;
  Là, frissonnent en paix les lueurs inouïes;
  Là, les ressuscités ouvrent leur oeil béni
  Au resplendissement de l'éclair infini;
  Là, les vastes rayons passent comme des ondes.

  C'était sur le sommet du Sinaï des mondes;
  C'était là.

             Le nuage auguste, par moments,
  Se fendait, et jetait des éblouissements.
  Toute la profondeur entourait cette cime.

  On distinguait, avec un tremblement sublime,
  Quelqu'un d'inexprimable au fond de la clarté.

  Et tout frémissait, tout, l'aube et l'obscurité,
  Les anges, les soleils, et les êtres suprêmes,
  Devant un vague front couvert de diadèmes.
  Dieu méditait.

               Celui qui crée et qui sourit,
  Celui qu'en bégayant nous appelons Esprit,
  Bonté, Force, Équité, Perfection, Sagesse,
  Regarde devant lui, toujours, sans fin, sans cesse,
  Fuir les siècles ainsi que des mouches d'été.
  Car il est éternel avec tranquillité.

  Et dans l'ombre hurlait tout un gouffre, la terre.

  En bas, sous une brume épaisse, cette sphère
  Rampait, monde lugubre où les pâles humains
  Passaient et s'écroulaient et se tordaient les mains.
  On apercevait l'Inde et le Nil, des mêlées
  D'exterminations et de villes brûlées,
  Et des champs ravagés et des clairons soufflant,
  Et l'Europe livide ayant un glaive au flanc;
  Des vapeurs de tombeau, des lueurs de repaire;
  Cinq frères tout sanglants; l'oncle, le fils, le père;
  Des hommes dans des murs, vivants, quoique pourris;
  Des têtes voletant, mornes chauves-souris,
  Autour d'un sabre nu, fécond en funérailles;
  Des enfants éventrés soutenant leurs entrailles;
  Et de larges bûchers fumaient, et des tronçons
  D'êtres sciés en deux rampaient dans les tisons;
  Et le vaste étouffeur des plaintes et des râles,
  L'Océan, échouait dans les nuages pâles
  D'affreux sacs noirs faisant des gestes effrayants;
  Et ce chaos de fronts hagards, de pas fuyants,
  D'yeux en pleurs, d'ossements, de larves, de décombres,
  Ce brumeux tourbillon de spectres, et ces ombres
  Secouant des linceuls, et tous ces morts, saignant
  Au loin, d'un continent à l'autre continent,
  Pendant aux pals, cloués aux croix, nus sur les claies,
  Criaient, montrant leurs fers, leur sang, leurs maux, leurs plaies:

  --C'est Mourad! c'est Mourad! justice, ô Dieu vivant!

  A ce cri, qu'apportait de toutes parts le vent,
  Les tonnerres jetaient des grondements étranges,
  Des flamboiements passaient sur les faces des anges,
  Les grilles de l'enfer s'empourpraient, le courroux
  En faisait remuer d'eux-mêmes les verrous,
  Et l'on voyait sortir de l'abîme insondable
  Une sinistre main qui s'ouvrait formidable;
  'Justice!' répétait l'ombre, et le châtiment
  Au fond de l'infini se dressait lentement.

  Soudain du plus profond des nuits, sur la nuée,
  Une bête difforme, affreuse, exténuée,
  Un être abject et sombre, un pourceau, s'éleva;
  Ouvrant un oeil sanglant qui cherchait Jéhovah;
  La nuée apporta le porc dans la lumière,
  A l'endroit même où luit l'unique sanctuaire,
  Le saint des saints, jamais décru, jamais accru;
  Et le porc murmura:--Grâce! il m'a secouru.
  Le pourceau misérable et Dieu se regardèrent.

  Alors, selon des lois que hâtent ou modèrent
  Les volontés de l'Être effrayant qui construit
  Dans les ténèbres l'aube et dans le jour nuit,
  On vit, dans le brouillard où rien n'a plus de forme,
  Vaguement apparaître une balance énorme;
  Cette balance vint d'elle-même, à travers
  Tous les enfers béants, tous les cieux entr'ouverts,
  Se placer sous la foule immense des victimes;
  Au-dessus du silence horrible des abîmes,
  Sous l'oeil du seul vivant, du seul vrai, du seul grand,
  Terrible, elle oscillait, et portait, s'éclairant
  D'un jour mystérieux plus profond que le nôtre,
  Dans un plateau le monde et le pourceau dans l'autre.

  Du côté du pourceau la balance pencha.


V

  Mourad, le haut calife et l'altier padischah,
  En sortant de la rue où les gens de la ville
  L'avaient pu voir toucher à cette bête vile,
  Fut le soir même pris d'une fièvre, et mourut.

  Le tombeau des soudans, bâti de jaspe brut,
  Couvert d'orfèvrerie, auguste, et dont l'entrée
  Semble l'intérieur d'une bête éventrée
  Qui serait tout en or et tout en diamants,
  Ce monument, superbe entre les monuments,
  Qui hérisse, au-dessus d'un mur de briques sèches,
  Son faîte plein de tours comme un carquois de flèches,
  Ce turbé que Bagdad montre encore aujourd'hui,
  Reçut le sultan mort et se ferma sur lui.

  Quand il fut là, gisant et couché sous la pierre,
  Mourad ouvrit les yeux et vit une lumière;
  Sans qu'on pût distinguer l'astre ni le flambeau,
  Un éblouissement remplissait son tombeau;
  Une aube s'y levait, prodigieuse et douce;
  Et sa prunelle éteinte eut l'étrange secousse
  D'une porte de jour qui s'ouvre dans la nuit.
  Il aperçut l'échelle immense qui conduit
  Les actions de l'homme à l'oeil qui voit les âmes;
  Et les clartés étaient des roses et des flammes;
  Et Mourad entendit une voix qui disait:

  --Mourad, neveu d'Achmet et fils de Bajazet,
  Tu semblais à jamais perdu; ton âme infime
  N'était plus qu'un ulcère et ton destin un crime;
  Tu sombrais parmi ceux que le mal submergea;
  Déjà Satan était visible en toi; déjà
  Sans t'en douter, promis aux tourbillons funèbres
  Des spectres sous la voûte infâme des ténèbres,
  Tu portais sur ton dos les ailes de la nuit;
  De ton pas sépulcral l'enfer guettait le bruit;
  Autour de toi montait, par ton crime attirée,
  L'obscurité du gouffre ainsi qu'une marée;
  Tu penchais sur l'abîme où l'homme est châtié;
  Mais tu viens d'avoir, monstre, un éclair de pitié;
  Une lueur suprême et désintéressée
  A, comme à ton insu, traversé ta pensée,
  Et je t'ai fait mourir dans ton bon mouvement;
  Il suffit, pour sauver même l'homme inclément,
  Même le plus sanglant des bourreaux et des maîtres,
  Du moindre des bienfaits sur le dernier des êtres;
  Un seul instant d'amour rouvre l'éden fermé;
  Un pourceau secouru pèse un monde opprimé;
  Viens! le ciel s'offre, avec ses étoiles sans nombre,
  En frémissant de joie, à l'évadé de l'ombre!
  Viens! tu fus bon un jour, sois à jamais heureux.
  Entre, transfiguré; tes crimes ténébreux,
  O roi, derrière toi s'effacent dans les gloires;
  Tourne la tête, et vois blanchir tes ailes noires.



LA CONFIANCE DU MARQUIS FABRICE

I

ISORA DE FINAL.--FABRICE D'ALBENGA

  Tout au bord de la mer de Gênes, sur un mont
  Qui jadis vit passer les Francs de Pharamond,
  Un enfant, un aïeul, seuls dans la citadelle
  De Final sur qui veille une garde fidèle,
  Vivent bien entourés de murs et de ravins;
  Et l'enfant a cinq ans et l'aïeul quatre-vingts.

  L'enfant est Isora de Final, héritière
  Du fief dont Witikind a tracé la frontière;
  L'orpheline n'a plus près d'elle que l'aïeul.
  L'abandon sur Final a jeté son linceul;
  L'herbe, dont par endroits les dalles sont couvertes,
  Aux fentes des pavés fait des fenêtres vertes;
  Sur la route oubliée on n'entend plus un pas;
  Car le père et la mère, hélas! ne s'en vont pas
  Sans que la vie autour des enfants s'assombrisse.

  L'aïeul est le marquis d'Albenga, ce Fabrice
  Qui fut bon; cher au pâtre, aimé du laboureur;
  Il fut, pour guerroyer le pape ou l'empereur,
  Commandeur de la mer et général des villes;
  Gênes le fit abbé du peuple, et, des mains viles
  Ayant livré l'état aux rois, il combattit.
  Tout homme auprès de lui jadis semblait petit;
  L'antique Sparte était sur son visage empreinte;
  La loyauté mettait sa cordiale étreinte
  Dans la main de cet homme à bien faire obstiné.
  Comme il était bâtard d'Othon, dit le Non-Né,

         *       *       *       *       *
         *       *       *       *       *

  Les rois faisaient dédain de ce fils belliqueux;
  Fabrice s'en vengeait en étant plus grand qu'eux.
  A vingt ans, il était blond et beau; ce jeune homme
  Avait l'air d'un tribun militaire de Rome;
  Comme pour exprimer les détours du destin
  Dont le héros triomphe, un graveur florentin
  Avait sur son écu sculpté le labyrinthe;
  Les femmes l'admiraient, se montrant avec crainte
  La tête de lion qu'il avait dans le dos.
  Il a vu les plus fiers, Requesens et Chandos,
  Et Robert, avoué d'Arras, sieur de Béthune,
  Fuir devant son épée et devant sa fortune;
  Les princes pâlissaient de l'entendre gronder;
  Un jour, il a forcé le pape à demander
  Une fuite rapide aux galères de Gênes;
  C'était un grand briseur de lances et de chaînes,
  Guerroyant volontiers, mais surtout délivrant;
  Il a par tous été proclamé le plus grand
  D'un siècle fort auquel succède un siècle traître;
  Il a toujours frémi quand des bouches de prêtre
  Dans les sombres clairons de la guerre ont soufflé;
  Et souvent de saint Pierre il a tordu la clé
  Dans la vieille serrure horrible de l'Église.
  Sa bannière cherchait la bourrasque et la bise;
  Plus d'un monstre a grincé des dents sous son talon,
  Son bras se roidissait chaque fois qu'un félon
  Déformait quelque état populaire en royaume.
  Allant, venant dans l'ombre ainsi qu'un grand fantôme,
  Fier, levant dans la nuit son cimier flamboyant,
  Homme auguste au dedans, ferme au dehors, ayant
  En lui toute la gloire et toute la patrie,
  Belle âme invulnérable et cependant meurtrie,
  Sauvant les lois, gardant les murs, vengeant les droits,
  Et sonnant dans la nuit sous tous les coups des rois,
  Cinquante ans, ce soldat, dont la tête enfin plie,
  Fut l'armure de fer de la vieille Italie,
  Et ce noir siècle, à qui tout rayon semble ôté,
  Garde quelque lueur encor de son côté.


II

LE DÉFAUT DE LA CUIRASSE

  Maintenant il est vieux; son donjon, c'est son cloître;
  Il tombe, et, déclinant, sent dans son âme croître
  La confiance honnête et calme des grands coeurs;
  Le brave ne croit pas au lâche, les vainqueurs
  Sont forts, et le héros est ignorant du fourbe.
  Ce qu'osent les tyrans, ce qu'accepte la tourbe,
  Il ne le sait; il est hors de ce siècle vil;
  N'en étant vu qu'à peine, à peine le voit-il;
  N'ayant jamais de ruse, il n'eut jamais de crainte;
  Son défaut fut toujours la crédulité sainte,
  Et quand il fut vaincu, ce fut par loyauté;
  Plus de péril lui fait plus de sécurité.
  Comme dans un exil il vit seul dans sa gloire,
  Oublié; l'ancien peuple a gardé sa mémoire,
  Mais le nouveau le perd dans l'ombre, et ce vieillard,
  Qui fut astre, s'éteint dans un morne brouillard.

  Dans sa brume, où les feux du couchant se dispersent,
  Il a cette mer vaste et ce grand ciel qui versent
  Sur le bonheur la joie et sur le deuil l'ennui.

  Tout est derrière lui maintenant; tout a fui;
  L'ombre d'un siècle entier devant ses pas s'allonge;
  Il semble des yeux suivre on ne sait quel grand songe;
  Parfois, il marche et va sans entendre et sans voir.
  Vieillir, sombre déclin! l'homme est triste le soir;
  Il sent l'accablement de l'oeuvre finissante.
  On dirait par instants que son âme s'absente,
  Et va savoir là-haut s'il est temps de partir.

  Il n'a pas un remords et pas un repentir;
  Après quatre vingts ans son âme est toute blanche;
  Parfois, à ce soldat qui s'accoude et se penche,
  Quelque vieux mur, croulant lui-même, offre un appui;
  Grave, il pense, et tous ceux qui sont auprès de lui
  L'aiment; il faut aimer pour jeter sa racine
  Dans un isolement et dans une ruine;
  Et la feuille de lierre a la forme d'un coeur.


III

AÏEUL MATERNEL

  Ce vieillard, c'est un chêne adorant une fleur;
  A présent un enfant est toute sa famille.
  Il la regarde, il rêve; il dit:  'C'est une fille,
  Tant mieux!' Étant aïeul du côté maternel.

  La vie en ce donjon a le pas solennel;
  L'heure passe et revient ramenant l'habitude.

  Ignorant le soupçon, la peur, l'inquiétude,
  Tous les matins, il boucle à ses flancs refroidis
  Son épée, aujourd'hui rouillée, et qui jadis
  Avait la pesanteur de la chose publique;
  Quand parfois du fourreau, vénérable relique,
  Il arrache la lame illustre avec effort,
  Calme, il y croit toujours sentir peser le sort.
  Tout homme ici-bas porte en sa main une chose,
  Où, du bien et du mal, de l'effet, de la cause,
  Du genre humain, de Dieu, du gouffre, il sent le poids;
  Le juge au front morose a son livre des lois,
  Le roi son sceptre d'or, le fossoyeur sa pelle.

  Tous les soirs il conduit l'enfant à la chapelle;
  L'enfant prie, et regarde avec ses yeux si bèaux,
  Gaie, et questionnant l'aïeul sur les tombeaux;
  Et Fabrice a dans l'oeil une humide étincelle.
  La main qui tremble aidant la marche qui chancelle,
  Ils vont sous les portails et le long des piliers
  Peuplés de séraphins mêlés aux chevaliers;
  Chaque statue, émue à leur pas doux et sombre,
  Vibre, et toutes ont l'air de saluer dans l'ombre,
  Les héros le vieillard, et les anges l'enfant.

  Parfois Isoretta, que sa grâce défend,
  S'échappe dès l'aurore et s'en va jouer seule
  Dans quelque grande tour qui lui semble une aïeule
  Et qui mêle, croulante au milieu des buissons,
  La légende romane aux souvenirs saxons.
  Pauvre être qui contient toute une fière race,
  Elle trouble, en passant, le bouc, vieillard vorace,
  Dans les fentes des murs broutant le câprier;
  Pendant que derrière elle on voit l'aïeul prier,
  --Car il ne tarde pas à venir la rejoindre,
  Et cherche son enfant dès qu'il voit l'aube poindre,--
  Elle court, va, revient, met sa robe en haillons,
  Erre de tombe en tombe et suit des papillons,
  Ou s'assied, l'air pensif, sur quelque âpre architrave;
  Et la tour semble heureuse et l'enfant paraît grave;
  La ruine et l'enfance ont de secrets accords,
  Car le temps sombre y met ce qui reste des morts.


IV UN SEUL HOMME SAIT OÙ EST CACHÉ LE TRÉSOR

  Dans ce siècle où tout peuple a son chef qui le broie,
  Parmi les rois vautours et les princes de proie,
  Certe, on n'en trouverait pas un qui méprisât
  Final, donjon splendide et riche marquisat;
  Tous les ans, les alleux, les rentes, les censives,
  Surchargent vingt mulets de sacoches massives;
  La grande tour surveille, au milieu du ciel bleu,
  Le sud, le nord, l'ouest et l'est, et saint Mathieu,
  Saint Marc, saint Luc, saint Jean, les quatre évangélistes,
  Sont sculptés et dorés sur les quatre balistes;
  La montagne a pour garde, en outre, deux châteaux,
  Soldats de pierre ayant du fer sous leurs manteaux.
  Le trésor, quand du coffre on détache les boucles,
  Semble à qui l'entrevoit un rêve d'escarboucles;
  Ce trésor est muré dans un caveau discret
  Dont le marquis régnant garde seul le secret,
  Et qui fut autrefois le puits d'une sachette;
  Fabrice maintenant connaît seul la cachette;
  Le fils de Witikind vieilli dans les combats,
  Othon, scella jadis dans les chambres d'en bas
  Vingt caissons dont le fer verrouille les façades,
  Et qu'Anselme plus tard fit remplir de cruzades,
  Pour que dans l'avenir jamais on n'en manquât;
  Le casque du marquis est en or de ducat;
  On a sculpté deux rois persans, Narse et Tigrane,
  Dans la visière aux trous grillés de filigrane,
  Et sur le haut cimier, taillé d'un seul onyx,
  Un brasier de rubis brûle l'oiseau Phénix;
  Et le seul diamant du sceptre pèse une once.


V

LE CORBEAU

  Un matin, les portiers sonnent du cor. Un nonce
  Se présente; il apporte, assisté d'un coureur,
  Une lettre du roi qu'on nomme l'empereur;
  Ratbert écrit qu'avant de partir pour Tarente
  Il viendra visiter Isora, sa parente,
  Pour lui baiser le front et pour lui faire honneur.

  Le nonce, s'inclinant, dit au marquis:--Seigneur,
  Sa majesté ne fait de visites qu'aux reines.

  Au message émané de ses mains très sereines
  L'empereur joint un don splendide et triomphant;
  C'est un grand chariot plein de jouets d'enfant;
  Isora bat des mains avec des cris de joie.

  Le nonce, retournant vers celui qui l'envoie,
  Prend congé de l'enfant, et, comme procureur
  Du très victorieux et très noble empereur,
  Fait le salut qu'on fait aux têtes souveraines.

  --Qu'il soit le bienvenu!  Bas le pont!  bas les chaînes!
  Dit le marquis; sonnez la trompe et l'olifant!--
  Et, fier de voir qu'on traite en reine son enfant,
  La joie a rayonné sur sa face loyale.

  Or, comme il relisait la lettre impériale,
  Un corbeau qui passait fit de l'ombre dessus.
  --Les oiseaux noirs guidaient Judas cherchant Jésus;
  Sire, vois ce corbeau, dit une sentinelle.
  Et, regardant l'oiseau planer sur la tournelle:
  --Bah! dit l'aïeul, j'étais pas plus haut que cela,
  Compagnon, déjà ce corbeau que voilà,
  Dans la plus fière tour de toute la contrée
  Avait bâti son nid, dont on voyait l'entrée;
  Je le connais; le soir, volant dans la vapeur,
  Il criait; tous tremblaient; mais, loin d'en avoir peur,
  Moi petit, je l'aimais; ce corbeau centenaire
  Étant un vieux voisin de l'astre et du tonnerre.


VI

LE PÉRE ET LA MÈRE

  Les marquis de Final ont leur royal tombeau
  Dans une cave où luit, jour et nuit, un flambeau;
  Le soir, l'homme qui met de l'huile dans les lampes
  A son heure ordinaire en descendit les rampes;
  Là, mangé par les vers dans l'ombre de la mort,
  Chaque marquis auprès de sa marquise dort,
  Sans voir cette clarté qu'un vieil esclave apporte.
  A l'endroit même où pend la lampe, sous la porte,
  Était le monument des deux derniers défunts;
  Pour raviver la flamme et brûler des parfums,
  Le serf s'en approcha; sur la funèbre table,
  Sculpté très ressemblant, le couple lamentable
  Dont Isora, sa dame, était l'unique enfant,
  Apparaissait; tous deux, dans cet air étouffant,
  Silencieux, couchés côte à côte, statues
  Aux mains jointes, d'habits seigneuriaux vêtues,
  L'homme avec son lion, la femme avec son chien.
  Il vit que le flambeau nocturne brûlait bien;
  Puis, courbé, regarda, des pleurs dans la paupière,
  Ce père de granit, cette mère de pierre;
  Alors il recula, pâle; car il crut voir
  Que ces deux fronts, tournés vers la voûte au fond noir,
  S'étaient subitement assombris sur leur couche,
  Elle ayant l'air plus triste et lui l'air plus farouche.


VII

JOIE AU CHÂTEAU

  Une file de longs et pesants chariots
  Qui précède ou qui suit les camps impériaux
  Marche là-bas avec des éclats de trompette
  Et des cris que l'écho des montagnes répète.
  Un gros de lances brille à l'horizon lointain.

  La cloche de Final tinte, et c'est ce matin
  Que du noble empereur on attend la visite.

  On arrache des tours la ronce parasite;
  On blanchit à la chaux en hâte les grands murs;
  On range dans la cour des plateaux de fruits mûrs;
  Des grenades venant des vieux monts Alpujarres,
  Le vin dans les barils et l'huile dans les jarres;
  L'herbe et la sauge en fleur jonchent tout l'escalier;
  Dans la cuisine un feu rôtit un sanglier;
  On voit fumer les peaux des bêtes qu'on écorche;
  Et tout rit; et l'on a tendu sous le grand porche
  Une tapisserie où Blanche d'Est jadis
  A brodé trois héros, Macchabée, Amadis,
  Achille, et le fanal de Rhode, et le quadrige
  D'Aétius, vainqueur du peuple latobrige,
  Et, dans trois médaillons marqués d'un chiffre en or,
  Trois poëtes, Platon, Plaute et Scaeva Memor.
  Ce tapis autrefois ornait la grande chambre;
  Au dire des vieillards, l'effrayant roi sicambre,
  Witikind, l'avait fait clouer en cet endroit,
  De peur que dans leur lit ses enfants n'eussent froid.


VIII

LA TOILETTE D'ISORA

  Cris, chansons; et voilà ces vieilles tours vivantes.
  La chambre d'Isora se remplit de servantes;
  Pour faire un digne accueil au roi d'Arle, on revêt
  L'enfant de ses habits de fête; à son chevet,
  L'aïeul, dans un fauteuil d'orme incrusté d'érable,
  S'assied, songeant aux jours passés, et, vénérable,
  Il contemple Isora, front joyeux, cheveux d'or,
  Comme les chérubins peints dans le corridor,
  Regard d'enfant Jésus que porte la madone,
  Joue ignorante où dort le seul baiser qui donne
  Aux lèvres la fraîcheur, tous les autres étant
  Des flammes, même, hélas! quand le coeur est content.
  Isora est sur le lit assise, jambes nues;
  Son oeil bleu rêve avec des lueurs ingénues;
  L'aïeul rit, doux reflet de l'aube sur le soir!
  Et le sein de l'enfant, demi-nu, laisse voir
  Ce bouton rose, germe auguste des mamelles;
  Et ses beaux petits bras ont des mouvements d'ailes.
  Le vétéran lui prend les mains, les réchauffant;
  Et, dans tout ce qu'il dit aux femmes, à l'enfant,
  Sans ordre, en en laissant deviner davantage,
  Espèce de murmure enfantin du grand âge,
  Il semble qu'on entend parler toutes les voix
  De la vie, heur, malheur, à présent, autrefois,
  Deuil, espoir, souvenir, rire et pleurs, joie et peine;
  Ainsi, tous les oiseaux chantent dans le grand chêne.

  --Fais-toi belle; un seigneur va venir; il est bon;
  C'est l'empereur; un roi, ce n'est pas un barbon
  Comme nous; il est jeune; il est roi d'Arle, en France;
  Vois-tu, tu lui feras ta belle révérence,
  Et tu n'oublieras pas de dire: monseigneur.
  Vois tous les beaux cadeaux qu'il nous fait! Quel bonheur!
  Tous nos bons paysans viendront, parce qu'on t'aime
  Et tu leur jetteras des sequins d'or, toi-même,
  De façon que cela tombe dans leur bonnet.

  Et le marquis, parlant aux femmes, leur prenait
  Les vêtements des mains.

                         --Laissez, que je l'habille!
  Oh! quand sa mère était toute petite fille,
  Et que j'étais déjà barbe grise, elle avait
  Coutume de venir dès l'aube à mon chevet;
  Parfois, elle voulait m'attacher mon épée,
  Et, de la dureté d'une boucle occupée,
  Ou se piquant les doigts aux clous du ceinturon,
  Elle riait. C'était le temps où mon clairon
  Sonnait superbement à travers l'Italie.
  Ma fille est maintenant sous terre, et nous oublie.
  D'où vient qu'elle a quitté sa tâche, ô dure loi!
  Et qu'elle dort déjà quand je veille encor, moi?
  La fille qui grandit sans la mère, chancelle.
  Oh! c'est triste, et je hais la mort. Pourquoi prend-elle
  Cette jeune épousée et non mes pas tremblants?
  Pourquoi ces cheveux noirs et non mes cheveux blancs?

  Et, pleurant, il offrait à l'enfant des dragées.

  --Les choses ne sont pas ainsi bien arrangées;
  Celui qui fait le choix se trompe; il serait mieux
  Que l'enfant eût la mère et la tombe le vieux.
  Mais de la mère au moins il sied qu'on se souvienne;
  Et, puisqu'elle a ma place, hélas! je prends la sienne.

  --Vois donc le beau soleil et les fleurs dans les prés!
  C'est par un jour pareil, les Grecs étant rentrés
  Dans Smyrne, le plus grand de leurs ports maritimes,
  Que, le bailli de Rhode et moi, nous les battîmes.
  Mais regarde-moi donc tous ces beaux jouets-là!
  Vois ce reître, on dirait un archer d'Attila.
  Mais c'est qu'il est vêtu de soie et non de serge!
  Et le chapeau d'argent de cette sainte Vierge!
  Et ce bonhomme en or! Ce n'est pas très hideux.
  Mais comme nous allons jouer demain tous deux!
  Si ta mère était là, qu'elle serait contente!
  Ah! quand on est enfant, ce qui plaît, ce qui tente,
  C'est un hochet qui sonne un moment dans la main,
  Peu de chose le soir et rien le lendemain;
  Plus tard, on a le goût des soldats véritables,
  Des palefrois battant du pied dans les étables,
  Des drapeaux, des buccins jetant de longs éclats,
  Des camps, et c'est toujours la même chose, hélas!
  Sinon qu'alors on a du sang à ses chimères.
  Tout est vain. C'est égal, je plains les pauvres mères
  Qui laissent leurs enfants derrière elles ainsi--
  Ainsi parlait l'aïeul, l'oeil de pleurs obscurci,
  Souriant cependant, car telle est l'ombre humaine.
  Tout à l'ajustement de son ange de reine,
  Il habillait l'enfant, et, tandis qu'à genoux
  Les servantes chaussaient ces pieds charmants et doux
  Et, les parfumant d'ambre, en lavaient la poussière,
  Il nouait gauchement la petite brassière,
  Ayant plus d'habitude aux chemises d'acier.


IX

JOIE HORS DU CHÂTEAU

  Le soir vient, le soleil descend dans son brasier;
  Et voilà qu'au penchant des mers, sur les collines,
  Partout, les milans roux, les chouettes félines,
  L'autour glouton, l'orfraie horrible dont l'oeil luit
  Avec du sang le jour, qui devient feu la nuit,
  Tous les tristes oiseaux mangeurs de chair humaine,
  Fils de ces vieux vautours nés de l'aigle romaine
  Que la louve d'airain aux cirques appela,
  Qui suivaient Marius et connaissaient Sylla,
  S'assemblent; et les uns, laissant un crâne chauve,
  Les autres, aux gibets essuyant leur bec fauve,
  D'autres, d'un mât rompu quittant les noirs agrès,
  D'autres, prenant leur vol du mur des lazarets,
  Tous, joyeux et criant, en tumulte et sans nombre,
  Ils se montrent Final, la grande cime sombre
  Qu'Othon, fils d'Aleram le Saxon, crénela,
  Et se disent entre eux: Un empereur est là!

SUITE DE LA JOIE

  Cloche; acclamations; gémissements; fanfares;
  Feux de joie; et les tours semblent toutes des phares,
  Tant on a, pour fêter ce jour grand à jamais,
  De brasiers frissonnants encombré leurs sommets.
  La table colossale en plein air est dressée.
  Ce qu'on a sous les yeux répugne à la pensée
  Et fait peur; c'est la joie effrayante du mal;
  C'est plus que le démon, c'est moins que l'animal;
  C'est la cour du donjon tout entière rougie
  D'une prodigieuse et ténébreuse orgie;
  C'est Final, mais Final vaincu, tombé, flétri;
  C'est un chant dans lequel semble se tordre un cri;
  Un gouffre où les lueurs de l'enfer sont voisines
  Du rayonnement calme et joyeux des cuisines;
  Le triomphe de l'ombre, obscène, effronté, cru;
  Le souper de Satan dans un rêve apparu.

  A l'angle de la cour, ainsi qu'un témoin sombre,
  Un squelette de tour, formidable décombre,
  Sur son faîte vermeil d'où s'enfuit le corbeau,
  Dresse et secoue aux vents, brûlant comme un flambeau,
  Tout le branchage et tout le feuillage d'un orme;
  Valet géant portant un chandelier énorme.

  Le drapeau de l'empire, arboré sur ce bruit,
  Gonfle son aigle immense au souffle de la nuit.

  Tout un cortège étrange est là; femmes et prêtres;
  Prélats parmi les ducs, moines parmi les reîtres;
  Les crosses et les croix d'évêques, au milieu
  Des piques et des dards, mêlent aux meurtres Dieu,
  Les mitres figurant de plus gros fers de lance.
  Un tourbillon d'horreur, de nuit, de violence,
  Semble emplir tous ces coeurs; que disent-ils entre eux,
  Ces hommes? En voyant ces convives affreux,
  On doute si l'aspect humain est véritable;
  Un sein charmant se dresse au-dessus de la table,
  On redoute au-dessous quelque corps tortueux;
  C'est un de ces banquets du monde monstrueux
  Qui règne et vit depuis les Héliogabales;
  Le luth lascif s'accouple aux féroces cymbales;
  Le cynique baiser cherche à se prodiguer;
  Il semble qu'on pourrait à peine distinguer
  De ces hommes les loups, les chiennes de ces femmes;
  A travers l'ombre, on voit toutes les soifs infâmes,
  Le désir, l'instinct vil, l'ivresse aux cris hagards,
  Flamboyer dans l'étoile horrible des regards.

  Quelque chose de rouge entre les dalles fume;
  Mais, si tiède que soit cette douteuse écume,
  Assez de barils sont éventrés et crevés
  Pour que ce soit du vin qui court sur les pavés.

  Est-ce une vaste noce? est-ce un deuil morne et triste?
  On ne sait pas à quel dénoûment on assiste,
  Si c'est quelque affreux monde à la terre étranger,
  Si l'on voit des vivants ou des larves manger,
  Et si ce qui dans l'ombre indistincte surnage
  Est la fin d'un festin ou la fin d'un carnage.

  Par moments, le tambour, le cistre, le clairon,
  Font ces rages de bruit qui rendaient fou Néron.
  Ce tumulte rugit, chante, boit, mange, râle,
  Sur un trône est assis Ratbert, content et pâle.

  C'est, parmi le butin, les chants, les arcs de fleurs,
  Dans un antre de rois un Louvre de voleurs.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Les grands brasiers, ouvrant leur gouffre d'étincelles,
  Font resplendir les ors d'un chaos de vaisselles;
  On ébrèche aux moutons, aux lièvres montagnards,
  Aux faisans, les couteaux tout à l'heure poignards;
  Sixte Malaspina, derrière le roi, songe;
  Toute lèvre se rue à l'ivresse et s'y plonge;
  On achève un mourant en perçant un tonneau;
  L'oeil croit, parmi les os de chevreuil et d'agneau,
  Aux tremblantes clartés que les flambeaux prolongent,
  Voir des profils humains dans ce que les chiens rongent;
  Des chanteurs grecs, portant des images d'étain
  Sur leurs chapes, selon l'usage byzantin,
  Chantent Ratbert, césar, roi, vainqueur, dieu, génie;
  On entend sous les bancs des soupirs d'agonie;
  Une odeur de tuerie et de cadavres frais
  Se mêle au vague encens brûlant dans les coffrets
  Et les boîtes d'argent sur des trépieds de nacre,
  Les pages, les valets, encor chauds du massacre,
  Servent dans le banquet leur empereur ravi
  Et sombre, après l'avoir dans le meurtre servi;
  Sur le bord des plats d'or on voit des mains sanglantes,
  Ratbert s'accoude avec des poses indolentes;
  Au-dessus du festin, dans le ciel blanc du soir,
  De partout, des hanaps, du buffet, du dressoir,
  Des plateaux où les paons ouvrent leurs larges queues,
  Des écuelles où brûle un philtre aux lueurs bleues,
  Des verres, d'hypocras et de vils écumants,
  Des bouches des buveurs, des bouches des amants,
  S'élève une vapeur gaie, ardente, enflammée,
  Et les âmes des morts sont dans cette fumée.

TOUTES LES FAIMS SATISFAITES

  C'est que les noirs oiseaux de l'ombre ont eu raison,
  C'est que l'orfraie a bien flairé la trahison,
  C'est qu'un fourbe a surpris le vaillant sans défense,
  C'est qu'on vient d'écraser la vieillesse et l'enfance.
  En vain quelques soldats fidèles ont voulu
  Résister, à l'abri d'un créneau vermoulu;
  Tous sont morts; et de sang les dalles sont trempées,
  Et la hache, l'estoc, les masses, les épées
  N'ont fait grâce à pas un, sur l'ordre que donna
  Le roi d'Arle au prévôt Sixte Malaspina.
  Et, quant aux plus mutins, c'est ainsi que les nomme
  L'aventurier royal fait empereur par Rome,
  Trente sur les crochets et douze sur le pal
  Expirent au-dessus du porche principal.

  Tandis qu'en joyeux chants les vainqueurs se répandent,
  Auprès de ces poteaux et de ces croix où pendent
  Ceux que Malaspina vient de supplicier,
  Corbeaux, hiboux, milans, tout l'essaim carnassier,
  Venus des monts, des bois, des cavernes, des havres,
  S'abattent par volée, et font sur les cadavres
  Un banquet, moins hideux que celui d'à côté.

  Ah! le vautour est triste à voir, en vérité,
  Déchiquetant sa proie et planant; on s'effraie
  Du cri de la fauvette aux griffes de l'orfraie;
  L'épervier est affreux rongeant des os brisés;
  Pourtant, par l'ombre immense on les sent excusés,
  L'impénétrable faim est la loi de la terre,
  Et le ciel, qui connaît la grande énigme austère,
  La nuit, qui sert de fond au guet mystérieux
  Du hibou promenant la rondeur de ses yeux
  Ainsi qu'à l'araignée ouvrant ses pâles toiles,
  Met à ce festin sombre une nappe d'étoiles;
  Mais l'être intelligent, le fils d'Adam, l'élu
  Qui doit trouver le bien après l'avoir voulu,
  L'homme exterminant l'homme et riant, épouvante,
  Même au fond de la nuit, l'immensité vivante,
  Et, que le ciel soit noir ou que le ciel soit bleu,
  Caïn tuant Abel est la stupeur de Dieu.

QUE C'EST FABRICE QUI EST UN TRAÎTRE

  Un homme qu'un piquet de lansquenets escorte,
  Qui tient une bannière inclinée, et qui porte
  Une jacque de vair taillée en éventail,
  Un héraut, fait ce cri devant le grand portail:

  'Au nom de l'empereur clément et plein de gloire,
  --Dieu le protège!--peuple! il est pour tous notoire
  Que le traître marquis Fabrice d'Albenga
  Jadis avec les gens des villes se ligna,
  Et qu'il a maintes fois guerroyé le Saint-Siège;
  C'est pourquoi l'empereur très clément,--Dieu protège
  L'empereur!--le citant à son haut tribunal,
  A pris possession de l'état de Final.'

  L'homme ajoute, dressant sa bannière penchée:
  --Qui me contredira, soit sa tête tranchée,
  Et ses biens confisqués à l'empereur. J'ai dit.

SILENCE

  Tout à coup on se tait; ce silence grandit,
  Et l'on dirait qu'au choc brusque d'un vent qui tombe
  Cet enfer a repris sa figure de tombe;
  Ce pandémonium, ivre d'ombre et d'orgueil,
  S'éteint; c'est qu'un vieillard a paru sur le seuil;
  Un prisonnier, un juge, un fantôme; l'ancêtre!

  C'est Fabrice.

                On l'amène à la merci du maître.
  Ses blêmes cheveux blancs couronnent sa pâleur;
  Il a les bras liés au dos comme un voleur;
  Et, pareil au milan qui suit des yeux sa proie,
  Derrière le captif marche, sans qu'il le voie,
  Un homme qui tient haute une épée à deux mains.

  Matha, fixant sur lui ses beaux yeux inhumains,
  Rit sans savoir pourquoi, rire étant son caprice.
  Dix valets de la lance environnent Fabrice.
  Le roi dit:--Le trésor est caché dans un lieu
  Qu'ici tu connais seul, et je jure par Dieu
  Que, si tu dis l'endroit, marquis, ta vie est sauve.

  Fabrice lentement lève sa tête chauve
  Et se tait.

             Le roi dit:--Es-tu sourd, compagnon?

  Un reître avec le doigt fait signe au roi que non.
  --Marquis, parle! ou sinon, vrai comme je me nomme
  Empereur des Romains, roi d'Arle et gentilhomme,
  Lion, tu vas japper ainsi qu'un épagneul.
  Ici, bourreaux!--Réponds, le trésor?

                                      Et l'aïeul
  Semble, droit et glacé parmi les fers de lance,
  Avoir déjà pris place en l'éternel silence.

  Le roi dit:--Préparez les coins et les crampons.
  Pour la troisième fois parleras-tu?  Réponds.

  Fabrice, sans qu'un mot d'entre ses lèvres sorte,
  Regarde le roi d'Arle et d'une telle sorte,
  Avec un si superbe éclair, qu'il l'interdit;
  Et Ratbert, furieux sous ce regard, bondit
  Et crie, en s'arrachant le poil de la moustache
  --Je te trouve idiot et mal en point, et sache
  Que les jouets d'enfant étaient pour toi, vieillard!
  Çà, rends-moi ce trésor, fruit de tes vols, pillard!
  Et ne m'irrite pas, ou ce sera ta faute,
  Et je vais envoyer sur la tour la plus haute
  Ta tête au bout d'un pieu se taire dans la nuit.

  Mais l'aïeul semble d'ombre et de pierre construit;
  On dirait qu'il ne sait pas même qu'on lui parle.

  --Le brodequin! A toi, bourreau! dit le roi d'Arle.

  Le bourreau vient, la foule effarée écoutait.

  On entend l'os crier, mais la bouche se tait.

  Toujours prêt à frapper le prisonnier en traître,
  Le coupe-tête jette un coup d'oeil à son maître.

  --Attends que je te fasse un signe, dit Ratbert.
  Et, reprenant:

               --Voyons, toi chevalier haubert,
  Hais cadet, toi marquis, mais bâtard, si tu donnes
  Ces quelques diamants de plus à mes couronnes,
  Si tu veux me livrer ce trésor, je te fais
  Prince, et j'ai dans mes ports dix galères de Fez
  Dont je te fais présent avec cinq cents esclaves.

  Le vieillard semble sourd et muet.

                                  --Tu me braves!
  Eh bien! tu vas pleurer, dit le fauve empereur.

RATBERT REND L'ENFANT À L'AÏEUL

  Et voici qu'on entend comme un souffle d'horreur
  Frémir, même en cette ombre et même en cette horde.
  Une civière passe, il y pend une corde;
  Un linceul la recouvre; on la pose à l'écart;
  On voit deux pieds d'enfants qui sortent du brancard.
  Fabrice, comme au vent se renverse un grand arbre,
  Tremble, et l'homme de chair sous cette homme de marbre
  Reparaît; et Ratbert fait lever le drap noir.

  C'est elle! Isora! pâle, inexprimable à voir,
  Étranglée; et sa main crispée, et cela navre,
  Tient encore un hochet; pauvre petit cadavre!

  L'aïeul tressaille avec la force d'un géant;
  Formidable, il arrache au brodequin béant
  Son pied dont le bourreau vient de briser le pouce;
  Les bras toujours liés, de l'épaule il repousse
  Tout ce tas de démons, et va jusqu'à l'enfant,
  Et sur ses deux genoux tombe, et son coeur se fend.
  Il crie en se roulant sur la petite morte:

  --Tuée! ils l'ont tuée! et la place était forte,
  Le pont avait sa chaîne et la herse ses poids,
  On avait des fourneaux pour le soufre et la poix,
  On pouvait mordre avec ses dents le roc farouche,
  Se défendre, hurler, lutter, s'emplir la bouche
  De feu, de plomb fondu, d'huile, et les leur cracher
  A la figure avec les éclats du rocher!
  Non!  on a dit:  Entrez, et, par la porte ouverte,
  Ils sont entrés! la vie à la mort s'est offerte!
  On a livré la place, on n'a point combattu!
  Voilà la chose; elle est toute simple; ils n'ont eu
  Affaire qu'à ce vieux misérable imbécile!
  Égorger un enfant, ce n'est pas difficile.
  Tout à l'heure, j'étais tranquille, ayant peu vu
  Qu'on tuât des enfants, et je disais: Pourvu
  Qu'Isora vive, eh bien! après cela, qu'importe?--
  Mais l'enfant!  O mon Dieu! c'est donc vrai qu'elle est morte!
  Penser que nous étions là tous deux hier encor!
  Elle allait et venait dans un gai rayon d'or;
  Cela jouait toujours, pauvre mouche éphémère!
  C'était la petite âme errante de sa mère!
  Le soir, elle posait son doux front sur mon sein,
  Et dormait...--Ah!  brigand!  assassin!  assassin!

  Il se dressait, et tout tremblait dans le repaire,
  Tant c'était la douleur d'un lion et d'un père,
  Le deuil, l'horreur, et tant ce sanglot rugissait!

  --Et moi qui, ce matin, lui nouais son corset!
  Je disais: Fais-toi belle, enfant! Je parais l'ange
  Pour le spectre.--Oh! ris donc là-bas, femme de fange!
  Riez tous! Idiot, en effet, moi qui crois
  Qu'on peut se confier aux paroles des rois
  Et qu'un hôte n'est pas une bête féroce!
  Le roi, les chevaliers, l'évêque avec sa crosse,
  Ils sont venus, j'ai dit: Entrez; c'étaient des loups!
  Est-ce qu'ils ont marché sur elle avec des clous
  Qu'elle est toute meurtrie? Est-ce qu'ils l'ont battue?
  Et voilà maintenant nos filles qu'on nous tue
  Pour voler un vieux casque en vieil or de ducat!
  Je voudrais que quelqu'un d'honnête m'expliquât
  Cet évènement-ci, voilà ma fille morte!
  Dire qu'un empereur vient avec une escorte,
  Et que des gens nommés Farnèse, Spinola,
  Malaspina, Cibo, font de ces choses-là,
  Et qu'on se met à cent, à mille, avec ce prêtre,
  Ces femmes, pour venir prendre un enfant en traître,
  Et que l'enfant est là, mort, et que c'est un jeu;
  C'est à se demander s'il est encore un Dieu,
  Et si, demain, après de si lâches désastres,
  Quelqu'un osera faire encor lever les astres!
  M'avoir assassiné ce petit être-là!
  Mais c'est affreux d'avoir à se mettre cela
  Dans la tête, que c'est fini, qu'ils l'ont tuée,
  Qu'elle est morte!--Oh! ce fils de la prostituée,
  Ce Ratbert, comme il m'a hideusement trompé!
  O Dieu! de quel démon est cet homme échappé?
  Vraiment! est-ce donc trop espérer que de croire
  Qu'on ne va point, par ruse et par trahison noire,
  Massacrer des enfants, broyer des orphelins,
  Des anges, de clarté céleste encor tout pleins?
  Mais c'est qu'elle est là, morte, immobile, insensible!
  je n'aurais jamais cru que cela fût possible.
  Il faut être le fils de cette infâme Agnès!
  Rois! j'avais tort jadis quand je vous épargnais;
  Quand, pouvant vous briser au front le diadème,
  je vous lâchais, j'étais un scélérat moi-même,
  j'étais un meurtrier d'avoir pitié de vous!
  Oui, j'aurais dû vous tordre entre mes serres, tous!
  Est-ce qu'il est permis d'aller dans les abîmes
  Reculer la limite effroyable des crimes
  De voler, oui, ce sont des vols, de faire un tas
  D'abominations, de maux et d'attentats,
  De tuer des enfants et de tuer des femmes,
  Sous prétexte qu'on fut, parmi les oriflammes
  Et les clairons, sacré devant le monde entier
  Par Urbain quatre, pape, et fils d'un savetier?
  Que voulez-vous qu'on fasse à de tels misérables?
  Avoir mis son doigt noir sur ces yeux adorables!
  Ce chef-d'oeuvre du Dieu vivant, l'avoir détruit!
  Quelle mamelle d'ombre et d'horreur et de nuit,
  Dieu juste, a donc été de ce monstre nourrice?
  Un tel homme suffit pour qu'un siècle pourrisse.
  Plus de bien ni de mal, plus de droit, plus de lois.
  Est-ce que le tonnerre est absent quelquefois?
  Est-ce qu'il n'est pas temps que la foudre se prouve,
  Cieux profonds, en broyant ce chien, fils de la louve?
  Oh! sois maudit, maudit, maudit, et sois maudit,
  Ratbert, empereur, roi, césar, escroc, bandit!
  O grand vainqueur d'enfants de cinq ans! maudits soient
  Les pas que font tes pieds, les jours que tes yeux voient,
  Et la gueuse qui t'offre en riant son sein nu,
  Et ta mère publique, et ton père inconnu!
  Terre et cieux! c'est pourtant bien le moins qu'un doux être
  Qui joue à notre porte et sous notre fenêtre,
  Qui ne fait rien que rire et courir dans les fleurs,
  Et qu'emplir de soleil nos pauvres yeux en pleurs,
  Ait le droit de jouir de l'aube qui l'enivre,
  Puisque les empereurs laissent les forçats vivre,
  Et puisque Dieu, témoin des deuils et des horreurs,
  Laisse sous le ciel noir vivre les empereurs!'

LES DEUX TÊTES

  Ratbert en ce moment, distrait jusqu'à sourire,
  Écoutait Afranus à voix basse lui dire:
  --Majesté, le caveau du trésor est trouvé.

  L'aïeul pleurait.

                   --Un chien, au coin des murs crevé,
  Est un être enviable auprès de moi. Va, pille,
  Vole, égorge, empereur! O ma petite fille,
  Parle-moi! Rendez-moi mon doux ange, ô mon Dieu!
  Elle ne va donc pas me regarder un peu?
  Mon enfant! Tous les jours nous allions dans les lierres.
  Tu disais: Vois les fleurs, et moi. Prends garde aux pierres!
  Et je la regardais, et je crois qu'un rocher
  Se fût attendri rien qu'en la voyant marcher.
  Hélas! avoir eu foi dans ce monstrueux drôle!
  Mets ta tête adorée auprès de mon épaule.
  Est-ce que tu m'en veux? C'est moi qui suis là! Dis,
  Tu n'ouvriras donc plus tes yeux du paradis!
  Je n'entendrai donc plus ta voix, pauvre petite!
  Tout ce qui me tenait aux entrailles me quitte;
  Et ce sera mon sort, à moi, le vieux vainqueur,
  Qu'à deux reprises Dieu m'ait arraché le coeur,
  Et qu'il ait retiré de ma poitrine amère
  L'enfant, après m'avoir ôté du flanc la mère!
  Mon Dieu, pourquoi m'avoir pris cet être si doux?
  Je n'étais pourtant pas révolté contre vous,
  Et je consentais presque à ne plus avoir qu'elle.
  Morte! et moi, je suis là, stupide qui l'appelle!
  Oh! si je n'avais pas les bras liés, je crois
  Que je réchaufferais ses pauvres membres froids.
  Comme ils l'ont fait souffrir! La corde l'a coupée.
  Elle saigne.

             Ratbert, blême et la main crispée,
  Le voyant à genoux sur son ange dormant,
  Dit:--Porte-glaive, il est ainsi commodément.

  Le porte-glaive fit, n'étant qu'un misérable,
  Tomber sur l'enfant mort la tête vénérable.

  Et voici ce qu'on vit dans ce même instant-là:
  La tête de Ratbert sur le pavé roula,
  Hideuse, comme si le même coup d'épée,
  Frappant deux fois, l'avait avec l'autre coupée.

  L'horreur fut inouïe; et tous, se retournant,
  Sur le grand fauteuil d'or du trône rayonnant
  Aperçurent le corps de l'empereur sans tête,
  Et son cou d'où sortait, dans un bruit de tempête,
  Un flot rouge, un sanglot de pourpre, éclaboussant
  Les convives, le trône et la table, de sang.
  Alors dans la clarté d'abîme et de vertige
  Qui marque le passage énorme d'un prodige,
  Des deux têtes on vit l'une, celle du roi,
  Entrer sous terre et fuir dans le gouffre d'effroi
  Dont l'expiation formidable est la règle,
  Et l'autre s'envoler avec des ailes d'aigle.

APRÈS JUSTICE FAITE

  L'ombre couvre à présent Ratbert, l'homme de nuit.
  Nos pères--c'est ainsi qu'un nom s'évanouit--
  Défendaient d'en parler, et du mur de l'histoire
  Les ans ont effacé cette vision noire.

  Le glaive qui frappa ne fut point aperçu;
  D'où vint ce sombre coup, personne ne l'a su;
  Seulement, ce soir-là, bêchant pour se distraire,
  Héraclius le Chauve, abbé de Joug-Dieu, frère
  D'Acceptus, archevêque et primat de Lyon,
  Étant aux champs avec le diacre Pollion,
  Vit, dans les profondeurs par les vents remuées,
  Un archange essuyer son épée aux nuées.


LA ROSE DE L'INFANTE

  Elle est toute petite, une duègne la garde.
  Elle tient à la main une rose, et regarde.
  Quoi? que regarde-t-elle? Elle ne sait pas. L'eau,
  Un bassin qu'assombrit le pin et le bouleau;
  Ce qu'elle a devant elle; un cygne aux ailes blanches,
  Le bercement des flots sous la chanson des branches,
  Et le profond jardin rayonnant et fleuri.
  Tout ce bel ange a l'air dans la neige pétri.
  On voit un grand palais comme au fond d'une gloire,
  Un parc, de clairs viviers où les biches vont boire,
  Et des paons étoilés sous les bois chevelus.
  L'innocence est sur elle une blancheur de plus;
  Toutes ses grâces font comme un faisceau qui tremble.
  Autour de cette enfant l'herbe est splendide et semble
  Pleine de vrais rubis et de diamants fins;
  Un jet de saphirs sort des bouches des dauphins.
  Elle se tient au bord de l'eau; sa fleur l'occupe.
  Sa basquine est en point de Gênes; sur sa jupe
  Une arabesque, errant dans les plis du satin,
  Suit les mille détours d'un fil d'or florentin.
  La rose épanouie et toute grande ouverte,
  Sortant du frais bouton comme d'une urne ouverte,
  Charge la petitesse exquise de sa main;
  Quand l'enfant, allongeant ses lèvres de carmin,
  Fronce, en la respirant, sa riante narine,
  La magnifique fleur, royale et purpurine,
  Cache plus qu'à demi ce visage charmant,
  Si bien que l'oeil hésite, et qu'on ne sait comment
  Distinguer de la fleur ce bel enfant qui joue,
  Et si l'on voit la rose ou si l'on voit la joue.
  Ses yeux bleus sont plus beaux sous son pur sourcil brun.
  En elle tout est joie, enchantement, parfum;
  Quel doux regard, l'azur! et quel doux nom, Marie!
  Tout est rayon: son oeil éclaire et son nom prie.
  Pourtant, devant la vie et sous le firmament,
  Pauvre être! elle se sent très grande vaguement;
  Elle assiste au printemps, à la lumière, à l'ombre,
  Au grand soleil couchant horizontal et sombre,
  A la magnificence éclatante du soir,
  Aux ruisseaux murmurants qu'on entend sans les voir,
  Aux champs, à la nature éternelle et sereine,
  Avec la gravité d'une petite reine;
  Elle n'a jamais vu l'homme que se courbant;
  Un jour, elle sera duchesse de Brabant;
  Elle gouvernera la Flandre ou la Sardaigne.
  Elle est l'infante, elle a cinq ans, elle dédaigne.
  Car les enfants des rois sont ainsi; leurs fronts blancs
  Portent un cercle d'ombre, et leurs pas chancelants
  Sont des commencements de règne. Elle respire
  Sa fleur en attendant qu'on lui cueille un empire;
  Et son regard, déjà royal, dit: C'est à moi.
  Il sort d'elle un amour mêlé d'un vague effroi.
  Si quelqu'un, la voyant si tremblante et si frêle,
  Fût-ce pour la sauver mettait la main sur elle,
  Avant qu'il eût pu faire un pas ou dire un mot,
  Il aurait sur le front l'ombre de l'échafaud.

  La douce enfant sourit, ne faisant autre chose
  Que de vivre et d'avoir dans la main une rose,
  Et d'être là devant le ciel, parmi les fleurs.

  Le jour s'éteint; les nids chuchotent, querelleurs;
  Les pourpres du couchant sont dans les branches d'arbre;
  La rougeur monte au front des déesses de marbre
  Qui semblent palpiter sentant venir la nuit;
  Et tout ce qui planait redescend; plus de bruit,
  Plus de flamme; le soir mystérieux recueille
  Le soleil sous la vague et l'oiseau sous la feuille.

  Pendant que l'enfant rit, cette fleur à la main,
  Dans le vaste palais catholique romain
  Dont chaque ogive semble au soleil une mitre,
  Quelqu'un de formidable est derrière la vitre;
  On voit d'en bas une ombre, au fond d'une vapeur,
  De fenêtre en fenêtre errer, et l'on a peur;
  Cette ombre au même endroit, comme en un cimetière,
  Parfois est immobile une journée entière;
  C'est un être effrayant qui semble ne rien voir;
  Il rôde d'une chambre à l'autre, pâle et noir;
  Il colle aux vitraux blancs son front lugubre, et songe.
  Spectre blême! Son ombre aux feux du soir s'allonge;
  Son pas funèbre est lent, comme un glas de beffroi;
  Et c'est la Mort, à moins que ce ne soit le Roi.

  C'est lui; l'homme en qui vit et tremble le royaume.
  Si quelqu'un pouvait voir dans l'oeil de ce fantôme,
  Debout en ce moment l'épaule contre un mur,
  Ce qu'on apercevrait dans cet abîme obscur,
  Ce n'est pas l'humble enfant, le jardin, l'eau moirée
  Reflétant le ciel d'or d'une claire soirée,
  Les bosquets, les oiseaux se becquetant entre eux.
  Non; au fond de cet oeil, comme l'onde vitreux,
  Sous ce fatal sourcil qui dérobe à la sonde
  Cette prunelle autant que l'océan profonde,
  Ce qu'on distinguerait, c'est, mirage mouvant,
  Tout un vol de vaisseaux en fuite dans le vent,
  Et, dans l'écume, au pli des vagues, sous l'étoile,
  L'immense tremblement d'une flotte à la voile,
  Et, là-bas, sous la brume, une île, un blanc rocher,
  Écoutant sur les flots ces tonnerres marcher.

  Telle est la vision qui, dans l'heure où nous sommes,
  Emplit le froid cerveau de ce maître des hommes,
  Et qui fait qu'il ne peut rien voir autour de lui.
  L'armada, formidable et flottant point d'appui
  Du levier dont il va soulever tout un monde,
  Traverse en ce moment l'obscurité de l'onde;
  Le roi, dans son esprit, la suit des yeux, vainqueur,
  Et son tragique ennui n'a plus d'autre lueur.

  Philippe deux était une chose terrible.
  Iblis dans le Coran et Caïn dans la Bible
  Sont à peine aussi noirs qu'en son Escurial
  Ce royal spectre, fils du spectre impérial.
  Philippe deux était le Mal tenant le glaive.
  Il occupait le haut du monde comme un rêve.
  Il vivait; nul n'osait le regarder; l'effroi
  Faisait une lumière étrange autour du roi;
  On tremblait rien qu'à voir passer ses majordomes;
  Tant il se confondait, aux yeux troublés des hommes,
  Avec l'abîme, avec les astres du ciel bleu!
  Tant semblait grande à tous son approche de Dieu!
  Sa volonté fatale, enfoncée, obstinée,
  Était comme un crampon mis sur la destinée;
  Il tenait l'Amérique et l'Inde, il s'appuyait
  Sur l'Afrique, il régnait sur l'Europe, inquiet
  Seulement du côté de la sombre Angleterre;
  Sa bouche était silence et son âme mystère;
  Son trône était de piège et de fraude construit;
  Il avait pour soutien la force de la nuit;
  L'ombre était le cheval de sa statue équestre.
  Toujours vêtu de noir, ce tout-puissant terrestre
  Avait l'air d'être en deuil de ce qu'il existait;
  Il ressemblait au sphinx qui digère et se tait,
  Immuable; étant tout, il n'avait rien à dire.
  Nul n'avait vu ce roi sourire; le sourire
  N'étant pas plus possible à ces lèvres de fer
  Que l'aurore à la grille obscure de l'enfer.
  S'il secouait parfois sa torpeur de couleuvre,
  C'était pour assister le bourreau dans son oeuvre,
  Et sa prunelle avait pour clarté le reflet
  Des bûchers sur lesquels par moments il soufflait.
  Il était redoutable à la pensée, à l'homme,
  A la vie, au progrès, au droit, dévot à Rome;
  C'était Satan régnant au nom de Jésus-Christ;
  Les choses qui sortaient de son nocturne esprit
  Semblaient un glissement sinistre de vipères.
  L'Escurial, Burgos, Aranjuez, ses repaires,
  Jamais n'illuminaient leurs livides plafonds;
  Pas de festins, jamais de cour, pas de bouffons;
  Les trahisons pour jeu, l'auto-da-fé pour fête.
  Les rois troublés avaient au-dessus de leur tête
  Ses projets dans la nuit obscurément ouverts;
  Sa rêverie était un poids sur l'univers;
  Il pouvait et voulait tout vaincre et tout dissoudre;
  Sa prière faisait le bruit sourd d'une foudre;
  De grands éclairs sortaient de ses songes profonds.
  Ceux auxquels il pensait disaient: Nous étouffons.
  Et les peuples, d'un bout à l'autre de l'empire,
  Tremblaient, sentant sur eux ces deux yeux fixes luire.

  Charles fut le vautour, Philippe est le hibou.

  Morne en son noir pourpoint, la toison d'or au cou,
  On dirait du destin la froide sentinelle;
  Son immobilité commande; sa prunelle
  Luit comme un soupirail de caverne; son doigt
  Semble, ébauchant un geste obscur que nul ne voit,
  Donner un ordre à l'ombre et vaguement l'écrire.
  Chose inouïe! il vient de grincer un sourire.
  Un sourire insondable, impénétrable, amer.
  C'est que la vision de son armée en mer
  Grandit de plus en plus dans sa sombre pensée;
  C'est qu'il la voit voguer par son dessein poussée,
  Comme s'il était là, planant sous le zénith;
  Tout est bien; l'océan docile s'aplanit,
  L'armada lui fait peur comme au déluge l'arche;
  La flotte se déploie en bon ordre de marche,
  Et, les vaisseaux gardant les espaces fixés,
  Échiquier de tillacs, de ponts, de mâts dressés,
  Ondule sur les eaux comme une immense claie.
  Ces vaisseaux sont sacrés, les flots leur font la haie;
  Les courants, pour aider les nefs à débarquer,
  Ont leur besogne à faire et n'y sauraient manquer;
  Autour d'elles la vague avec amour déferle,
  L'écueil se change en port, l'écume tombe en perle
  Voici chaque galère avec son gastadour;
  Voilà ceux de l'Escaut, voilà ceux de l'Adour;
  Les cent mestres de camp et les deux connétables;
  L'Allemagne a donné ses ourques redoutables,
  Naples ses brigantins, Cadix ses galions,
  Lisbonne ses marins, car il faut des lions.
  Et Philippe se penche, et, qu'importe l'espace?
  Non seulement il voit, mais il entend. On passe,
  On court, on va. Voici le cri des porte-voix,
  Le pas des matelots courant sur les pavois,
  Les mocos, l'amiral appuyé sur son page,
  Les tambours, les sifflets des maîtres d'équipage,
  Les signaux pour la mer, l'appel pour les combats,
  Le fracas sépulcral et noir du branle-bas.
  Sont-ce des cormorans? sont-ce des citadelles?
  Les voiles font un vaste et sourd battement d'ailes;
  L'eau gronde, et tout ce groupe énorme vogue, et fuit,
  Et s'enfle et roule avec un prodigieux bruit.
  Et le lugubre roi sourit de voir groupées
  Sur quatre cents navires quatre-vingt mille épées.
  O rictus du vampire assouvissant sa faim!
  Cette pâle Angleterre, il la tient donc enfin!
  Qui pourrait la sauver? Le feu va prendre aux poudres.
  Philippe dans sa droite a la gerbe des foudres;
  Qui pourrait délier ce faisceau dans son poing?
  N'est-il pas le seigneur qu'on ne contredit point?
  N'est-il pas l'héritier de César? le Philippe
  Dont l'ombre immense va du Gange au Pausilippe?
  Tout n'est-il pas fini quand il a dit: Je veux!
  N'est-ce pas lui qui tient la victoire aux cheveux?
  N'est-ce pas lui qui lance en avant cette flotte,
  Ces vaisseaux effrayants dont il est le pilote
  Et que la mer charrie ainsi qu'elle le doit?
  Ne fait-il pas mouvoir avec son petit doigt
  Toits ces dragons ailés et noirs, essaim sans nombre?
  N'est-il pas, lui, le roi? n'est-il pas l'homme sombre
  A qui ce tourbillon de monstres obéit?
  Quand Béit-Cifresil, fils d'Abdallah-Béit,
  Eut creusé le grand puits de la mosquée, au Caire,
  Il y grava: 'Le ciel est à Dieu; j'ai la terre.'
  Et, comme tout se tient, se mêle et se confond,
  Tous les tyrans n'étant qu'un seul despote au fond,
  Ce que dit ce sultan jadis, ce roi le pense.

  Cependant, sur le bord du bassin, en silence,
  L'infante tient toujours sa rose gravement,
  Et, doux ange aux yeux bleus, la baise par moment.
  Soudain un souffle d'air, une de ces haleines
  Que le soir frémissant jette à travers les plaines,
  Tumultueux zéphyr effleurant l'horizon,
  Trouble l'eau, fait frémir les joncs, met un frisson
  Dans les lointains massifs de myrte et d'asphodèle,
  Vient jusqu'au bel enfant tranquille, et, d'un coup d'aile,
  Rapide, et secouant même l'arbre voisin,
  Effeuille brusquement la fleur dans le bassin,
  Et l'infante n'a plus dans la main qu'une épine.
  Elle se penche, et voit sur l'eau cette ruine;
  Elle ne comprend pas; qu'est-ce donc? Elle a peur;
  Et la voilà qui cherche au ciel avec stupeur
  Cette brise qui n'a pas craint de lui déplaire.
  Que faire? le bassin semble plein de colère;
  Lui, si clair tout à l'heure, il est noir maintenant;
  Il a des vagues; c'est une mer bouillonnant;
  Toute la pauvre rose est éparse sur l'onde;
  Ses cent feuilles que noie et roule l'eau profonde,
  Tournoyant, naufrageant, s'en vont de tous côtés
  Sur mille petits flots par la brise irrités;
  On croit voir dans un gouffre une flotte qui sombre.
  --'Madame,' dit la duègne avec sa face d'ombre
  A la petite fille étonnée et rêvant,
  'Tout sur terre appartient aux princes, hors le vent.'



LES RAISONS DU MOMOTOMBO

  Trouvant les tremblements de terre trop fréquents,
  Les rois d'Espagne ont fait baptiser les volcans
  Du royaume qu'ils ont en dessous de la sphère;
  Les volcans n'ont rien dit et se sont laissé faire,
  Et le Momotombo lui seul n'a pas voulu.
  Plus d'un prêtre en surplis, par le Saint-Père élu,
  Portant le sacrement que l'Église administre,
  L'oeil au ciel, a monté la montagne sinistre;
  Beaucoup y sont allés, pas un n'est revenu.

  O vieux Momotombo, colosse chauve et nu,
  Qui songes près des mers, et fais de ton cratère
  Une tiare d'ombre et de flamme à la terre,
  Pourquoi, lorsqu'à ton seuil terrible nous frappons,
  Ne veux-tu pas du Dieu qu'on t'apporte? Réponds.

  La montagne interrompt son crachement de lave,
  Et le Momotombo répond d'une voix grave:

  --Je n'aimais pas beaucoup le dieu qu'on a chassé.
  Cet avare cachait de l'or dans un fossé;
  Il mangeait de la chair humaine; ses mâchoires
  Étaient de pourriture et de sang toutes noires;
  Son antre était un porche au farouche carreau,
  Temple-sépulcre orné d'un pontife-bourreau;
  Des squelettes riaient sous ses pieds; les écuelles
  Où cet être buvait le meurtre étaient cruelles;
  Sourd, difforme, il avait des serpents au poignet;
  Toujours entre ses dents un cadavre saignait;
  Ce spectre noircissait le firmament sublime.
  J'en grondais quelquefois au fond de mon abîme.
  Aussi, quand sont venus, fiers sur les flots tremblants,
  Et du côté d'où vient le jour, des hommes blancs,
  Je les ai bien reçus, trouvant que c'était sage.
  L'âme a certainement la couleur du visage,
  Disais-je, l'homme blanc, c'est comme le ciel bleu,
  Et le dieu de ceux-ci doit être un très bon dieu.
  On ne le verra point de meurtres se repaître.--
  J'étais content; j'avais horreur de l'ancien prêtre.
  Mais quand j'ai vu comment travaille le nouveau,
  Quand j'ai vu flamboyer, ciel juste! à mon niveau,
  Cette torche lugubre, âpre, jamais éteinte,
  Sombre, que vous nommez l'Inquisition sainte;
  Quand j'ai pu voir comment Torquemada s'y prend
  Pour dissiper la nuit du sauvage ignorant,
  Comment il civilise, et de quelle manière
  Le saint office enseigne et fait de la lumière;
  Quand j'ai vu dans Lima d'affreux géants d'osier,
  Pleins d'enfants, pétiller sur un large brasier,
  Et le feu dévorer la vie, et les fumées
  Se tordre sur les seins des femmes allumées;
  Quand je me suis senti parfois presque étouffé
  Par l'âcre odeur qui sort de votre auto-da-fé,
  Moi qui ne brûlais rien que l'ombre en ma fournaise,
  J'ai pensé que j'avais eu tort d'être bien aise;
  J'ai regardé de près le dieu de l'étranger,
  Et j'ai dit:--Ce n'est pas la peine de changer.

APRÈS LA BATAILLE

  Mon père, ce héros au sourire si doux,
  Suivi d'un seul housard qu'il aimait entre tous
  Pour sa grande bravoure et pour sa haute taille,
  Parcourait à cheval, le soir d'une bataille,
  Le champ couvert de morts sur qui tombait la nuit.
  Il lui sembla dans l'ombre entendre un faible bruit.
  C'était un Espagnol de l'armée en déroute
  Qui se traînait sanglant sur le bord de la route,
  Râlant, brisé, livide, et mort plus qu'à moitié,
  Et qui disait:--A boire, à boire par pitié!--
  Mon père, ému, tendit à son housard fidèle
  Une gourde de rhum qui pendait à sa selle,
  Et dit:--Tiens, donne à boire à ce pauvre blessé.--
  Tout à coup, au moment où le housard baissé
  Se penchait vers lui, l'homme, une espèce de Maure,
  Saisit un pistolet qu'il étreignait encore,
  Et vise au front mon père en criant: Caramba!
  Le coup passa si près que le chapeau tomba
  Et que le cheval fit un écart en arrière.
  --Donne-lui tout de même à boire, dit mon père.




LE CRAPAUD

  Que savons-nous? qui donc connaît le fond des choses?
  Le couchant rayonnait dans les nuages roses;
  C'était la fin d'un jour d'orage, et l'occident
  Changeait l'ondée en flamme en son brasier ardent;
  Près d'une ornière, au bord d'une flaque de pluie,
  Un crapaud regardait le ciel, bête éblouie;
  Grave, il songeait; l'horreur contemplait la splendeur.
  (Oh!  pourquoi la souffrance et pourquoi la laideur?
  Hélas! le bas-empire est couvert d'Augustules,
  Les Césars de forfaits, les crapauds de pustules,
  Comme le pré de fleurs et le ciel de soleils!)
  Les feuilles s'empourpraient dans les arbres vermeils;
  L'eau miroitait, mêlée à l'herbe, dans l'ornière;
  Le soir se déployait ainsi qu'une bannière;
  L'oiseau baissait la voix dans le jour affaibli;
  Tout s'apaisait, dans l'air, sur l'onde; et, plein d'oubli,
  Le crapaud, sans effroi, sans honte, sans colère,
  Doux, regardait la grande auréole solaire.
  Peut-être le maudit se sentait-il béni;
  Pas de bête qui n'ait un reflet d'infini;
  Pas de prunelle abjecte et vile que ne touche
  L'éclair d'en haut, parfois tendre et parfois farouche;
  Pas de monstre chétif, louche, impur, chassieux,
  Qui n'ait l'immensité des astres dans les yeux.
  Un homme qui passait vit la hideuse bête,
  Et, frémissant, lui mit son talon sur la tête;
  C'etait un prêtre ayant un livre qu'il lisait;
  Puis une femme, avec une fleur au corset,
  Vint et lui creva l'oeil du bout de son ombrelle;
  Et le prêtre était vieux, et la femme était belle.
  Vinrent quatre écoliers, sereins comme le ciel.
  --J'étais enfant, j'étais petit, j'étais cruel;--
  Tout homme sur la terre, où l'âme erre asservie,
  Peut commencer ainsi le récit de sa vie.
  On a le jeu, l'ivresse et l'aube dans les yeux,
  On a sa mère, on est des écoliers joyeux,
  De petits hommes gais, respirant l'atmosphère
  A pleins poumons, aimés, libres, contents; que faire,
  Sinon de torturer quelque être malheureux?
  Le crapaud se traînait au fond du chemin creux.
  C'était l'heure où des champs les profondeurs s'azurent.
  Fauve, il cherchait la nuit; les enfants l'aperçurent
  Et crièrent:--Tuons ce vilain animal,
  Et, puisqu'il est si laid, faisons-lui bien du mal!--
  Et chacun d'eux, riant,--l'enfant rit quand il tue,--
  Se mit à le piquer d'une branche pointue,
  Élargissant le trou de l'oeil crevé, blessant
  Les blessures, ravis, applaudis du passant;
  Car les passants riaient; et l'ombre sépulcrale
  Couvrait ce noir martyr qui n'a pas même un râle,
  Et le sang, sang affreux, de toutes parts coulait
  Sur ce pauvre être ayant pour crime d'être laid;
  Il fuyait; il avait une patte arrachée;
  Un enfant le frappait d'une pelle ébréchée;
  Et chaque coup faisait écumer ce proscrit
  Qui, même quand le jour sur sa tête sourit,
  Même sous le grand ciel, rampe au fond d'une cave;
  Et les enfants disaient: Est-il méchant! il bave!
  Son front saignait; son oeil pendait; dans le genêt
  Et la ronce, effroyable à voir, il cheminait;
  On eût dit qu'il sortait de quelque affreuse serre.
  Oh! la sombre action, empirer la misère!
  Ajouter de l'horreur à la difformité!
  Disloqué, de cailloux en cailloux cahoté,
  Il respirait toujours; sans abri, sans asile,
  Il rampait; on eût dit que la mort, difficile,
  Le trouvait si hideux qu'elle le refusait;
  Les enfants le voulaient saisir dans un lacet,
  Mais il leur échappa, glissant le long des haies;
  L'ornière était béante, il y traîna ses plaies
  Et s'y plongea sanglant, brisé, le crâne ouvert,
  Sentant quelque fraîcheur dans ce cloaque vert,
  Lavant la cruauté de l'homme en cette boue;
  Et les enfants, avec le printemps sur la joue,
  Blonds, charmants, ne s'étaient jamais tant divertis.
  Tous parlaient à la fois, et les grands aux petits
  Criaient: Viens voir! dis donc, Adolphe, dis donc, Pierre,
  Allons pour l'achever prendre une grosse pierre!
  Tous ensemble, sur l'être au hasard exécré,
  Ils fixaient leurs regards, et le désespéré
  Regardait s'incliner sur lui ces fronts horribles.
  --Hélas! ayons des buts, mais n'ayons pas de cibles;
  Quand nous visons un point de l'horizon humain,
  Ayons la vie, et non la mort, dans notre main.--
  Tous les yeux poursuivaient le crapaud dans la vase;
  C'était de la fureur et c'était de l'extase;
  Un des enfants revint, apportant un pavé
  Pesant, mais pour le mal aisément soulevé,
  Et dit:--Nous allons voir comment cela va faire.--
  Or, en ce même instant, juste à ce point de terre,
  Le hasard amenait un chariot très lourd
  Traîné par un vieux âne écloppé, maigre et sourd;
  Cet âne harassé, boiteux et lamentable,
  Après un jour de marche approchait de l'étable;
  Il roulait la charrette et portait un panier;
  Chaque pas qu'il faisait semblait l'avant-dernier;
  Cette bête marchait, battue, exténuée;
  Les coups l'enveloppaient ainsi qu'une nuée;
  Il avait dans ses yeux voilés d'une vapeur
  Cette stupidité qui peut-être est stupeur;
  Et l'ornière était creuse, et si pleine de boue
  Et d'un versant si dur, que chaque tour de roue
  Était comme un lugubre et rauque arrachement;
  Et l'âne allait geignant et l'ânier blasphémant;
  La route descendait et poussait la bourrique;
  L'âne songeait, passif, sous le fouet, sous la trique,
  Dans une profondeur où l'homme ne va pas.

  Les enfants, entendant cette roue et ce pas,
  Se tournèrent bruyants et virent la charrette:
  --Ne mets pas le pavé sur le crapaud. Arrête!
  Crièrent-ils. Vois-tu, la voiture descend
  Et va passer dessus, c'est bien plus amusant.

  Tous regardaient.

                  Soudain, avançant dans l'ornière

  Où le monstre attendait sa torture dernière,
  L'âne vit le crapaud, et, triste,--hélas! penché
  Sur un plus triste,--lourd, rompu, morne, écorché,
  Il sembla le flairer avec sa tête basse;
  Ce forçat, ce damné, ce patient, fit grâce;
  Il rassembla sa force éteinte, et, roidissant
  Sa chaîne et son licou sur ses muscles en sang,
  Résistant à l'ânier qui lui criait: Avance!
  Maîtrisant du fardeau l'affreuse connivence,
  Avec sa lassitude acceptant le combat,
  Tirant le chariot et soulevant le bât,
  Hagard il détourna la roue inexorable,
  Laissant derrière lui vivre ce misérable;
  Puis, sous un coup de fouet, il reprit son chemin.

  Alors, lâchant la pierre échappée à sa main,
  Un des enfants--celui qui conte cette histoire--
  Sous la voûte infinie à la fois bleue et noire,
  Entendit une voix qui lui disait: Sois bon!

  Bonté de l'idiot! diamant du charbon!
  Sainte énigme! lumière auguste des ténèbres!
  Les célestes n'ont rien de plus que les funèbres,
  Si les funèbres, groupe aveugle et châtié,
  Songent, et, n'ayant pas la joie, ont la pitié.
  O spectacle sacré! l'ombre secourant l'ombre,
  L'âme obscure venant en aide à l'âme sombre,
  Le stupide, attendri, sur l'affreux se penchant,
  Le damné bon faisant rêver l'élu méchant!
  L'animal avançant lorsque l'homme recule!
  Dans la sérénité du pâle crépuscule,
  La brute par moments pense et sent qu'elle est soeur
  De la mystérieuse et profonde douceur;
  Il suffit qu'un éclair de grâce brille en elle
  Pour qu'elle soit égale à l'étoile éternelle:
  Le baudet qui, rentrant le soir, surchargé, las,
  Mourant, sentant saigner ses pauvres sabots plats,
  Fait quelques pas de plus, s'écarte et se dérange
  Pour ne pas écraser un crapaud dans la fange,
  Cet âne abject, souillé, meurtri sous le bâton,
  Est plus saint que Socrate et plus grand que Platon.
  Tu cherches, philosophe? O penseur, tu médites?
  Veux-tu trouver le vrai sous nos brumes maudites?
  Crois, pleure, abîme-toi dans l'insondable amour!
  Quiconque est bon voit clair dans l'obscur carrefour;
  Quiconque est bon habite un coin du ciel. O sage,
  La bonté, qui du monde éclaire le visage,
  La bonté, ce regard du matin ingénu,
  La bonté, pur rayon qui chauffe l'inconnu,
  Instinct qui dans la nuit et dans la souffrance aime,
  Est le trait d'union ineffable et suprême
  Qui joint, dans l'ombre, hélas! si lugubre souvent,
  Le grand ignorant, l'âne, à Dieu, le grand savant.


LES PAUVRES GENS

I

  Il est nuit. La cabane est pauvre, mais bien close.
  Le logis est plein d'ombre, et l'on sent quelque chose
  Qui rayonne à travers ce crépuscule obscur.
  Des filets de pêcheur sont accrochés au mur.
  Au fond, dans l'encoignure où quelque humble vaisselle
  Aux planches d'un bahut vaguement étincelle,
  On distingue un grand lit aux longs rideaux tombants.
  Tout près, un matelas s'étend sur de vieux bancs,
  Et cinq petits enfants, nid d'âmes, y sommeillent.
  La haute cheminée où quelques flammes veillent
  Rougit le plafond sombre, et, le front sur le lit,
  Une femme à genoux prie, et songe et pâlit.
  C'est la mère. Elle est seule. Et dehors, blanc d'écume,
  Au ciel, aux vents, aux rocs, à la nuit, à la brume,
  Le sinistre océan jette son noir sanglot.


II

  L'homme est en mer. Depuis l'enfance matelot,
  Il livre au hasard sombre une rude bataille.
  Pluie ou bourrasque, il faut qu'il sorte, il faut qu'il aille,
  Car les petits enfants ont faim. Il part le soir,
  Quand l'eau profonde monte aux marches du musoir.
  Il gouverne à lui seul sa barque à quatre voiles.
  La femme est au logis, cousant les vieilles toiles,
  Remmaillant les filets, préparant l'hameçon,
  Surveillant l'âtre où bout la soupe de poisson,
  Puis priant Dieu sitôt que les cinq enfants dorment.
  Lui, seul, battu des flots qui toujours se reforment,
  Il s'en va dans l'abîme et s'en va dans la nuit.
  Dur labeur! tout est noir, tout est froid; rien ne luit.
  Dans les brisants, parmi les lames en démence;
  L'endroit bon à la pêche, et, sur la mer immense,
  Le lieu mobile, obscur, capricieux, changeant,
  Où se plaît le poisson aux nageoires d'argent,
  Ce n'est qu'un point; c'est grand deux fois comme la chambre.
  Or, la nuit, dans l'ondée et la brume, en décembre,
  Pour rencontrer ce point sur le désert mouvant,
  Comme il faut calculer la marée et le vent!
  Comme il faut combiner sûrement les manoeuvres!
  Les flots le long du bord glissent, vertes couleuvres;
  Le gouffre roule et tord ses plis démesurés
  Et fait râler d'horreur les agrès effarés.
  Lui songe à sa Jeannie, au sein des mers glacées,
  Et Jeannie en pleurant l'appelle; et leurs pensées
  Se croisent dans la nuit, divins oiseaux du coeur.


III

  Elle prie, et la mauve au cri rauque et moqueur
  L'importune, et, parmi les écueils en décombres,
  L'océan l'épouvante, et toutes sortes d'ombres
  Passent dans son esprit, la mer, les matelots
  Emportés à travers la colère des flots.
  Et dans sa gaîne, ainsi que le sang dans l'artère,
  La froide horloge bat, jetant dans le mystère,
  Goutte à goutte, le temps, saisons, printemps, hivers;
  Et chaque battement, dans l'énorme univers,
  Ouvre aux âmes, essaims d'autours et de colombes,
  D'un côté les berceaux et de l'autre les tombes.
  Elle songe, elle rêve,--et tant de pauvreté!
  Ses petits vont pieds nus l'hiver comme l'été.
  Pas de pain de froment. On marge du pain d'orge.
  --O Dieu! le vent rugit comme un soufflet de forge,
  La côte fait le brut d'une enclume, on croit voir
  Les constellations fuir dans l'ouragan noir
  Comme les tourbillons d'étincelles de l'âtre.
  C'est l'heure où, gai danseur, minuit rit et folâtre
  Sous le loup de satin qu'illuminent ses yeux,
  Et c'est l'heure où minuit, brigand mystérieux,
  Voilé d'ombre et de pluie et le front dans la bise,
  Prend un pauvre marin frissonnant et le brise
  Aux rochers monstrueux apparus brusquement.--
  Horreur! l'homme dont l'onde éteint le hurlement
  Sent fondre et s'enfoncer le bâtiment qui plonge;
  Il sent s'ouvrir sous lui l'ombre et l'abîme, et songe
  Au vieil anneau de fer du quai plein de soleil!

  Ces mornes visions troublent son coeur, pareil
  A la nuit. Elle tremble et pleure.


IV

                                    O pauvres femmes
  De pêcheurs! c'est affreux de se dire: Mes âmes,
  Père, amant, frères, fils, tout ce que j'ai de cher,
  C'est là, dans ce chaos! mon coeur, mon sang, ma chair!--
  Ciel! être en proie aux flots, c'est être en proie aux bêtes.
  Oh! songer que l'eau joue avec toutes ces têtes,
  Depuis le mousse enfant jusqu'au mari patron,
  Et que le vent hagard, soufflant dans son clairon,
  Dénoue au-dessus d'eux sa longue et folle tresse
  Et que peut-être ils sont à cette heure en détresse,
  Et qu'on ne sait jamais au juste ce qu'ils font,
  Et que pour tenir tête à cette mer sans fond,
  A tous ces gouffres d'ombre où ne luit nulle étoile,
  Ils n'ont qu'un bout de planche avec un bout de toile!
  Souci lugubre! on court à travers les galets.
  Le flot monte, on lui parle, on crie: Oh! rends-nous-les!
  Mais, hélas! que veut-on que dise à la pensée
  Toujours sombre la mer toujours bouleversée?

  Jeannie est bien plus triste encor. Son homme est seul!
  Seul dans cette âpre nuit! seul sous ce noir linceul!
  Pas d'aide. Ses enfants sont trop petits.--O mère!
  Tu dis: S'ils étaient grands! leur père est seul!--Chimère!
  Plus tard, quand ils seront près du père et partis,
  Tu diras en pleurant: Oh! s'ils étaient petits!


V

  Elle prend sa lanterne et sa cape.--C'est l'heure
  D'aller voir s'il revient, si la mer est meilleure,
  S'il fait jour, si la flamme est au mât du signal.
  Allons!--Et la voilà qui part. L'air matinal
  Ne souffle pas encor. Rien. Pas de ligne blanche
  Dans l'espace où le flot des ténèbres s'épanche.
  Il pleut. Rien n'est plus noir que la pluie au matin;
  On dirait que le jour tremble et doute, incertain,
  Et qu'ainsi que l'enfant l'aube pleure de naître.
  Elle va. L'on ne voit luire aucune fenêtre.

  Tout à coup à ses yeux qui cherchent le chemin,
  Avec je ne sais quoi de lugubre et d'humain,
  Une sombre masure apparaît décrépite;
  Ni lumière, ni feu; la porte au vent palpite;
  Sur les murs vermoulus branle un toit hasardeux,
  La bise sur ce toit tord des chaumes hideux,
  jaunes, sales, pareils aux grosses eaux d'un fleuve.

  --Tiens! je ne pensais plus à cette pauvre veuve,
  Dit-elle; mon mari, l'autre jour, la trouva
  Malade et seule; il faut voir comment elle va.

  Elle frappe à la porte, elle écoute; personne
  Ne répond. Et Jeannie au vent de mer frissonne.
  --Malade! Et ses enfants! comme c'est mal nourri!
  Elle n'en a que deux, mais elle est sans mari.--
  Puis, elle frappe encore. Hé! voisine! Elle appelle,
  Et la maison se tait toujours.--Ah! Dieu! dit-elle,
  Comme elle dort, qu'il faut l'appeler si longtemps!--
  La porte, cette fois, comme si, par instants,
  Les objets étaient pris d'une pitié suprême,
  Morne, tourna dans l'ombre et s'ouvrit d'elle-même.


VI

  Elle entra. Sa lanterne éclaira le dedans
  Du noir logis muet au bord des flots grondants.
  L'eau tombait du plafond comme des trous d'un crible.

  Au fond était couchée une forme terrible;
  Une femme immobile et renversée, ayant
  Les pieds nus, le regard obscur, l'air effrayant;
  Un cadavre;--autrefois, mère joyeuse et forte;--
  Le spectre échevelé de la misère morte;
  Ce qui reste du pauvre après un long combat.
  Elle laissait, parmi la paille du grabat,
  Son bras livide et froid et sa main déjà verte
  Pendre, et l'horreur sortait de cette bouche ouverte
  D'où l'âme en s'enfuyant, sinistre, avait jeté
  Ce grand cri de la mort qu'entend l'éternité!

  Près du lit où gisait la mère de famille,
  Deux tout petits enfants, le garçon et la fille,
  Dans le même berceau souriaient endormis.

  La mère, se sentant mourir, leur avait mis
  Sa mante sur les pieds et sur le corps sa robe,
  Afin que, dans cette ombre où la mort nous dérobe,
  Ils ne sentissent plus la tiédeur qui décroît,
  Et pour qu'ils eussent chaud pendant qu'elle aurait froid.


VII

  Comme ils dorment tous deux dans le berceau qui tremble!
  Leur haleine est paisible et leur front calme. Il semble
  Que rien n'éveillerait ces orphelins dormant,
  Pas même le clairon du dernier jugement;
  Car, étant innocents, ils n'ont pas peur du juge.

  Et la pluie au dehors gronde comme un déluge.
  Du vieux toit crevassé, d'où la rafale sort,
  Une goutte parfois tombe sur ce front mort,
  Glisse sur cette joue et devient une larme.
  La vague sonne ainsi qu'une cloche d'alarme.
  La morte écoute l'ombre avec stupidité.
  Car le corps, quand l'esprit radieux l'a quitté,
  A l'air de chercher l'âme et de rappeler l'ange;
  Il semble qu'on entend ce dialogue étrange
  Entre la bouche pâle et l'oeil triste et hagard:
  --Qu'as-tu fait de ton souffle?--Et toi, de ton regard?

  Hélas! aimez, vivez, cueillez les primevères,
  Dansez, riez, brûlez vos coeurs, videz vos verres.
  Comme au sombre océan arrive tout ruisseau,
  Le sort donne pour but au festin, au berceau,
  Aux mères adorant l'enfance épanouie,
  Aux baisers de la chair dont l'âme est éblouie,
  Aux chansons, au sourire, à l'amour frais et beau.
  Le refroidissement lugubre du tombeau!


VIII

  Qu'est-ce donc que Jeannie a fait chez cette morte?
  Sous sa cape aux longs plis qu'est-ce donc qu'elle emporte?
  Qu'est-ce donc que Jeannie emporte en s'en allant?
  Pourquoi son coeur bat-il? Pourquoi son pas tremblant
  Se hâte-t-il ainsi? D'où vient qu'en la ruelle
  Elle court, sans oser regarder derrière elle?
  Qu'est-ce donc qu'elle cache avec un air troublé
  Dans l'ombre, sur son lit? Qu'a-t-elle donc volé?


IX

  Quand elle fut rentrée au logis, la falaise
  Blanchissait; près du lit elle prit une chaise
  Et s'assit toute pâle; on eût dit qu'elle avait
  Un remords, et son front tomba sur le chevet,
  Et, par instants, à mots entrecoupés, sa bouche
  Parlait pendant qu'au loin grondait la mer farouche.

  --Mon pauvre homme! ah! mon Dieu! que va-t-il dire? Il a
  Déjà tant de souci! Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait là?
  Cinq enfants sur les bras! ce père qui travaille!
  Il n'avait pas assez de peine; il faut que j'aille
  Lui donner celle-là de plus.--C'est lui?--Non. Rien.
  --J'ai mal fait.--S'il me bat, je dirai: Tu fais bien.
  --Est-ce lui?--Non.--Tant mieux.--La porte bouge comme
  Si l'on entrait.--Mais non.--Voilà-t-il pas, pauvre homme,
  Que j'ai peur de le voir rentrer, moi, maintenant!--
  Puis elle demeura pensive et frissonnant,
  S'enfonçant par degrés dans son angoisse intime,
  Perdue en son souci comme dans un abîme,
  N'entendant même plus les bruits extérieurs,
  Les cormorans qui vont comme de noirs crieurs,
  Et l'onde et la marée et le vent en colère.

  La porte tout à coup s'ouvrit, bruyante et claire,
  Et fit dans la cabane entrer un rayon blanc;
  Et le pêcheur, traînant son filet ruisselant,
  Joyeux, parut au seuil, et dit: C'est la marine!


X

  --C'est toi! cria Jeannie, et contre sa poitrine
  Elle prit son mari comme on prend un amant,
  Et lui baisa sa veste avec emportement,
  Tandis que lé marin disait:--Me voici, femme!
  Et montrait sur son front qu'éclairait l'âtre en flamme
  Son coeur bon et content que Jeannie éclairait.
  --Je suis volé, dit-il; la mer, c'est la forêt.
  --Quel temps a-t-il fait?--Dur.--Et la pêche?--Mauvaise,
  Mais, vois-tu, je t'embrasse et me voilà bien aise.
  Je n'ai rien pris du tout. J'ai troué mon filet.
  Le diable était caché dans le vent qui soufflait.
  Quelle nuit! Un moment, dans tout ce tintamarre,
  J'ai cru que le bateau se couchait, et l'amarre
  A cassé. Qu'as-tu fait, toi, pendant ce temps-là?--
  Jeannie eut un frisson dans l'ombre et se troubla.
  --Moi?  dit-elle. Ah!  mon  Dieu!  rien,  comme  à l'ordinaire,
  J'ai cousu. J'écoutais la mer comme un tonnerre,
  J'avais peur.--Oui, l'hiver est dur, mais c'est égal.--
  Alors, tremblante ainsi que ceux qui font le mal,
  Elle dit:--A propos, notre voisine est morte.
  C'est hier qu'elle a dû mourir, enfin, n'importe,
  Dans la soirée, après que vous fûtes partis.
  Elle laisse ses deux enfants, qui sont petits.
  L'un s'appelle Guillaume et l'autre Madeleine;
  L'un qui ne marche pas, l'autre qui parle à peine.
  La pauvre bonne femme était dans le besoin.

  L'homme prit un air grave, et, jetant dans un coin
  Son bonnet de forçat mouillé par la tempête:
  --Diable! diable! dit-il en se grattant la tête,
  Nous avions cinq enfants, cela va faire sept.
  Déjà, dans la saison mauvaise, on se passait
  De souper quelquefois. Comment allons-nous faire?
  Bah! tant pis! ce n'est pas ma faute. C'est l'affaire
  Du bon Dieu. Ce sont là des accidents profonds.
  Pourquoi donc a-t-il pris leur mère à ces chiffons?
  C'est gros comme le poing. Ces choses-là sont rudes.
  Il faut pour les comprendre avoir fait ses études.
  Si petits!  on ne peut leur dire: Travaillez.
  Femme, va les chercher. S'ils se sont réveillés,
  Ils doivent avoir peur tout seuls avec la morte.
  C'est la mère, vois-tu, qui frappe à notre porte;
  Ouvrons aux deux enfants. Nous les mêlerons tous,
  Cela nous grimpera le soir sur les genoux.
  Ils vivront, ils seront frère et soeur des cinq autres.
  Quand il verra qu'il faut nourrir avec les nôtres
  Cette petite fille et ce petit garçon,
  Le bon Dieu nous fera prendre plus de poisson.
  Moi, je boirai de l'eau, je ferai double tâche,
  C'est dit. Va les chercher. Mais qu'as-tu?  Ça te fâche?
  D'ordinaire, tu cours plus vite que cela.

  --Tiens, dit-elle en ouvrant les rideaux, les voilà!


I

PLEINE MER

  L'abîme; on ne sait quoi de terrible qui gronde;
  Le vent; l'obscurité vaste comme le monde;
  Partout les flots; partout où l'oeil peut s'enfoncer,
  La rafale qu'on voit aller, venir, passer;
  L'onde, linceul; le ciel, ouverture de tombe;
  Les ténèbres sans l'arche et l'eau sans la colombe,
  Les nuages ayant l'aspect d'une forêt.
  Un esprit qui viendrait planer là ne pourrait
  Dire, entre l'eau sans fond et l'espace sans borne,
  Lequel est le plus sombre, et si cette horreur morne,
  Faite de cécité, de stupeur et de bruit,
  Vient de l'immense mer ou de l'immense nuit.

  L'oeil distingue, au milieu du gouffre où l'air sanglote,
  Quelque chose d'informe et de hideux qui flotte,
  Un grand cachalot mort à carcasse de fer,
  On ne sait quel cadavre à vau-l'eau dans la mer,
  Oeuf de titan dont l'homme aurait fait un navire.
  Cela vogue, cela nage, cela chavire;
  Cela fut un vaisseau; l'écume aux blancs amas
  Cache et montre à grand bruit les tronçons de sept mâts.
  Le colosse, échoué sur le ventre, fuit, plonge,
  S'engloutit, reparaît, se meut comme le songe,
  Chaos d'agrès rompus, de poutres, de haubans;
  Le grand mât vaincu semble un spectre aux bras tombants.
  L'onde passe à travers ce débris; l'eau s'engage
  Et déferle en hurlant le long du bastingage,
  Et tourmente des bouts de corde à des crampons
  Dans le ruissellement formidable des ponts;
  La houle éperdument furieuse saccage
  Aux deux flancs du vaisseau les cintres d'une cage
  Où jadis une roue effrayante a tourné.
  Personne; le néant, froid, muet, étonné;
  D'affreux canons rouillés tendant leurs cous funestes;
  L'entre-pont a des trous où se dressent les restes
  De cinq tubes pareils à des clairons géants,
  Pleins jadis d'une foudre, et qui, tordus, béants,
  Ployés, éteints, n'ont plus, sur l'eau qui les balance,
  Qu'un noir vomissement de nuit et de silence;
  Le flux et le reflux, comme avec un rabot,
  Dénude à chaque coup l'étrave et l'étambot,
  Et dans la lame on voit se débattre l'échine
  D'une mystérieuse et difforme machine.
  Cette masse sous l'eau rôde, fantôme obscur.
  Des putréfactions fermentent, à coup sûr,
  Dans ce vaisseau perdu sous les vagues sans nombre.
  Dessus, des tourbillons d'oiseaux de mer; dans l'ombre,
  Dessous, des millions de poissons carnassiers.
  Tout à l'entour, les flots, ces liquides aciers,
  Mêlent leurs tournoiements monstrueux et livides.
  Des espaces déserts sous des espaces vides.
  O triste mer! sépulcre où tout semble vivant!
  Ces deux athlètes faits de furie et de vent,
  Le tangage qui brave et le roulis qui fume,
  Sans trêve, à chaque instant arrachent quelque éclat
  De la quille ou du port dans leur noir pugilat.
  Par moments, au zénith un nuage se troue,
  Un peu de jour lugubre en tombe, et, sur la proue,
  Une lueur, qui tremble au souffle de l'autan,
  Blême, éclaire à demi ce mot: LÉVIATHAN.
  Puis l'apparition se perd dans l'eau profonde;
  Tout fuit.

           Léviathan; c'est là tout le vieux monde,
  Apre et démesuré dans sa fauve laideur;
  Léviathan, c'est là tout le passé: grandeur,
  Horreur.

           Le dernier siècle a vu sur la Tamise
  Croître un monstre à qui l'eau sans bornes fut promise,
  Et qui longtemps, Babel des mers, eut Londre entier
  Levant les yeux dans l'ombre au pied de son chantier.
  Effroyable, à sept mâts mêlant cinq cheminées
  Qui hennissaient au choc des vagues effrénées,
  Emportant, dans le bruit des aquilons sifflants,
  Dix mille hommes, fourmis éparses dans ses flancs,
  Ce titan se rua, joyeux, dans la tempête;
  Du dôme de Saint-Paul son mât passait le faîte;
  Le sombre esprit humain, debout sur son tillac,
  Stupéfiait la mer qui n'était plus qu'un lac;
  Le vieillard Océan, qu'effarouche la sonde,
  Inquiet, à travers le verre de son onde,
  Regardait le vaisseau de l'homme grossissant;
  Ce vaisseau fut sur l'onde un terrible passant;
  Les vagues frémissaient de l'avoir sur leurs croupes;
  Ses sabords mugissaient; en guise de chaloupes,
  Deux navires pendaient à ses portemanteaux;
  Son armure était faite avec tous les métaux;
  Un prodigieux câble ourlait sa grande voile;
  Quand il marchait, fumant, grondant, couvert de toile,
  Il jetait un tel râle à l'air épouvanté
  Que toute l'eau tremblait, et que l'immensité
  Comptait parmi ses bruits ce grand frisson sonore.
  La nuit, il passait rouge ainsi qu'un météore;
  Sa voilure, où l'oreille entendait le débat
  Des souffles, subissant ce gréement comme un bât,
  Ses hunes, ses grelins, ses palans, ses amures,
  Étaient une prison de vents et de murmures;
  Son ancre avait le poids d'une tour; ses parois
  Voulaient les flots, trouvant tous les ports trop étroits;
  Son ombre humiliait au loin toutes les proues;
  Un télégraphe était son porte-voix; ses roues
  Forgeaient la sombre mer comme deux grands marteaux;
  Les flots se le passaient comme des piédestaux
  Où, calme, ondulerait un triomphal colosse:
  L'abîme s'abrégeait sous sa lourdeur véloce;
  Pas de lointain pays qui pour lui ne fût près;
  Madère apercevait ses mâts, trois jours après
  L'Hékla l'entrevoyait dans la lueur polaire.
  La bataille montait sur lui dans sa colère.
  La guerre était sacrée et sainte en ce temps-là;
  Rien n'égalait Nemrod si ce n'est Attila;
  Et les hommes, depuis les premiers jours du monde,
  Sentant peser sur eux la misère inféconde,
  Les pestes, les fléaux lugubres et railleurs,
  Cherchant quelque moyen d'amoindrir leurs douleurs,
  Pour établir entre eux de justes équilibres,
  Pour être plus heureux, meilleurs, plus grands, plus libres,
  Plus dignes du ciel pur qui les daigne éclairer,
  Avaient imaginé de s'entre-dévorer.
  Ce sinistre vaisseau les aidait dans leur oeuvre.
  Lourd comme le dragon, prompt comme la couleuvre,
  Il couvrait l'océan de ses ailes de feu;
  La terre s'effrayait quand sur l'horizon bleu
  Rampait l'allongement hideux de sa fumée,
  Car c'était une ville et c'était une armée;
  Ses pavois fourmillaient de mortiers et d'affûts,
  Et d'un hérissement de bataillons confus;
  Ses grappins menaçaient; et, pour les abordages,
  On voyait sur ses ponts des rouleaux de cordages
  Monstrueux, qui semblaient des boas endormis;
  Invincible, en ces temps de frères ennemis,
  Seul, de toute une flotte il affrontait l'émeute,
  Ainsi qu'un éléphant au milieu d'une meute;
  La bordée à ses pieds fumait comme un encens,
  Ses flancs engloutissaient les boulets impuissants,
  Il allait broyant tout dans l'obscure mêlée,
  Et, quand, épouvantable, il lâchait sa volée,
  On voyait flamboyer son colossal beaupré,
  Par deux mille canons brusquement empourpré.
  Il méprisait l'autan, le flux, l'éclair, la brume.
  A son avant tournait, dans un chaos d'écume,
  Une espèce de vrille à trouer l'infini.
  Le Maelström s'apaisait sous sa quille aplani.
  Sa vie intérieure était un incendie,
  Flamme au gré du pilote apaisée ou grandie;
  Dans l'antre d'où sortait son vaste mouvement,
  Au fond d'une fournaise on voyait vaguement
  Des êtres ténébreux marcher dans des nuées
  D'étincelles, parmi les braises remuées;
  Et pour âme il avait dans sa cale un enfer.
  Il voguait, roi du gouffre, et ses vergues de fer
  Ressemblaient, sous le ciel redoutable et sublime,
  A des spectres posés en travers de l'abîme;
  Ainsi qu'on voit l'Etna l'on voyait le steamer;
  Il était la montagne errante de la mer.
  Mais les heures, les jours, les mois, les ans, ces ondes,
  Ont passé; l'océan, vaste entre les deux mondes,
  A rugi, de brouillard et d'orage obscurci;
  La mer a ses écueils cachés, le temps aussi;
  Et maintenant, parmi les profondeurs farouches,
  Sous les vautours, qui sont de l'abîme les mouches,
  Sous le nuage, au gré des souffles, dans l'oubli
  De l'infini, dont l'ombre affreuse est le repli,
  Sans que jamais le vent autour d'elle s'endorme,
  Au milieu des flots noirs roule l'épave énorme!

  L'ancien monde, l'ensemble étrange et surprenant
  De faits sociaux, morts et pourris maintenant,
  D'où sortit ce navire aujourd'hui sous l'écume,
  L'ancien monde aussi, lui, plongé dans l'amertume,
  Avait tous les fléaux pour vents et pour typhons.
  Construction d'airain aux étages profonds,
  Sur qui le mal, flot vil, crachait sa bave infâme,
  Plein de fumée, et mû par une hydre de flamme,
  La Haine, il ressemblait à ce sombre vaisseau.

  Le mal l'avait marqué de son funèbre sceau.

  Ce monde, enveloppé d'une brume éternelle,
  Était fatal: l'Espoir avait plié son aile;
  Pas d'unité, divorce et joug; diversité
  De langue, de raison, de code, de cité;
  Nul lien; nul faisceau; le progrès solitaire,
  Comme un serpent coupé, se tordait sur la terre,
  Sans pouvoir réunir les tronçons de l'effort;
  L'esclavage, parquant les peuples pour la mort,
  Les enfermait au fond d'un cirque de frontières
  Où les gardaient la Guerre et la Nuit, bestiaires;
  L'Adam slave luttait contre l'Adam germain;
  Un genre humain en France; un autre genre humain
  En Amérique, un autre à Londre, un autre à Rome;
  L'homme au delà d'un pont ne connaissait plus l'homme;
  Les vivants, d'ignorance et de vices chargés,
  Se traînaient; en travers de tout, les préjugés,
  Les superstitions étaient d'âpres enceintes
  Terribles d'autant plus qu'elles étaient plus saintes;
  Quel créneau soupçonneux et noir qu'un alcoran!
  Un texte avait le glaive au poing comme un tyran;
  La loi d'un peuple était chez l'autre peuple un crime;
  Lire était un fossé, croire était un abîme;
  Les rois étaient des tours; les dieux étaient des murs;
  Nul moyen de franchir tant d'obstacles obscurs;
  Sitôt qu'on voulait croître, on rencontrait la barre
  D'une mode sauvage ou d'un dogme barbare;
  Et, quant à l'avenir, défense d'aller là.


  Le vent de l'infini sur ce monde souffla.
  Il a sombré. Du fond des cieux inaccessibles,
  Les vivants de l'éther, les êtres invisibles
  Confusément épars sous l'obscur firmament
  A cette heure, pensifs, regardent fixement
  Sa disparition dans la nuit redoutable.
  Qu'est-ce que le simoun a fait du grain de sable?
  Cela fut. C'est passé. Cela n'est plus ici.


  Ce monde est mort. Mais quoi! l'homme est-il mort aussi?
  Cette forme de lui disparaissant, l'a-t-elle
  Lui-même remporté dans l'énigme éternelle?
  L'océan est désert. Pas une voile au loin.
  Ce n'est plus que du flot que le flot est témoin.
  Pas un esquif vivant sur l'onde où la mouette
  Voit du Léviathan rôder la silhouette.
  Est-ce que l'homme, ainsi qu'un feuillage jauni,
  S'en est allé dans l'ombre? Est-ce que c'est fini?
  Seul, le flux et reflux va, vient, passe et repasse.
  Et l'oeil, pour retrouver l'homme absent de l'espace,
  Regarde en vain là-bas. Rien.

                               Regardez là-haut.


II

PLEIN CIEL

  Loin dans les profondeurs, hors des nuits, hors du flot,
  Dans un écartement de nuages, qui laisse
  Voir au-dessus des mers la céleste allégresse,
  Un point vague et confus apparaît; dans le vent,
  Dans l'espace, ce point se meut; il est vivant,
  Il va, descend, remonte; il fait ce qu'il veut faire;
  Il approche, il prend forme, il vient; c'est une sphère,
  C'est un inexprimable et surprenant vaisseau,
  Globe comme le monde, et comme l'aigle oiseau;
  C'est un navire en marche. Où? Dans l'éther sublime!

  Rêve! on croit voir planer un morceau d'une cime;
  Le haut d'une montagne a, sous l'orbe étoilé,
  Pris des ailes et s'est tout à coup envolé?
  Quelque heure immense étant dans les destins sonnée,
  La nuit errante s'est en vaisseau façonnée?
  La Fable apparaît-elle à nos yeux décevants?
  L'antique Éole a-t-il jeté son outre aux vents?
  De sorte qu'en ce gouffre où les orages naissent,
  Les vents, subitement domptés, la reconnaissent?
  Est-ce l'aimant qui s'est fait aider par l'éclair
  Pour bâtir un esquif céleste avec de l'air?
  Du haut des clairs azurs vient-il une visite?
  Est-ce un transfiguré qui part et ressuscite,
  Qui monte, délivré de la terre, emporté
  Sur un char volant fait d'extase et de clarté,
  Et se rapproche un peu par instants pour qu'on voie,
  Du fond du monde noir, la fuite de sa joie?

  Ce n'est pas un morceau d'une cime; ce n'est
  Ni l'outre où tout le vent de la Fable tenait,
  Ni le jeu de l'éclair; ce n'est pas un fantôme
  Venu des profondeurs aurorales du dôme;
  Ni le rayonnement d'un ange qui s'en va,
  Hors de quelque tombeau béant, vers Jéhovah;
  Ni rien de ce qu'en songe ou dans la fièvre on nomme.
  Qu'est-ce que ce navire impossible? C'est l'homme.

  C'est la grande révolte obéissante à Dieu!
  La sainte fausse clef du fatal gouffre bleu!
  C'est Isis qui déchire éperdument son voile!
  C'est du métal, du bois, du chanvre et de la toile,
  C'est de la pesanteur délivrée, et volant;
  C'est la force alliée à l'homme étincelant,
  Fière, arrachant l'argile à sa chaîne éternelle;
  C'est la matière, heureuse, altière, ayant en elle
  De l'ouragan humain, et planant à travers
  L'immense étonnement des cieux enfin ouverts!

  Audace humaine!  effort du captif! sainte rage!
  Effraction enfin plus forte que la cage!
  Que faut-il à cet être, atome au large front,
  Pour vaincre ce qui n'a ni fin, ni bord, ni fond,
  Pour dompter le vent, trombe, et l'écume, avalanche?
  Dans le ciel une toile et sur mer une planche.


  Jadis des quatre vents la fureur triomphait;
  De ces quatre chevaux échappés l'homme a fait
      L'attelage de son quadrige;
  Génie, il les tient tous dans sa main, fier cocher
  Du char aérien que l'éther voit marcher;
      Miracle, il gouverne un prodige.

  Char merveilleux! son nom est Délivrance. Il court
  Près de lui le ramier est lent, le flocon lourd;
      Le daim, l'épervier, la panthère
  Sont encor là, qu'au loin son ombre a déjà fui;
  Et la locomotive est reptile, et, sous lui,
      L'hydre de flamme est ver de terre.

  Une musique, un chant, sort de son tourbillon.
  Ses cordages vibrants et remplis d'aquilon
      Semblent, dans le vide où tout sombre,
  Une lyre à travers laquelle par moment
  Passe quelque âme en fuite au fond du firmament
      Et mêlée aux souffles de l'ombre.

  Car l'air, c'est l'hymne épars; l'air, parmi les récifs
  Des nuages roulant en groupes convulsifs,
      Jette mille voix étouffées;
  Les fluides, l'azur, l'effluve, l'élément,
  Sont toute une harmonie où flottent vaguement
      On ne sait quels sombres Orphées.

  Superbe, il plane avec un hymne en ses agrès;
  Et l'on croit voir passer la strophe du progrès.
      Il est la nef, il est le phare!
  L'homme enfin prend son sceptre et jette son bâton.
  Et l'on voit s'envoler le calcul de Newton
      Monté sur l'ode de Pindare.

  Le char haletant plonge et s'enfonce dans l'air,
  Dans l'éblouissement impénétrable et clair,
      Dans l'éther sans tache et sans ride;
  Il se perd sous le bleu des cieux démesurés;
  Les esprits de l'azur contemplent effarés
      Cet engloutissement splendide.

  Il passe, il n'est plus là; qu'est-il donc devenu?
  Il est dans l'invisible, il est dans l'inconnu;
      Il baigne l'homme dans le songe,
  Dans le fait, dans le vrai profond, dans la clarté,
  Dans l'océan d'en haut plein d'une vérité
      Dont le prêtre a fait un mensonge.

  Le jour se lève, il va; le jour s'évanouit,
  Il va; fait pour le jour, il accepte la nuit.
      Voici l'heure des feux sans nombre;
  L'heure où, vu du nadir, ce globe semble, ayant
  Son large cône obscur sous lui se déployant,
      Une énorme comète d'ombre.

  La brume redoutable emplit au loin les airs.
  Ainsi qu'au crépuscule on voit, le long des mers,
      Le pêcheur, vague comme un rêve,
  Traînant, dernier effort d'un long jour de sueurs,
  Sa nasse où les poissons font de pâles lueurs,
      Aller et venir sur la grève.

  La Nuit tire du fond des gouffres inconnus
  Son filet où luit Mars, où rayonne Vénus,
      Et, pendant que les heures sonnent,
  Ce filet grandit, monte, emplit le ciel des soirs,
  Et dans ses mailles d'ombre et dans ses réseaux noirs
      Les constellations frissonnent.

  L'aéroscaphe suit son chemin; il n'a peur
  Ni des pièges du soir, ni de l'âcre vapeur,
      Ni du ciel morne où rien ne bouge,
  Où les éclairs, luttant au fond de l'ombre entre eux,
  Ouvrent subitement dans le nuage affreux
      Des cavernes de cuivre rouge.

  Il invente une route obscure dans les nuits;
  Le silence hideux de ces lieux inouïs
      N'arrête point ce globe en marche;
  Il passe, portant l'homme et l'univers en lui;
  Paix! gloire! et, comme l'eau jadis, l'air aujourd'hui
      Au-dessus de ses flots voit l'arche.

  Le saint navire court par le vent emporté
  Avec la certitude et la rapidité
      Du javelot cherchant la cible;
  Rien n'en tombe, et pourtant il chemine en semant;
  Sa rondeur, qu'on distingue en haut confusément,
      Semble un ventre d'oiseau terrible.

  Il vogue; les brouillards sous lui flottent dissous;
  Ses pilotes penchés regardent, au-dessous
      Des nuages où l'ancre traîne,
  Si, dans l'ombre, où la terre avec l'air se confond,
  Le sommet du mont Blanc ou quelque autre bas-fond
      Ne vient pas heurter sa carène.

  La vie est sur le pont du navire éclatant.
  Le rayon l'envoya, la lumière l'attend.
  L'homme y fourmille, l'homme invincible y flamboie.
  Point d'armes; un fier bruit de puissance et de joie;
  Le cri vertigineux de l'exploration!
  Il court, ombre, clarté, chimère, vision!
  Regardez-le pendant qu'il passe, il va si vite!
  Comme autour d'un soleil un système gravite,
  Une sphère de cuivre énorme fait marcher
  Quatre globes où pend un immense plancher;
  Elle respire et fuit dans les vents qui la bercent;
  Un large et blanc hunier horizontal, que percent
  Des trappes, se fermant, s'ouvrant au gré du frein,
  Fait un grand diaphragme à ce poumon d'airain;
  Il s'impose à la nue ainsi qu'à l'onde un liège;
  La toile d'araignée humaine, un vaste piège
  De cordes et de noeuds, un enchevêtrement
  De soupapes que meut un câble où court l'aimant,
  Une embûche de treuils, de cabestans, de moufles,
  Prend au passage et fait travailler tous les souffles;
  L'esquif plane, encombré d'hommes et de ballots,
  Parmi les arcs-en-ciel, les azurs, les halos,
  Et sa course, écheveau qui sans fin se dévide,
  A pour point d'appui l'air et pour moteur le vide;
  Sous le plancher s'étage un chaos régulier
  De ponts flottants que lie un tremblant escalier;
  Ce navire est un Louvre errant avec son faste;
  Un fil le porte; il fuit, léger, fier, et si vaste,
  Si colossal, au vent du grand abîme clair,
  Que le Léviathan, rampant dans l'âpre mer,
  A l'air de sa chaloupe aux ténèbres tombée,
  Et semble, sous le vol d'un aigle, un scarabée
  Se tordant dans le flot qui l'emporte, tandis
  Que l'immense oiseau plane au fond d'un paradis.

  Si l'on pouvait rouvrir les yeux que le ver ronge,
  Oh! ce vaisseau, construit par le chiffre et le songe,
  Éblouirait Shakspeare et ravirait Euler!
  Il voyage, Délos gigantesque de l'air,
  Et rien ne le repousse et rien ne le refuse;
  Et l'on entend parler sa grande voix confuse.

  Par moments la tempête accourt, le ciel pâlit,
  L'autan, bouleversant les flots de l'air, emplit
  L'espace d'une écume affreuse de nuages;
  Mais qu'importe à l'esquif de la mer sans rivages?
  Seulement, sur son aile il se dresse en marchant;
  Il devient formidable à l'abîme méchant,
  Et dompte en frémissant la trombe qui se creuse.
  On le dirait conduit dans l'horreur ténébreuse
  Par l'âme des Leibniz, des Fultons, des Képlers;
  Et l'on croit voir, parmi le chaos plein d'éclairs,
  De détonations, d'ombre et de jets de soufre,
  Le sombre emportement d'un monde dans un gouffre.

  Qu'importe le moment? qu'importe la saison?
  La brume peut cacher dans le blême horizon
      Les Saturnes et les Mercures;
  La bise, conduisant la pluie aux crins épars,
  Dans les nuages lourds grondant de toutes parts
      Peut tordre des hydres obscures;

  Qu'importe? il va. Tout souffle est bon; simoun, mistral!
  La terre a disparu dans le puits sidéral,
      Il entre au mystère nocturne,
  Au-dessus de la grêle et de l'ouragan fou,
  Laissant le globe en bas dans l'ombre, on ne sait où,
      Sous le renversement de l'urne.

  Intrépide, il bondit sur les ondes du vent;
  Il se rue, aile ouverte et a proue en avant,
      Il monte, il monte, il monte encore,
  Au delà de la zone où tout s'évanouit,
  Comme s'il s'en allait dans la profonde nuit
      A la poursuite de l'aurore!

  Calme, il monte où jamais nuage n'est monté;
  Il plane à la hauteur de la sérénité,
      Devant la vision des sphères;
  Elles sont là, faisant le mystère éclatant,
  Chacune feu d'un gouffre, et toutes constatant
      Les énigmes par les lumières.

  Andromède étincelle, Orion resplendit;
  L'essaim prodigieux des Pléiades grandit;
      Sirius ouvre son cratère;
  Arcturus, oiseau d'or, scintille dans son nid;
  Le Scorpion hideux fait cabrer au zénith
      Le poitrail bleu du Sagittaire.

  L'aéroscaphe voit, comme en face de lui,
  Là-haut, Aldebaran par Céphée ébloui,
      Persée, escarboucle des cimes,
  Le chariot polaire aux flamboyants essieux,
  Et, plus loin, la lueur lactée, ô sombres cieux,
      La fourmilière des abîmes!

  Vers l'apparition terrible des soleils,
  Il monte; dans l'horreur des espaces vermeils,
      Il s'oriente, ouvrant ses voiles;
  On croirait, dans l'éther où de loin on entend,
  Que ce vaisseau puissant et superbe, en chantant,
      Part pour une de ces étoiles;

  Tant cette nef, rompant tous les terrestres noeuds,
  Volante, et franchissant le ciel vertigineux,
      Rêve des blêmes Zoroastres,
  Comme effrénée au souffle insensé de la nuit,
  Se jette, plonge, enfonce et tombe et roule et fuit
      Dans le précipice des astres!

  Où donc s'arrêtera l'homme séditieux?
  L'espace voit, d'un oeil par moment soucieux,
  L'empreinte du talon de l'homme dans les nues;
  Il tient l'extrémité des choses inconnues;
  Il épouse l'abîme à son argile uni;
  Le voilà maintenant marcheur de l'infini.
  Où s'arrêtera-t-il, le puissant réfractaire?
  Jusqu'à quelle distance ira-t-il de la terre?
  Jusqu'à quelle distance ira-t-il du destin?
  L'âpre Fatalité se perd dans le lointain;
  Toute l'antique histoire affreuse et déformée
  Sur l'horizon nouveau fuit comme une fumée.
  Les temps sont venus. L'homme a pris possession
  De l'air, comme du flot le grèbe et l'alcyon.
  Devant nos rêves fiers, devant nos utopies
  Ayant des yeux croyants et des ailes impies,
  Devant tous nos efforts pensifs et haletants,
  L'obscurité sans fond fermait ses deux battants;
  Le vrai champ enfin s'offre aux puissantes algèbres;
  L'homme vainqueur, tirant le verrou des ténèbres,
  Dédaigne l'océan, le vieil infini mort.
  La porte noire cède et s'entre-bâille. Il sort!

  O profondeurs! faut-il encor l'appeler l'homme?

  L'homme est d'abord monté sur la bête de somme;
  Puis sur le chariot que portent des essieux;
  Puis sur la frêle barque au mât ambitieux;
  Puis quand il a fallu vaincre l'écueil, la lame,
  L'onde et l'ouragan, l'homme est monté sur la flamme;
  A présent l'immortel aspire à l'éternel;
  Il montait sur la mer, il monte sur le ciel.

  L'homme force le sphinx à lui tenir la lampe.
  Jeune, il jette le sac du vieil Adam, qui rampe,
  Et part, et risque aux cieux, qu'éclaire son flambeau,
  Un pas semblable à ceux qu'on fait dans le tombeau;
  Et peut-être voici qu'enfin la traversée
  Effrayante, d'un astre à l'autre, est commencée!

  Stupeur! se pourrait-il que l'homme s'élançât?
  O nuit! se pourrait-il que l'homme, ancien forçat,
      Que l'esprit humain, vieux reptile,
  Devînt ange et, brisant le carcan qui le mord,
  Fût soudain de plain-pied avec les cieux?  La mort
      Va donc devenir inutile!

  Oh! franchir l'éther! songe épouvantable et beau!
  Doubler le promontoire énorme du tombeau!
      Qui sait?--toute aile est magnanime,
  L'homme est ailé,--peut-être, ô merveilleux retour!
  Un Christophe Colomb de l'ombre, quelque jour,
      Un Gama du cap de l'abîme,

  Un Jason de l'azur, depuis longtemps parti,
  De la terre oublié, par le ciel englouti,
      Tout à coup sur l'humaine rive
  Reparaîtra, monté sur cet alérion,
  Et, montrant Sirius, Allioth, Orion,
      Tout pâle, dira: J'en arrive!

  Ciel! ainsi, comme on voit aux voûtes des celliers
  Les noirceurs qu'en rôdant tracent les chandeliers,
      On pourrait, sous les bleus pilastres,
  Deviner qu'un enfant de la terre a passé,
  A ce que le flambeau de l'homme aurait laissé
      De fumée au plafond des astres!

  Pas si loin! pas si haut! redescendons. Restons
  L'homme, restons Adam; mais non l'homme à tâtons,
  Mais non l'Adam tombé!  Tout autre rêve altère
  L'espèce d'idéal qui convient à la terre.
  Contentons-nous du mot: meilleur! écrit partout.

  Oui, l'aube s'est levée.

                          Oh! ce fut tout à coup
  Comme une éruption de folie et de joie,
  Quand, après six mille ans dans la fatale voie,
  Défaite brusquement par l'invisible main,
  La pesanteur, liée au pied du genre humain,
  Se brisa; cette chaîne était toutes les chaînes!
  Tout s'envola dans l'homme, et les fureurs, les haines,
  Les chimères, la force évanouie enfin,
  L'ignorance et l'erreur, la misère et la faim,
  Le droit divin des rois, les faux dieux juifs ou guèbres,
  Le mensonge, le dol, les brumes, les ténèbres,
  Tombèrent dans la poudre avec l'antique sort,
  Comme le vêtement du bagne dont on sort.

  Et c'est ainsi que l'ère annoncée est venue,
  Cette ère qu'à travers les temps, épaisse nue,
  Thalès apercevait au loin devant ses yeux;
  Et Platon, lorsque, ému, des sphères dans les cieux
  Il écoutait les chants et contemplait les danses.

  Les êtres inconnus et bons, les providences
  Présentes dans l'azur où l'oeil ne les voit pas,
  Les anges qui de l'homme observent tous les pas,
  Leur tâche sainte étant de diriger les âmes
  Et d'attiser, avec toutes les belles flammes,
  La conscience au fond des cerveaux ténébreux,
  Ces amis des vivants, toujours penchés sur eux,
  Ont cessé de frémir et d'être, en la tourmente
  Et dans les sombres nuits, la voix qui se lamente.
  Voici qu'on voit bleuir l'idéale Sion.
  Ils n'ont plus d'oeil fixé sur l'apparition
  Du vainqueur, du soldat, du fauve chasseur d'hommes.
  Les vagues flamboiements épars sur les Sodomes,
  Précurseurs du grand feu dévorant, les lueurs
  Que jette le sourcil tragique des tueurs,
  Les guerres, s'arrachant avec leur griffe immonde
  Les frontières, haillon difforme du vieux monde,
  Les battements de coeur des mères aux abois,
  L'embuscade ou le vol guettant au fond des bois,
  Le cri de la chouette et de la sentinelle,
  Les fléaux, ne sont plus leur alarme éternelle.
  Le deuil n'est plus mêlé dans tout ce qu'on entend;
  Leur oreille n'est plus tendue à chaque instant
  Vers le gémissement indigné de la tombe;
  La moisson rit aux champs où râlait l'hécatombe;
  L'azur ne les voit plus pleurer les nouveau-nés,
  Dans tous les innocents pressentir des damnés,
  Et la pitié n'est plus leur unique attitude;
  Ils re regardent plus la morne servitude
  Tresser sa maille obscure à l'osier des berceaux.
  L'homme aux fers, pénétré du frisson des roseaux,
  Est remplacé par l'homme attendri, fort et calme;
  La fonction du sceptre est faite par la palme;
  Voici qu'enfin, ô gloire! exaucés dans leur voeu,
  Ces êtres, dieux pour nous, créatures pour Dieu,
  Sont heureux, l'homme est bon, et sont fiers, l'homme est juste.
  Les esprits purs, essaim de l'empyrée auguste,
  Devant ce globe obscur qui devient lumineux,
  Ne sentent plus saigner l'amour qu'ils ont en eux;
  Une clarté paraît dans leur beau regard sombre;
  Et l'archange commence à sourire dans l'ombre.


  Où va-t-il, ce navire?  Il va, de jour vêtu,
  A l'avenir divin et pur, à la vertu,
      A la science qu'on voit luire,
  A la mort des fléaux, à l'oubli généreux,
  A l'abondance, au calme, au rire, à l'homme heureux;
      Il va, ce glorieux navire,

  Au droit, à la raison, à la fraternité,
  A la religieuse et sainte vérité
      Sans impostures et sans voiles,
  A l'amour, sur les coeurs serrant son doux lien,
  Au juste, au grand, au bon, au beau...--Vous voyez bien
      Qu'en effet il monte aux étoiles!

  Il porte l'homme à l'homme, et l'esprit à l'esprit.
  Il civilise, ô gloire! Il ruine, il flétrit
      Tout l'affreux passé qui s'effare;
  Il abolit la loi de fer, la loi de sang,
  Les glaives, les carcans, l'esclavage, en passant
      Dans les cieux comme une fanfare.

  Il ramène au vrai ceux que le faux repoussa;
  Il fait briller la foi dans l'oeil de Spinosa
      Et l'espoir sur le front de Hobbe;
  Il plane, rassurant, réchauffant, épanchant
  Sur ce qui fut lugubre et ce qui fut méchant
      Toute la clémence de l'aube.

  Les vieux champs de bataille étaient là dans la nuit;
  Il passe, et maintenant voilà le jour qui luit
      Sur ces grands charniers de l'histoire
  Où les siècles, penchant leur oeil triste et profond,
  Venaient regarder l'ombre effroyable que font
      Les deux ailes de la victoire.

  Derrière lui, César redevient homme; Éden
  S'élargit sur l'Érèbe, épanoui soudain;
      Les ronces de lys sont couvertes;
  Tout revient, tout renaît; ce que la mort courbait
  Refleurit dans la vie, et le bois du gibet
      Jette, effrayé, des branches vertes.

  Le nuage, l'aurore aux candides fraîcheurs,
  L'aile de la colombe, et toutes les blancheurs,
      Composent là-haut sa magie;
  Derrière lui, pendant qu'il fuit vers la clarté,
  Dans l'antique noirceur de la fatalité
      Des lueurs de l'enfer rougie,

  Dans ce brumeux chaos qui fut le monde ancien,
  Où l'allah turc s'accoude au sphinx égyptien,
      Dans la séculaire géhenne,
  Dans la Gomorrhe infâme où flambe un lac fumant,
  Dans la forêt du mal qu'éclairent vaguement
      Les deux yeux fixes de la Haine,

  Tombent, sèchent, ainsi que des feuillages morts,
  Et s'en vont la douleur, le péché, le remords,
      La perversité lamentable,
  Tout l'ancien joug, de rêve et de crime forgé,
  Nemrod, Aron, la guerre avec le préjugé,
      La boucherie avec l'étable!

  Tous les spoliateurs et tous les corrupteurs
  S'en vont; et les faux jours sur les fausses hauteurs;
      Et le taureau d'airain qui beugle,
  La hache, le billot, le bûcher dévorant,
  Et le docteur versant l'erreur à l'ignorant,
      Vil bâton qui trompait l'aveugle!

  Et tous ceux qui faisaient, au lieu de repentirs,
  Un rire au prince avec les larmes des martyrs,
      Et tous ces flatteurs des épées
  Qui louaient le sultan, le maître universel,
  Et, pour assaisonner l'hymne, prenaient du sel
      Dans le sac aux têtes coupées!

  Les pestes, les forfaits, les cimiers fulgurants,
  S'effacent, et la route où marchaient les tyrans,
      Bélial roi, Dagon ministre,
  Et l'épine, et la haie horrible du chemin
  Où l'homme du vieux monde et du vieux vice humain
      Entend bêler le bouc sinistre.

  On voit luire partout les esprits sidéraux;
  On voit la fin du monstre et la fin du héros,
      Et de l'athée et de l'augure,
  La fin du conquérant, la fin du paria;
  Et l'on voit lentement sortir Beccaria
      De Dracon qui se transfigure.

  On voit l'agneau sortir du dragon fabuleux,
  La vierge de l'opprobre, et Marie aux yeux bleus
      De la Vénus prostituée;
  Le blasphème devient le psaume ardent et pur,
  L'hymne prend, pour s'en faire autant d'ailes d'azur,
      Tous les haillons de la huée.

  Tout est sauvé!  La fleur, le printemps aromal,
  L'éclosion du bien, l'écroulement du mal,
      Fêtent dans sa course enchantée
  Ce beau globe éclaireur, ce grand char curieux,
  Qu'Empédocle, du fond des gouffres, suit des yeux,
      Et, du haut des monts, Prométhée!

  Le jour s'est fait dans l'antre où l'horreur s'accroupit.
  En expirant, l'antique univers décrépit,
      Larve à la prunelle ternie,
  Gisant, et regardant le ciel noir s'étoiler,
  A laissé cette sphère heureuse s'envoler
      Des lèvres de son agonie.

  Oh! ce navire fait le voyage sacré!
  C'est l'ascension bleue à son premier degré,
      Hors de l'antique et vil décombre,
  Hors de la pesanteur, c'est l'avenir fondé;
  C'est le destin de l'homme à la fin évadé,
      Qui lève l'ancre et sort de l'ombre!

  Ce navire là-haut conclut le grand hymen,
  Il mêle presque à Dieu l'âme du genre humain.
      Il voit l'insondable, il y touche;
  Il est le vaste élan du progrès vers le ciel;
  Il est l'entrée altière et sainte du réel
      Dans l'antique idéal farouche.

  Oh! chacun de ses pas conquiert l'illimité!
  Il est la joie; il est la paix; l'humanité
      A trouvé son organe immense;
  Il vogue, usurpateur sacré, vainqueur béni,
  Reculant chaque jour plus loin dans l'infini
      Le point sombre où l'homme commence.

  Il laboure l'abîme; il ouvre ces sillons
  Où croissaient l'ouragan, l'hiver, les tourbillons,
      Les sifflements et les huées;
  Grâce à lui, la concorde est la gerbe des cieux;
  Il va, fécondateur du ciel mystérieux,
      Charrue auguste des nuées.

  Il fait germer la vie humaine dans ces champs
  Où Dieu n'avait encor semé que des couchants
      Et moissonné que des aurores;
  Il entend, sous son vol qui fend les airs sereins,
  Croître et frémir partout les peuples souverains,
      Ces immenses épis sonores!

  Nef magique et suprême! elle a, rien qu'en marchant,
  Changé le cri terrestre en pur et joyeux chant,
      Rajeuni les races flétries,
  Établi l'ordre vrai, montré le chemin sûr,
  Dieu juste! et fait entrer dans l'homme tant d'azur
      Qu'elle a supprimé les patries!

  Faisant à l'homme avec le ciel une cité,
  Une pensée avec toute l'immensité,
      Elle abolit les vieilles règles;
  Elle abaisse les monts, elle annule les tours,
  Splendide, elle introduit les peuples, marcheurs lourds,
      Dans la communion des aigles.

  Elle a cette divine et chaste fonction
  De composer là-haut l'unique nation,
      A la fois dernière et première,
  De promener l'essor dans le rayonnement,
  Et de faire planer, ivre de firmament,
      La liberté dans la lumière.


LA TROMPETTE DU JUGEMENT

  Je vis dans la nuée un clairon monstrueux.

  Et ce clairon semblait, au seuil profond des cieux,
  Calme, attendre le souffle immense de l'archange.

  Ce qui jamais ne meurt, ce qui jamais ne change,
  L'entourait. A travers un frisson, on sentait
  Que ce buccin fatal, qui rêve et qui se tait,
  Quelque part, dans l'endroit où l'on crée, où l'on sème,
  Avait été forgé par quelqu'un de suprême
  Avec de l'équité condensée en airain.
  Il était là, lugubre, effroyable, serein.
  Il gisait sur la brume insondable qui tremble,
  Hors du monde, au delà de tout ce qui ressemble
  A la forme de quoi que ce soit.

                                Il vivait.

  Il semblait un réveil songeant près d'un chevet.

  Oh! quelle nuit! là, rien n'a de contour ni d'âge;
  Et le nuage est spectre, et le spectre est nuage.
  Et c'était le clairon de l'abîme.

                                    Une voix
  Un jour en sortira qu'on entendra sept fois.
  En attendant, glacé, mais écoutant, il pense;
  Couvant le châtiment, couvant la récompense;
  Et toute l'épouvante éparse au ciel est soeur
  De cet impénétrable et morne avertisseur.

  Je le considérais dans les vapeurs funèbres
  Comme on verrait se taire un coq dans les ténèbres.
  Pas un murmure autour du clairon souverain.
  Et la terre sentait le froid de son airain,
  Quoique, là, d'aucun monde on ne vît les frontières.

  Et l'immobilité de tous les cimetières,
  Et le sommeil de tous les tombeaux, et la paix
  De tous les morts couchés dans la fosse, étaient faits
  Du silence inouï qu'il avait dans la bouche;
  Ce lourd silence était pour l'affreux mort farouche
  L'impossibilité de faire faire un pli
  Au suaire cousu sur son front par l'oubli.
  Ce silence tenait en suspens l'anathème.
  On comprenait que tant que ce clairon suprême
  Se tairait, le sépulcre, obscur, roidi, béant,
  Garderait l'attitude horrible du néant,
  Que la momie aurait toujours sa bandelette,
  Que l'homme irait tombant du cadavre au squelette,
  Et que ce fier banquet radieux, ce festin
  Que les vivants gloutons appellent le destin,
  Toute la joie errante en tourbillons de fêtes,
  Toutes les passions de la chair satisfaites,
  Gloire, orgueil, les héros ivres, les tyrans soûls,
  Continueraient d'avoir pour but, et pour dessous,
  La pourriture, orgie offerte aux vers convives;
  Mais qu'à l'heure où soudain, dans l'espace sans rives,
  Cette trompette vaste et sombre sonnerait,
  On verrait, comme un tas d'oiseaux d'une forêt,
  Toutes les âmes, cygne, aigle, éperviers, colombes,
  Frémissantes, sortir du tremblement des tombes,
  Et tous les spectres faire un bruit de grandes eaux,
  Et se dresser, et prendre à la hâte leurs os,
  Tandis qu'au fond, au fond du gouffre, au fond du rêve
  Blanchissant l'absolu, comme un jour qui se lève,
  Le front mystérieux du juge apparaîtrait.


  Ce clairon avait l'air de savoir le secret.

  On sentait que le râle énorme de ce cuivre
  Serait tel qu'il ferait bondir, vibrer, revivre
  L'ombre, le plomb, le marbre, et qu'à ce fatal glas
  Toutes les surdités voleraient en éclats;
  Que l'oubli sombre avec sa perte de mémoire
  Se lèverait au son de la trompette noire;
  Que dans cette clameur étrange, en même temps
  Qu'on entendrait frémir tous les cieux palpitants,
  On entendrait crier toutes les consciences;
  Que le sceptique au fond de ses insouciances,
  Que le voluptueux, l'athée et le douteur,
  Et le maître tombé de toute sa hauteur,
  Sentiraient ce fracas traverser leurs vertèbres;
  Que ce déchirement céleste des ténèbres
  Ferait dresser quiconque est soumis à l'arrêt;
  Que qui n'entendit pas le remords, l'entendrait;
  Et qu'il réveillerait, comme un choc à la porte,
  L'oreille la plus dure et l'âme la plus morte,
  Même ceux qui, livrés au rire, aux vains, combats,
  Aux vils plaisirs, n'ont point tenu compte ici-bas
  Des avertissements de l'ombre et du mystère,
  Même ceux que n'a point réveillés sur la terre
  Le tonnerre, ce coup de cloche de la nuit!

  Oh! dans l'esprit de l'homme où tout vacille et fuit,
  Où le verbe n'a pas un mot qui ne bégaie,
  Où l'aurore apparaît, hélas! comme une plaie,
  Dans cet esprit, tremblant dès qu'il ose augurer,
  Oh! comment concevoir, comment se figurer
  Cette vibration communiquée aux tombes,
  Cette sommation aux blêmes catacombes
  Du ciel ouvrant sa porte et du gouffre ayant faim,
  Le prodigieux bruit de Dieu disant: Enfin!

  Oui,  c'est vrai,--c'est du moins jusque-là que l'oeil plonge,--
  C'est l'avenir,--du moins tel qu'on le voit en songe;--
  Quand le monde atteindra son but, quand les instants,
  Les jours, les mois, les ans, auront rempli le temps,
  Quand tombera du ciel l'heure immense et nocturne,
  Cette goutte qui doit faire déborder l'urne,
  Alors, dans le silence horrible, un rayon blanc,
  Long, pâle, glissera, formidable et tremblant,
  Sur ces haltes de nuit qu'on nomme cimetières;
  Les tentes frémiront, quoiqu'elles soient des pierres,
  Dans tous ces sombres camps endormis; et, sortant
  Tout à coup de la brume où l'univers l'attend,
  Ce clairon, au-dessus des êtres et des choses,
  Au-dessus des forfaits et des apothéoses,
  Des ombres et des os, des esprits et des corps,
  Sonnera la diane effrayante des morts.

  O lever en sursaut des larves pêle-mêle!
  Oh! la Nuit réveillant la Mort, sa soeur jumelle!

  Pensif, je regardais l'incorruptible airain.

  Les volontés sans loi, les passions sans frein,
  Toutes les actions de tous les êtres, haines,
  Amours, vertus, fureurs, hymnes, cris, plaisirs, peines,
  Avaient laissé, dans l'ombre où rien ne remuait,
  Leur pâle empreinte autour de ce bronze muet;
  Une obscure Babel y tordait sa spirale.

  Sa dimension vague, ineffable, spectrale,
  Sortant de l'éternel, entrait dans l'absolu.
  Pour pouvoir mesurer ce tube, il eût fallu
  Prendre la toise au fond du rêve, et la coudée
  Dans la profondeur trouble et sombre de l'idée;
  Un de ses bouts touchait le bien, l'autre le mal;
  Et sa longueur allait de l'homme à l'animal,
  Quoiqu'on ne vît point là d'animal et point d'homme;
  Couché sur terre, il eût joint Ëden à Sodome.

  Son embouchure, gouffre où plongeait mon regard,
  Cercle de l'inconnu ténébreux et hagard,
  Pleine de cette horreur que le mystère exhale,
  M'apparaissait ainsi qu'une offre colossale
  D'entrer dans l'ombre où Dieu même est évanoui.
  Cette gueule, avec l'air d'un redoutable ennui,
  Morne, s'élargissait sur l'homme et la nature,
  Et cette épouvantable et muette ouverture
  Semblait le bâillement noir de l'éternité.

  Au fond de l'immanent et de l'illimité,
  Parfois, dans les lointains sans nom de l'Invisible,
  Quelque chose tremblait de vaguement terrible,
  Et brillait et passait, inexprimable éclair.
  Toutes les profondeurs des mondes avait l'air
  De méditer, dans l'ombre où l'ombre se répète,
  L'heure où l'on entendrait de cette âpre trompette
  Un appel aussi long que l'infini jaillir.
  L'immuable semblait d'avance en tressaillir.

  Des porches de l'abîme, antres hideux, cavernes
  Que nous nommons enfers, puits, gehennams, avernes,
  Bouches d'obscurité qui ne prononcent rien;
  Du vide où ne flottait nul souffle aérien;
  Du silence où l'haleine osait à peine éclore,
  Ceci se dégageait pour l'âme: Pas encore.

  Par instants, dans ce lieu triste comme le soir,
  Comme on entend le bruit de quelqu'un qui vient voir,
  On entendait le pas boiteux de la justice;
  Puis cela s'effaçait. Des vermines, le vice,
  Le crime, s'approchaient; et, fourmillement noir,
  Fuyaient. Le clairon sombre ouvrait son entonnoir.
  Un groupe d'ouragans dormait dans ce cratère,
  Comme cet organum des gouffres doit se taire
  Jusqu'au jour monstrueux où nous écarterons
  Les clous de notre bière au-dessus de nos fronts,
  Nul bras ne le touchait dans l'invisible sphère;
  Chaque race avait fait sa couche de poussière
  Dans l'orbe sépulcral de son évasement;
  Sur cette poudre l'oeil lisait confusément
  Ce mot: RIEZ, écrit par le doigt d'Épicure;
  Et l'on voyait, au fond de la rondeur obscure,
  La toile d'araignée horrible de Satan.

  Des astres qui passaient murmuraient: 'Souviens-t'en!
  Prie!' et la nuit portait cette parole à l'ombre.

  Et je ne sentais plus ni le temps ni le nombre.

  Une sinistre main sortait de l'infini.
  Vers la trompette, effroi de tout crime impuni,
  Qui doit faire à la mort un jour lever la tête,
  Elle pendait énorme, ouverte, et comme prête
  A saisir ce clairon qui se tait dans la nuit,
  Et qu'emplit le sommeil formidable du bruit.
  La main, dans la nuée et hors de l'Invisible,
  S'allongeait  A quel être était-elle?  Impossible
  De le dire, en ce morne et brumeux firmament.
  L'oeil dans l'obscurité ne voyait clairement
  Que les cinq doigts béants de cette main terrible;
  Tant l'être, quel qu'il fût, debout dans l'ombre horrible,
  --Sans doute, quelque archange ou quelque séraphin
  Immobile, attendant le signe de la fin,--
  Plongeait profondément, sous les ténébreux voiles,
  Du pied dans les enfers, du front dans les étoiles!

NOTES


LA CONSCIENCE.

It has been thought that the subject of this poem was suggested to
Victor Hugo by a passage in _Les tragiques_, a satirical poem in
seven books, depicting the misfortunes and vices of France, written
by Théodore Agrippa D'Aubigné (1551-1630), whom Sainte-Beuve calls
the Juvenal of the sixteenth century. The passage relating to Cain
occurs in the sixth book, called _Les Vengeances_. The following
extracts indicate the spirit in which the author dealt with his
theme.

  Il avoit peur de tout, et il avoit peur de lui
  .      .      .      .      .      .      .
  La mort ne put avoir de mort pour récompense:
  L'Enfer n'eut point de morts à punir cette offense;
  Mais autant de jours il sentit de trespas:
  Vif, il ne vescut point; mort, il ne mourut pas.
  Il fuit d'effroi transi, troublé, tremblant et blesme,
  Il fuit de tout le monde, il s'enfuit de soy-mesme
  .      .      .      .      .      .      .
  Il possedoit le monde et non une asseurance;
  Il estoit seul partout, hors mis sa conscience,
  Et fut marqué au front affin qu'en s'enfuiant
  Aucun n'osast tuer ses maux en le tuant.

It is clear that if the poem suggested the subject to Hugo it
suggested nothing else.

With _Caïn_ may be compared _Le Parricide_, one of the 1859 series,
which is also inspired by the theme of the guilty conscience
pursuing the murderer. In this case remorse is symbolized by a
drop of blood which falls upon the head of the criminal wherever
he goes.

_Assur_, English Asshur; the name occurs in the marginal rendering
of Gen. x. II (Revised Version).

The names of persons and their descriptions are taken from the
account of Cain's descendants in Gen. iv. 17-23.

_Jabel_, English Jabal, son of Lamech, a descendant of Cain and
Adah. 'He was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.'

_Tsilla_, English Zillah, one of Lamech's wives.

_Jubal_, the brother of Jabal. 'He was the father of all such a
handle the harp and pipe.'

_Hénoch_, English Enoch, Cain's son.

_Tubalcaïn_, English Tubal-cain, the son of Lamech and his wife
Zillah. He was 'the forger of every cutting instrument of brass
and iron.'

_Seth_ was the third son of Adam and Eve, and

_Énos_ was the son of Seth.



PUISSANCE ÉGALE BONTÉ.

_Iblis_, one of the names used in the Koran for the Spirit of
Evil. He was a spirit who refused to prostrate himself before
Adam at the command of the Almighty, and was therefore expelled
from Eden. Instead of being immediately destroyed, however, he
was given a respite till the Day of Judgement. The word is derived
from the Arabic _balas_, wicked.

Another tradition, not found in the Koran, is that Iblis was a
warrior angel whom the Almighty sent to exterminate the Djinns, the
beings, half men, half angels, who inhabited the country of the
Genii. Instead of performing this command, the spirit rebelled and
was cast down into hell. It is hardly necessary to add that Hugo's
story is of his own invention.

_Bonté_ (see heading), one of Hugo's favourite words for
expressing the moral attributes of the Almighty power. The theme
that God is goodness, which is more than justice, is developed in
_Dieu: La Lumière_.

  La justice, c'est vous, l'humanité; mais Dieu
  Est la bonté.

Compare also the concluding lines of _Le Crapaud_.

The word has no exact equivalent in English. It comprehends
kindness, tenderness, and gentleness.

It may be interesting to note that Hugo was fond of comparing an
object composed of a centre and rays to a spider. Edmond Huguet
(_Les Sens de la Forme dans les Métaphores de Victor Hugo_) gives
the following examples:

  'De la hauteur où je suis, la rade pleine de nacelles (à
  quatre rames) figure une mare couverte d'araignées d'eau.'
                                           (_Alpes et Pyrénées_.)

  'Nous estimons une araignée chose hideuse et nous sommes
  ravis de retrouver sa toile en rosace sur les façades des
  cathédrales, et son corps et ses pattes en clef de voûte dans
  les chapelles.'  (_France et Belgique_.)

  'Les lanternes de ce temps-là ressemblaient à de grosses
  étoiles rouges pendues à des cordes, et jetaient sur le
  pavé une ombre qui avait la forme d'une grande araignée.'
                                              (_Les Misérables_.)

  Rostabat prend pour fronde, ayant Roland pour cible,
  Un noir grappin qui semble une araignée horrible.
              (_La Légende des Siècles, Le Petit Roi de Galice._)

  'Trois ou quatre larges araignées de pluie s'écrasèrent
  autour de lui sur la roche.' (_Les Travailleurs de la Mer._)

Hugo appears to have had a feeling of antipathy for the spider and
frequently chose it as the symbol of evil. In __Dieu: Le
Corbeau_,_ the spirits of good and evil are thus described:--

  L'un est l'Esprit de vie, au vol d'aigle, aux yeux d'astre,
  Qui rayonne, crée, aime, illumine, construit;
  Et l'autre est l'araignée énorme de la nuit.

In _La Fin de Satan_, of the days before the Flood,

  Depuis longtemps l'azur perdait ses purs rayons,
  Et par instants semblait plein de hideuses toiles
  Où l'araignée humaine avait pris les étoiles.

And of Ignatius Loyola,

  Sombre araignée à qui Dieu, pour tisser sa toile,
  Donnait des fils d'aurore et des rayons d'étoile.

Compare also:--

  La toile d'araignée horrible de Satan.
                           (_La Trompette du Jugement._)

In other passages the spider is a type of the unpleasant.

  La nuit, qui sert de fond au guet mystérieux
  Du hibou promenant la rondeur de ses yeux,
  Ainsi qu'à l'araignée ouvrant ses pâles toiles.
                         (_La Confiance du Marquis Fabrice._)

See also the passage from _La Bouche d'Ombre_, quoted in the notes
to _Le Crapaud._


BOOZ ENDORMI.

The subject of this exquisite little idyll is taken from the Book of
Ruth, chapter iii, in which Ruth the Moabitess is described as lying
at the feet of Boaz, the kinsman of her dead husband, Mahlon the
Hebrew, in order that she might claim from him that he should marry
her and continue the family of Mahlon, as provided by the law of
Moses.

_Judith._ There was a Judith, daughter of Beer the Hittite, one of
the wives of Esau (Gen. xxxvi. 34). Hugo may or may not have had
this personage in his mind.

_asphodèle_. Hugo is not always accurate in his local colouring.
Asphodels are not found in Palestine.

_Galgala_, the form found in the Septuagint and Vulgate of the
place-name Gilgal.

_Les grelots des troupeaux._ Here, again, Hugo is inaccurate.
Sheep in Palestine do not have bells attached to them.

_Jérimadeth_. The name seems to be of Hugo's own invention. It
was a trick of the poet's to make proper names suit the
exigencies of rime, as in this instance, in which
'Jérimadeth rimes with' demandait.

AU LION D'ANDROCLÈS.

It is impossible to name the period to which Hugo is referring
in this poem more precisely than by saying that it is the age of
Rome under the Empire. As will be seen from the notes, the
personages and events alluded to are not all contemporaneous.
It was enough for Hugo that they were typical of the Roman
decadence.

_Trimalcion_. The festival of Trimalcion is an episode in the
_Satyricon_ of Petronius Arbiter, the poem in which are
described all the excesses of Roman luxury and debauchery.
Petronius Arbiter lived in the time of Claudius.

_Lesbie_. Hugo is guilty of one of his inaccuracies here.
Lesbia was the lady to whom the poems of Catullus (87-47 B.C.?)
were addressed, while Delia, who is mentioned below in connexion
with Catullus, was in reality the mistress of Tibullus
(54 B.C.-19 A.D.).

_Crassus_. Hugo no doubt refers to M. Licinius Crassus
(died 53 B.C.), the Triumvir, who, when praetor, led an army
against the revolted gladiators under Spartacus. He twice defeated
them and subsequently crucified or hung, along the road from Capua
to Rome, six thousand slaves who had been taken prisoners.

_Épaphrodite_. Epaphroditus, a freedman and favourite of the Emperor
Nero, was the master of Epictetus, the lame slave and Stoic
philosopher, who was amongst the greatest of pagan moralists.
Epaphroditus, who treated his slave with great cruelty, is said to
have been one day twisting his leg for amusement. Epictetus said,
'If you continue, you will break my leg.' Epaphroditus went on, the
leg was broken, and Epictetus only said, 'Did I not tell you that
you would break it?'

Hugo seems to have in mind the short reigns of Galba (r. A.D. 68-9),
Otho (r. A.D. 69), and Vitellius (r. A.D. 69), all of whom perished
by violence.

_Vitellius_ was famous even among the later Romans for his gluttony
and voracious appetite. During the four months of his reign he is
said to have spent seven millions sterling on the pleasures of his
table. When at last the people rose against him, and the soldiers
proclaimed another emperor, Vitellius was found hiding in his
palace. He was dragged out into the Forum and killed on the
Gemoniae _(les Gémonies)_, a staircase which went up the Capitoline
Hill and on which the corpses of criminals were exposed before being
thrown into the Tiber. This is the _Escalier_ referred to in the
next line.

l. 57. These tortures were not known in Rome. They suggest rather
the Middle Ages.

_le cirque_. The circus where chariot-races took place. Hugo seems
to be confusing it with the Colosseum, where the gladiatorial
combats were fought.

_Le noir gouffre cloaque_. The Cloaca Maxima was the great sewer of
Rome. It is still in existence and in use. Hugo here first makes it
the symbol of the destruction towards which the Roman Empire was
tending, and then treats it half as a concrete reality, half as a
figure for some underworld in which dethroned but living emperors
meet. This blending of the symbol and the thing symbolized is
characteristic of the poet.

_chiffres du fatal nombre_: the figures or digits that stand for the
doomed number, i.e. the number with which a doomed man is marked.

_Attila_, the famous king of the Huns, 'the Scourge of God' as he was
called, reigned A.D. 434-53.


LE MARIAGE DE ROLAND.

The poem is founded on the 'Chanson de Girart de Viane,' one of the
Carolingian cycles of epic poems, written by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube,
a poet of Champagne who lived in the first half of the thirteenth
century.

The story, as told in the _Chanson_, is as follows:--

Girard, or Girart, the son of Garin of Montglave, a poor nobleman,
goes with his brother Renier to the court of Charlemagne to seek
his fortune. After being at court for some time he quarrelled with
the Emperor, owing to the latter marrying the widow of Aubery, duc
de Bourgogne, who was pledged to Girart. As a compensation for the
loss of his bride, he was given the Comté of Vienne, in Dauphiné.
When he presented himself before Charlemagne to do homage, the
queen, whose affection for her old lover had changed to contempt,
forced him by a trick to kiss her foot instead of that of her
husband. Some time after, Girart learnt the truth, and, furious at
the insult placed upon him, he rebelled against his sovereign.
Renier, who had been made duke of Genoa, with his son Olivier
and his daughter 'la belle Aude,' came to help him. Charlemagne
besieged Vienne with a great army, and amongst his warriors was
his nephew Roland, who was his principal champion, just as Olivier
was that of Girart. A siege, like that of Troy, ensued, many
doughty deeds being done by the two heroes. In the course of the
fighting Roland sees Aude and falls in love with her. He takes her
prisoner, and almost succeeds in carrying her off to his tent, but
Olivier rescues her. Finally, it is agreed that the quarrel between
the monarch and his vassal shall be settled by a duel between the
two champions. Needless to say, the latter fall in readily with the
proposal. Olivier is armed by an aged Jew, Joachim, who with others
of his nation had fled to Vienne with Pontius Pilate after the
Crucifixion, and had not yet succeeded in dying. The combat takes
place in an island in the Rhone, and la Belle Aude, with mingled
feelings, watches from a window her brother and her lover
contending for victory. The struggle is full of tremendous incident.
At the outset each of the champions cuts the horse of the other in
two and the fight is continued on foot. Olivier's sword is broken,
and Roland invites him to send for another and take a little rest
and refreshment. A boatman goes to Vienne and procures from the
old Jew a famous sword, called Hauteclere, and some wine. The fight
is renewed and lasts till nightfall, when an angel descends from
heaven, and orders the two heroes to be reconciled and to fight
together against the Saracens. The warriors embrace and Olivier
promises Roland the hand of his sister. Such was the beginning of
the friendship of the two mighty champions ofChristendom.

Hugo's poem, however, is not based directly on the story, but on a
modern prose adaptation by Achille Jubinal which appeared in _Le
Journal du Dimanche_ in 1846. Léon Gautier indeed, in _Les Épopées
françaises, says: `Victor Hugo s'est proposé de traduire notre
vieux poème, dont il avait sans doute quelque texte sous les yeux.'
But it is clear from the mistake about the word Closamont and other
details that Gautier was mistaken and that the source from which
Hugo drew was Jubinal's reproduction.

Hugo omitted from his adaptation two incidents of great poetic
interest, namely, the picture of Aude watching the fight, and the
miraculous intervention of the angel. He has, on the other hand,
inserted the barbaric incident of the fight with trees. He has
eliminated, that is to say, the tender and the religious elements
from the story and made it simply the narrative of a Homeric combat,
with more than a touch of the grotesque. Nevertheless, he has
retained the characteristic incident of the chivalrous behaviour of
Roland in sending for a new sword for his enemy and in giving him
time for rest, a trait which finds a parallel in many other
_Chansons_, notably in the story of the battle of Roland with
Ferragus, a Saracen giant. When Ferragus is worn out with fighting,
Roland watches over him while he sleeps, and on his awakening enters
into a theological discussion with him in the hope of converting him
to Christianity. When this pious desire fails, the combat is renewed.

_Saint Michael_ is described in Rev. xii. 7-9 as fighting against
Satan and casting him out of heaven.

Hugo is mistaken in his description of _Olivier_, who was not lord of
Vienne and a sovereign count, but only the son of Renier, duke of
Genoa. The only statement in these two lines which is correct is
that his grandfather was Garin.

L. 27. As already noted, in the original story it is an aged Jew who
arms Olivier for the fight.

_Rollon_ (English _Rollo_) was the Norse pirate who invaded France in
A.D. 912 and founded the Duchy of Normandy. The reference to him is
of course an anachronism.

_estoc_ (_c_ pronounced), a long narrow sword used for thrusting.

_cimier_ (from Latin _cyma_, the young sprout of a cabbage), the crest
on the helmet.

Roland's sword, _Durandal_, which was given him by Charlemagne, plays
the same part in the French _Chansons_ as Siegfried's sword
Balmung in the _Nibelunglied_, or Excalibur in the Arthurian cycle.
Other forms of the name are _Durendas, Durrenda, Durandarda_.

_en franc neveu du roi_, like a real or genuine nephew of the king.

_Tournon_, a town situated on the right bank of the Rhone, in the
department of Ardèche. It still produces a well-known wine, called
_Vins de l'Ermitage_.

1. 70. Here is a curious mistake, which Jubinal originated and Hugo
copied. Closamont was the original possessor of the sword, not
another name for the weapon. The lines in the 'Chanson de Girart de
Viane' are:--

  Une en aporte ke molt fut onoree.
  plus de c. anz l'ot li iuis gardee,
  Closamont fut, k'iert de grand renommee,
  li emperere de Rome la loee.

_Sinnagog or Sinnagos_ was the Saracen king of Alexandria with whose
attack on the castle of Garin, Olivier's grandfather, the story of
'Girart de Viane' begins.

1. 144. This is another deviation from tradition, as we have it in
the Carolingian cycle. Roland never married Aude. He was still
betrothed to her when he fell at Roncesvalles.


AYMERILLOT.

The poem on part of which this is based is an anonymous _Chanson_
written in the thirteenth century and belonging to the cycle known
as the cycle of _Guillaume_.

The story is as follows. Charlemagne is returning from Spain, after
the defeat at Roncesvalles, his army discouraged, his knights
exhausted, and wishing only to be at home and in comfort. Suddenly
he catches sight of a city, surrounded by a crenelated wall,
splendid within, with a palace the roofs of which shine in the sun,
its feet bathed in the sea, which is covered by the ships of its
commerce. Charlemagne wishes to attack it, but the duke of Bavaria
advises him to let it alone; it is garrisoned by thousands of
pagans and his men are exhausted. The Emperor addresses several of
his barons in turn, offering to each the city if he will take it.
One and all refuse: Charlemagne upbraids them for their cowardice,
bids them go home, and declares he will take the town by himself.
Then Hernaut de Beaulande brings forward his son Aimeri, who
volunteers to undertake the task. With the aid of one hundred
barons he captures the city and is made Count of Narbonne. Hugo has
selected the first and the best part of the _Chanson_ for
modernization. Léon Gautier (_Les Épopeés françaises_) says:
'Rien n'égale en majesté le début de ce poème, dont le dénoûment est
presque trivial... Rien de plus ennuyeux que le récit de tant de
combats contre les Sarrasins; rien de plus attachant que le tableau
de ce grand désespoir de Charlemagne à la vue de Narbonne, dont
aucun de ses Barons ne veut entreprendre la conquête. Il n'y a
peut-être dans aucune poésie aucun épisode comparable à ce discours
de l'Empereur, lorsqu'il crie à tous ses chevaliers: "Ralés vos en,
Bourguignon et François...je remenrai ici, à Narbonois." C'est
ce qu'a bien compris Victor Hugo, qui a si fidèlement traduit et
surpassé encore les beautés du texte original.'

Hugo's poem, however, is not based directly on the _Chanson_, but on
two prose adaptations written by Achille Jubinal, and published
respectively in the _Musée des Familles_ (1843) and the _Journal du
Dimanche _(1846). Yet these stories did little more than furnish the
framework for the poem, by far the greater part of which is the
original work of Hugo.

_à la barbe fleurie_, white-bearded. Expression taken from the
_Chanson_. In mediaeval poetry Charlemagne is always described as an
old man.

_Roncevaux_, which we call by the Spanish name Roncesvalles, is the
valley in the Pyrenees where Charlemagne's rearguard was attacked and
cut to pieces by the Moors during his retreat from Spain.

_Ganelon_, the knight through whose treachery the defeat of
Charlemagne at Roncesvalles was brought about.

_les douze pairs_. The twelve Paladins of tradition, who formed
Charlemagne's Round Table.

L. 6-10. These words are taken almost verbatim from Jubinal's
adaptation of the story in the _Musée des Familles_. Jubinal's words
are:

'L'etcheco-sauna (le laboureur des montagnes) est rentré chez lui
avec son chien; il a embrassé sa femme et ses enfants. Il a nettoyé
ses flèches ainsi que sa corne de boeuf, et les ossements des héros
qui ne sont plus blanchissent déjà pour l'éternité.'

In a note Jubinal says: 'Ces paroles sont empruntées au chant basque
d'Altabicar.'

_Son cheval syrien_. In the _Chanson_ Charlemagne rides on a _mulet
de Sulie (Syrie)_. Jubinal changed the mule into a horse. This is
one of the points of detail which show that Hugo followed the modern
author.

L. 25. The city, as we learn subsequently, was Narbonne. Narbonne is
on the west coast of the Gulf of Lyons, near the eastern end of the
Pyrenees. Originally a Roman colony, it was one of the chief seats of
the Visigoths, from whom it was taken by the Saracens, when they
overran Southern France. Charlemagne took it from the latter in 759.
Till the fourteenth century it was a port, but the sand has blocked
up the harbour and the town is now some distance from the sea.

_mâchicoulis_, battlements; or, more exactly, a gallery round the
tower with openings in it from which projectiles could be hurled
upon an enemy below.

_vermeil_. The word is one of Hugo's favourite adjectives, and is
used to suggest a bright vivid red, and almost invariably in
connexion with objects that have pleasurable associations.

The following are a few typical instances of its use:--

'L'aube vermeille.' (_Les Feuilles d'Automne: Madame, autour de vous_.)

'Les cônes vermeils' (du palais dans les nuages). (Ibid.: _Soleils
Couchants_.)

'Les beaux rosiers vermeils.' (_Les Quatre Vents: L'Immense Étre_.)

'Les astres vermeils.' (Ibid.: _La Nuit_.)

'Aux soirs d'été qu'embrase une clarté vermeille.' (_Dieu L'Ange_.)

'Les plats bordés de fleurs sont en vermeil: (_Eviradnus_.)

'Et, vermeille,

Mahaud, en même temps que l'aurore, s'éveille.' (Ibid.)

The word seems to be used without any definite suggestion of colour
in such phrases as 'des espaces vermeils' (_Plein Ciel_), 'quand le
satyre fut sur la cime vermeille' (_Le Satyre_), 'des arbres
vermeils' (of trees lit up by the setting sun) (_Le Crapaud_).

The word is used with a bold extension of meaning in _Les Voix
Intérieures: A Eugène_, where the appetite of boyhood is called
'l'appétit vermeil.'

_dromon_, mediaeval warship, worked by oars and sail, the ancestor
of the galley. The word is also used, as apparently here, for
merchantmen.

_Béarnais_, inhabitant of Béarn, the province in the Pyrenees from
which Henri IV came.

_Turcs_. This is of course a mistake for Saracens or Moors. The word
occurs in the original poem, Jubinal copied it, and Hugo copied
Jubinal. The original, it maybe noted, had 'trente mille Turcs,'
Jubinal cut them down to 'vingt mille.' Hugo's 'vingt mille' is
another detail which shows that his poem is based on Jubinal's
adaptation.

_preux_. The Old French adjective meant 'valiant.' At the present
time the word is only used in the phrase _preux chevalier. Preux_ as
a noun is rare, but de Vigny has 'Charlemagne et ses preux.'

_je ne farde guère_: I speak without affectation. _Farder_ used
absolutely in this way is rare.

_rendus_: knocked up, overdone.

_arbalètes_, crossbows.

L. 80, For the metaphor compare the _Chanson_ in _Les Châtiments_,
Livre VII

  Berlin, Vienne étaient ses maîtresses;
  Il les forçait,
  Leste, et prenant les forteresses
  Par le corset;
  Il triompha de cent bastilles
  Qu'il investit.--
  Voici pour toi, voici des filles,
  Petit, petit.

These two passages are good specimens of what Brunetière called Hugo's
barbarous and Merovingian humour, a species of humour which suits well
the reproduction of a mediaeval _Chanson_, even if it offends the
critical in a modern satire.

_gentil_, used in its original sense of 'noble'.

_maillot_, Old French form of _maillet_, a mace or club. _salade_,
head-piece worn by knights, a word used in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth centuries.

_duché_, which is now masculine, was formerly of the feminine gender.

_liais_, lias; _pierre de liais_ is Portland stone.

_douve_, as a term in fortification, means the wall of a ditch.

_estramaçon_, a long, straight, two-edged sword. The word is of
Italian origin and first came into use in the sixteenth century. In an
adaptation of a thirteenth-century _Chanson_ it is out of place, as is
_salade_ above.

_escarcelle_, a kind of large purse which was carried at the belt.

l 193. The reference to the Sorbonne, which was founded in 1252, is of
course an anachronism.

_estoc_. See note on MARIAGE DE ROLAND.

_bachelier_. In the Middle Ages the word was used of a young man of
good birth who, being too poor to raise his own standard, fought
under the banner of a knight, but not as a squire. The
juxtaposition of _Je suis bachelier_ with _Je sais lire en latin_
has given rise to the suspicion that Hugo, who found the word in
one of Jubinal's articles, understood it in the modern sense. In
the absence of further evidence, however, the poet may be
considered entitled to a verdict of 'not proven'.



BIVAR.

_Bivar_, in Spanish _Vivar_, was the name of the ancestral home of
the Cid. It is a castle near Burgos, in which the Cid was born in
1040.

_patio_ (Spanish), a court or open space in front of a house. The
_ti_ is pronounced as in French _question_.

_buenos dias_=good day.

l 18. The full name of the Cid was Rodrigue Ruy Diaz de Bivar, or in
Spanish Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar.

_campéador_. The Spanish word _campeador_, derived from _campear_,
to be eminent in the field, signifies _excellent_, _pre-eminent_,
and was the title given to their champion by the Spaniards, The
Moors called him the Cid, i.e. Seid, an Arabic word for _chief_.

_pavois_, an old word for a large shield, which protected the whole
body, and on which the Franks raised the king whom they had elected.

_richomme_, from the Spanish _ricohombre_, a title given to the
Barons of Aragon.

_servidumbre_ (Spanish), an establishment of servants. In Spanish
the last syllable is sounded.


EVIRADNUS. (PAGE 26.)

As far as is known, the story is of Hugo's own invention. The epoch
may be supposed to be the later Middle Ages, the place anywhere in
Teuton lands. The proper names are mostly of Hugo's own invention;
some are, however, echoes from German mediaeval history. The poem
and another called _Le Petit Roi de Galice_ form a section of the
_Légende_ called _Les Chevaliers Errants_.

l 1. There was a Ladislaus, King of Poland, in the fourteenth, and
a Sigismund, Emperor of Germany, in the fifteenth century. But the
personages of the poem are in reality wholly imaginary.

_stryge_ (written also _strige_), a vampire or demon that wanders
about at night. Derived from Latin _striga_, a bird of night, or a
witch.

_lémure_: Lémures (the singular is very rare) is the Latin
_lemures_, the disembodied spirits which haunted houses and caused
terror to the living.

_val_, valley, The word is now little used and only in poetry,
except in the phrase _par monts et par vaux_.

_preux_. See note on AYMERILLOT, l 54.

_munster_ (German), cathedral.

_bauges_, properly the lairs of wild boars.

_Amadis_, commonly called Amadis of Gaul, the hero of a celebrated
mediaeval poem, written originally in Spanish, which recounts his
heroism in war and constancy in love. He is the typical
knight-errant and true lover.

_Baudoin_. This is Baldwin, brother of Godfrey of Bouillon. He
became King of Jerusalem and died in 1118. During the Crusade he
went on a pilgrimage to the Holy City.

Sir G.Young in his _Poems from Victor Hugo_ suggests that _Corbus_
may stand for _Cottbus_, the capital of Old or Lower Lusatia.

_burg_ (German), a castle.

_guivre_ (also written _givre_), a heraldic term meaning a serpent.

_drée_, a fantastic stone ornament.

_fôhn_ (German _Föhn_), the south wind.

_le Grand Dormant_: Frederick Barbarossa, who, tradition says, never
died, but is still sleeping in a cave.

_roture_, i.e. his position as a peasant. _Roture_ is derived from
the Latin _ruptura_, the action of breaking the earth, and is the
base of the common word _roturier_.

_relève_, used in its feudal sense of 'to hold of'; the castle was
not feudally dependent on the city.

L. 214, i.e. the castle reflects the history of the ancient kings.

_les deux haches de pierre_. This is said figuratively and alludes
to the deeds of Attila, who ravaged the Eastern Empire and extended
his dominions almost to the Ural Mountains, whilst later on,
crossing the Rhine, he attacked the Goths of Southern France and
Spain.

_Lusace_, Latin Lusatia, German Lausitz, was a district between the
Elbe and the Oder, in what is now the kingdom of Saxony. But the
name has no significance. The personages and places in the poem are
in reality all imaginary.

_la griffe_ is the claw of a beast or bird of prey; _la serre_ is
the foot of a bird of prey.

_Sortent de leur tenaille_. A somewhat obscure expression.
Apparently _tenaille_ is used in the sense of 'vice', and the words
mean 'are of their manufacture or moulding.'

L. 291. i.e. the Emperor is the superior in rank.

_dromons_. See note on AYMERILLOT, L. 39.

_l'ordre teutonique_, the Order of Teutonic Knights. Originally
founded to protect the Christians in Palestine, the Teutonic
Knights received domains in Italy and Germany from the Pope and
Emperor, conquered Prussia (1228), and established there a military
power which lasted four centuries.

_hydre_. In Greek legend the hydra was a serpent with seven heads,
and, when one of them was cut off, two grew in its place. It is
Hugo's favourite figure for cruelty or tyranny.

_Lusace_ consisted of two margraviates, the upper and the lower.

_elle a peur du fleuron_, i.e. she is afraid to be marchioness. The
flower-shaped ornaments in a crown are called _fleurons_. A
marquis's coronet was adorned with 'fleurons' alternating with
pearls and the contrast between the pointed 'fleuron' and the round
pearl suggests the figure employed in the next line.

_tribunaux d'amour_, or _cours d'amour_, were the celebrated courts
of the Middle Ages, presided over by ladies of high rank, which gave
judgement in cases of love and gallantry and laid down laws for
lovers. They existed principally in France, especially in Southern
France.

L. 369. The Wends were a Slav people who lived in Lusatia, but the
name Thassilo is Bavarian.

_Nemrod_. See note on PLEINE MER, l.107.

_Fenris_: the great wolf of Scandinavian mythology whose growth was
such that the gods in fear chained him to a rock. Some day his upper
jaw will touch the sky, while his lower still rests on earth, and
then Odin will tremble for his throne.

_le serpent Asgar_. This serpent is probably of Hugo's invention and
its name taken from the mythical city of the Scandinavians, Asgard,
built by the gods and in which they often resided.

_l'archange Attila_. This is not the king of the Huns, nor is he one
of the known archangels. However, as the Scriptures mention only
three archangels, Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, out of the seven,
Hugo may or may not be right in speaking of an archangel of the name
of Attila. _Le grand chandelier_ brought from the lower regions by
the archangel is merely a poetic fancy and a reminiscence of the
seven-branched candlestick of the tabernacle (Exod. XXV. 31-7).

_Actéon_. Actaeon in Greek mythology was a hunter who saw Diana
bathing, and was in consequence changed by the goddess into a stag.

L. 437. _chanfrein_, the piece of armour which covered the head of
the horse.

_Les chatons des cuissards sont barris de leurs clés_. A difficult
line. The _chatons_ were the studs or screws which held the
thigh-piece (_cuissard_) in its place, and the instrument which
worked them was called _la clé_. _Barrés_ appears to mean simply
'fastened'. Sir G.Young translates:--

  'Their cuissart-studs up to the socket braced'

_boutoir_, the sharp spike on the knee-piece.

_crible_. The word refers to the visor with seven bars, which was
one of the marks of a marquis's rank.

_mortier_. The round cap which was the ancient emblem of
sovereignty in France. It was worn by barons who possessed full
powers of administering justice in their domains, also by the
presidents of the 'parlements', and by the chancellors. A modified
form is still part of the official dress of some of the judges of
the highest courts.

It will be noted that the antiquities in this passage are French,
not German.

_tortil_, a ribbon twisted round a crown, the special ornament of a
baron, not of a duke. It also signifies in heraldry a circular band
or pad to which heraldic negroes' heads were attached.

_rondache_, a round shield.

L. 492. The reference is to the coronet of a French marquis, which
bore eight jewelled ornaments, four of which consisted each of
three great pearls arranged as a trefoil, while the other four were
'feuilles d'ache,' the heraldic representation of the leaf of the
wild parsley.

_hydre_: see note on L. 323.

_timbre_, in heraldry, signifies anything placed above the
escutcheon to mark the rank of the person to whom it belonged. Here
Hugo seems to use it of the shield, perhaps because the triangular
shield was a mark of knightly rank.

_fauves_, here 'terrible'.

A chapter might be written on Hugo's bold and occasionally strange
uses of this word. Its primary meaning is either 'dull red' or
'tawny', but in Hugo's poetry it is used rather as a somewhat vague
epithet to suggest darkness, gloom, cruelty, savagery, or oppressive
power. It never denotes merely a physical quality; in such
expressions as 'leur fauve volée', speaking of the ravens in _La Fin
de Satan_, 'le désert fauve' (_Androclès_), 'son bec fauve', of the
vulture (_Sultan Mourad_), the suggestion of wildness or
ruthlessness predominates. Usually the word is used in a wholly
figurative sense. Thus in _La Fin de Satan_ the fallen archangel,
flying from Jehovah, is 'fauve et hagard', Barabbas stumbling
against the Cross is 'fauve', and of the lunatic in the tombs
it is said: 'fauve il mordait'. In all these cases the meaning is
'wild','savage '. In _Dieu_ we have `Vénus, fauve et fatale'
('cruel'), in _L'Ane_ les canons dont les fauves gueulées'
('terrible'), in _L'Année Terrible_'un hallier fauve où des sabres
fourmillent' ('wild'), and France is called upon to be 'franchement
fauve et sombre' ('fierce'). In the following passages we have
bolder uses still:

  Le  progrès a parfois l'allure vaste et fauve ('awe-inspiring')
  Et le bien bondissant effare ceux qu'il sauve. (_Dieu_.)

If man had been unselfish,

  L'ombre immense serait son fauve auxiliaire. (Ibid.)

Of war,

  Elle chantait, terrible et tranquille, et sa bouche
  Fauve bavait du sang dans le clairon farouche.
  (_Changement d'Horizon._)
  La fauve volupté de mourir. (_Mangeront-ils?_)

It is applied even to sound. 'Le fauve bruit' is used in _L'Ane_ of
the battles of primeval monsters, and more mystically in _La Vision
d'où sortit le livre_ of the passing of the Spirit of Fatality.

Also of smell

  Que l'homme au ciel s'égare ou qu'il fanatise
  Avec la fauve odeur des bûchers qu'il attise.
  (_Religions et Religion_.)

Nor must the strange well-known line in _La Bouche d'Ombre_ be
forgotten

  Le fauve Univers est le forçat de Dieu.

_Fauve_ is always used of what is dark and gloomy, just as
_vermeil_ is always applied to what is bright and pleasant.

_cimier_. See note on LE MARIAGE DE ROLAND.

_mélusine_. A heraldic figure, half woman, half serpent, bathing
in a basin. Taken from the name of a fairy, celebrated in the folklore
of Poitou.

_alérion_, a heraldic figure, representing an eagle without beak or
claws.

_le manche d'une guitare_ is the small end.

_bourguignotte_, a small helmet without throat-piece, so called
because it was first used by the Burgundians.

_Diane éblouissait le pâtre: a reference to the `old sweet mythos,'
as Browning calls it, of Diana, the goddess of the Moon, stooping
from heaven to kiss the shepherd Endymion, as he lay asleep on
Mount Latmos.

_Rhodope_, the wife of Haemus, king of Thrace, who was changed
into a mountain because she thought herself more beautiful than Hera.

1. 839. The allusions are to the quarrels between the Greek and
Roman Churches.

_galoubet_. A little wind instrument in shape like a flageolet, with
three holes. It was played with the left hand, while the right beat
a tambourine. It was peculiar to Languedoc and Provence.

_marche_, German _Mark_, military frontier.

_L'idée._ In the original edition of 1859 the word was L'épée.

_Josaphat._ The valley of Josaphat or Jehosaphat is between
Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and according to both Jewish and
Moslem
tradition is to be the place of the Last Judgment. This tradition
may be based on Joel iii. 12, or on the meaning of the word Josaphat,
which is, 'Jehovah will judge,' or on both.

_goules_, from Arabic _ghul_. English _ghoul_. The creatures who,
according to Eastern superstition, devour dead bodies.

_lamies_, from Lat. _lamia_, a fabulous being possessing the head of
a woman and the body of a sea-serpent, which was supposed to devour
children.

_en rupture de ban_. _Rompre le ban_ is to set at defiance a decree
of banishment, the punishment for which was death.

_un dogue en arrêt_. The name _dogue_ is given to a kind of large
dog, akin to a bloodhound, but the term is not correctly used here,
as _en arrêt_ means _pointing_.

_vermeille_. See note on AYMERILLOT.


SULTAN MOURAD.

In his preface to the volume of 1859 Hugo appeals to the history of the
Turks by Cantemir as a justification for his picture of Sultan Mourad.
This was Demetrius Cantemir (1673-1723), who had a remarkable history,
and wrote a valuable book. Though not a Turk, he attached himself to
the Turks, and fought under the banner of the Crescent during his early
life. In 1710 he was made Waiwode, or Governor, of Moldavia, Then,
deserting the setting for the rising sun, he allied himself with
Czar Peter the Great, then at war with Turkey. But the campaign was
unsuccessful, and Cantemir, flying from Moldavia, took refuge in the
Ukraine. For the rest of his life he divided his time between study and
instructing the Moldavians who had accompanied him. He is said to have
spoken Persian, Turkish, Arabic, modern Greek, Russian, Moldavian,
and Italian. The work to which Hugo refers was a history of the
aggrandizement and decadence of the Ottoman Empire. Written in Latin,
and translated subsequently into English, French, and German, it was
long the standard work on the subject.

It does not seem probable that Hugo had any particular Sultan in mind
when he delineated Sultan Mourad. Indeed the geography of the poem
suggests that he is depicting an idealized Oriental tyrant.

The nearest approximation to the monster to be found in the pages
of Cantemir is Ammath IV (r. 1623-40), of whose cruelty and
bloodthirstiness the historian gives a vivid account. His principal
exploit was the taking of Bagdad from the Persians, on which occasion he
slaughtered 1,000 of the citizens in cold blood.

For Hugo's conception of the power and influence of the Turkish Empire
when at its zenith, see _Le Rhin: Conclusion_, II, III.

_Liban_ is Lebanon.

_rampantes_. The word is used with the heraldic sense.

I. 19. The so-called Temple of Theseus (its real dedication is doubtful)
stands on a low hill just outside Athens. It is in a state of almost
perfect preservation. The nails which crowded its woodwork were
doubtless those on which the heads of slaughtered Greeks were fastened.
Of course in the Greek temple there was no woodwork, except possibly in
the roof.

_cangiar_, a short Turkish sword, with an almost straight blade, having
a single edge.

_Naxos_ is an island in the South Aegean Sea; _Ancyra_, a town in Asia
Minor.

_épiques_. A curious use of the word. It appears to mean `worthy of
epic poetry,' i.e. the spectres were those of great heroic men. In _Les
Chants du Crépuscule_ Hugo has 'des grenadiers épiques' (_Napoléon II_).

Elea, Megara, are towns in Greece, Famagusta is in Cyprus.

Agrigentum was a well-known Greek colony in Sicily; Fiume, at the head
of the Adriatic Sea, is now an Austrian port.

_Modon_, a maritime town in the Peloponnesus.

_Alep_, Aleppo. _Brousse_, a town in Anatolia.

_Damas_, Damascus.

_Tarvis_ (English Treviso) is a town in the province of Venice.

_boyard_. The boyards were the feudal nobles of Roumania and other
Balkan countries.

_Rhamséion_, a sepulchral monument built by Ramses III, king of Egypt,
in the fourteenth century B.C.

_Généralife_, the palace of the Moorish kings at Granada in Spain. It is
scarcely necessary to say that no Turkish Sultan ever held any part of
Spain.

_échouait_. The word is here used transitively (a rare use) in the sense
of 'drove against.'

_soudan_, a word of Arabic origin, was a mediaeval name for certain
Mahometan princes in Egypt and Asia Minor. The word seems here loosely
to designate the Turkish sultans.

_turbé_, a kind of small round chapel, usually attached to a mosque, in
which the tombs of Sultans and other great persons are placed.


LA CONFIANCE DU MARQUIS FABRICE. (PAGE 71.)

This is the third section of a poem called _L'Italie: Ratbert_. The
story is of Hugo's own invention, and is intended to delineate on the
one hand the savagery, and on the other the knight-errantry, of the
Middle Ages.

_Pharamond_, a somewhat legendary Frankish chieftain of the fifth
century A.D.

_Final_. The name, alone or in composition, is borne by three small
towns or villages on or near the Genoese coast. There was a marquisate
of Final in the Middle Ages.

_Witikind_. Hugo possibly had in mind the Saxon chief of this name
(A.D. 750-807) who for five years successfully resisted the power of
Charlemagne, and finally made an honourable peace with him. It does not
appear that he ever bore the title of king. His country was the ancient
Saxony, that is the country between the lower Rhine and the lower Elbe.
He had no connexion with Genoa, whither Hugo has dragged the Saxons
without justification.

_Albenga_: the name is taken from a small town on the Genoese coast, not
far from Final.

_abbé du peuple_, a name of a popularly elected magistrate at Genoa. The
office was in existence from 1270 to 1339.

_tribun militaire de Rome_: Latin, _tribunus militaris_; the officers of
the legion, six in number, who in republican times commanded in turn,
six months at a time.

_architrave_, the lower part of the entablature, that which rests
immediately on the column. To understand the line, it must be remembered
that the tower is conceived as a ruin.

_alleux_, a feudal term, signifying hereditary property. The word is
misused here in the sense of feudal dues.

_censive_. Another feudal term, meaning the dues owed by an estate to
the lord of whom it was held.

_balistes_ (from Latin _ballista_), mediaeval machines for hurling
stones and darts.

_le puits d'une sachette_, a hole in which a recluse lived. _Sachette_
(masc. _sachet_) was the name given to certain nuns of the Augustinian
order who wore a loose woollen garment (_sac_), whence the name was
derived. It afterwards became used of any recluse. In _Notre-Dame de
Paris_ Hugo applies it to the half-crazy inhabitant of the Tour-Roland.

_cruzade_, an old Portuguese coin, so called because it was marked
with a cross. There was an old cruzade worth about 3 fr. 30, and a new
cruzade worth not quite 3 fr.

_Narse_, or Narses, was king of Persia A.D. 294-303.

_Tigrane_, the name of an Armenian, not a Persian dynasty. There were
seven kings of this name, and they occupied the Armenian throne from 565
to 161 B.C.

_nonce_. This word is in strictness used only of the emissaries of the
Pope. Its use in any sense is an anachronism, as it was not introduced
till the sixteenth century.

_Ratbert_ is thus described at the beginning of the poem:--

  Ratbert, fils de Rodolphe et petit-fils de Charles,
  Qui se dit empereur et qui n'est que roi d'Arles.

Arles, which Hugo spells with or without the _s_ according to the
exigencies of the metre, was the capital of the kingdom of Provence, one
of the kingdoms formed out of the fragments of Charlemagne's empire. It
embraced most of S.E. France, and lasted from A.D. 855 to 1032. This
kingdom was frequently called _le royaume d'Arle_. _Roy d'Arle_ is
therefore a historical title, but the names Ratbert and Rodolphe, as
grandson and son respectively of Charlemagne, are imaginary.

_Macchabée_. Judas Maccabaeus, the Jewish hero, who freed his country
from the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes.

_Amadis_ See note on EVIRADNUS.

_Aétius_, a Roman general who lived in the fifth century A.D. One of
the last heroes and defenders of ancient Rome, he fought Franks,
Burgundians, Huns, and succeeded in uniting the German kings of Gaul
against Attila, and inflicting a crushing defeat upon him (A. D. 451).

_latobrige_. The Latobriges were an ancient German tribe who lived in
what is now Wurtemberg and Baden.

_Platon_: the Athenian philosopher Plato, justly placed amongst the
poets.

_Plaute_: Plautus, the Roman writer of comedies, who lived in the second
century B.C.

_Scaeva Memor_, a Roman poet and tragedian of the first century A.D.,
rescued from oblivion by this line. The three make a bizarre trio; see
note on BOOZ ENDORMI.

_Sicambre_. The Sicambres were the German tribe who in Roman times lived
on the Rhine.

_incrusté d'érable_, i. e. inlaid with maple.

_bailli_, i. e. governor.

_reître_, an old word, derived from the German _Reiter_, used of the
German knights.

_buccin_, properly a whelk, is a name given to a musical instrument very
similar to a trombone.

_brassière_, a little jacket or vest worn close round the body. The word
is usually used in the plural. Likely enough Hugo intends simply the
corset.

_au penchant des mers_, i. e. where the land slopes to the sea. A
peculiar expression; _au penchant de la terre_ would be more usual.

_les chouettes félines_. The epithet refers to their nocturnal habits.

L. 353. The antecedent of _que_ is _vautours_. The reference is to
gladiatorial combats in the Roman Circus, and the _louve d'airain_ is
the famous bronze wolf of the Capitol, a statue representing a wolf
suckling two children.

_fauve_, here `savage'. See note on ÉVIRADNUS.

_cru_, i. e. unashamed.

_faîte vermeil_. See note on AYMERILLOT, where the same phrase
occurs.

L. 391. figurant, 'suggesting the form of'. A highly characteritic
touch. Hugo possessed a faculty of poetic vision which changed the
shapes of things so as to bring them into harmony with the dominant
ideas of the moment. Cf. LA ROSE DE L'INFANTE, and LA CONFIANCE.


_Héliogabales_. Heliogabalus was a Roman Emperor (r. 217-222) noted for
his sensuality and his caprices.

_cistre_, cittern or cithern, a musical instrument resembling the
guitar.

_un Louvre_: the Louvre is the well-known palace in Paris where many
kings of France resided. Note the antithesis in the same line, _antre de
rois, Louvre de voleurs_.

_les ors_, various kinds of gold. _Sixte Malaspina_, introduced as one
of the counsellors of Ratbert in a poem entitled 'Ratbert' not given
here.

_chape_ is the Picard form of 'cape' (see note on LES PAUVRES GENS, l.
97). It is the name for a long cloak, fastened in front, and worn by
clergy and choristers when performing Divine Service. Formerly any long
loose cloak was called a _charpe_. As is still the custom in the Greek
Church, images of the Virgin or saints are largely used, and they are
found as ornaments on pieces of furniture and sacerdotal vestments.

L. 455. A peacock roasted whole and served up ornamented with its
feathers was a favourite dish at the banquets of the fifteenth century.

_hypocras_, an infusion of cinnamon, sweet almonds, amber, and musk in
sweetened wine.

_Le roi d'Arle_. See note to l. 179.

_l'araignée_. See note under PUISSANCE ÉGALE BONTÉ.

_jacque_ (also written jaque), a short close-fitting coat or tunic.

_vair_ (English _vair_), the fur of the squirrel, a highly esteemed and
costly material for dress in the later Middle Ages.

_chevalier haubert_, i. e. a knight who has the right to wear the
haubert or cuirass.

_Urbain quatre_, Pope (1261-. 1264). He is rightly described as the son
of a cobbler.

_Afranus_, introduced as the bishop of Fréjus, and one of Ratbert's evil
counsellors, in the poem of 'Ratbert'. See note on l. 435 _supra_.

L. 721. For the element of supernatural vengeance on cruelty compare
_L'Aigle du casque_, published in the 1877 series.


LA ROSE DE L'INFANTE.

A French critic has said happily of this poem: '"La Rose de l'Infante"
est un chef-d'oeuvre, digne d'être illustré par Vélasquez.' (Gaston
Deschamps in Petit de Julleville's _Histoire de la langue et de la
littérature françaises_.)

The little princess, of whom such an enchanting picture is given in this
poem, is an imaginary figure. There was no Infanta of five years of age
at the epoch of the Armada.

_ basquine_, a rich skirt worn by Spanish women.

_point de Gênes_, Genoese lace, which at one time rivalled that of Venice.

_fil d'or florentin_, gold thread of Florence.

_Duc de Brabant_ was one of the many titles of the King of Spain.

L. 69. See note on LA CONFIANCE.

_glas_ (pronounced _glâ_), 'passing bell.'

_vitreux_: 'glassy,' 'lack-lustre.' The sunken eyes seemed of an
unfathomable depth.

_Iblis_. See note on PUISSANCE ÉGALE BONTÉ,

_Escurial_. The vast and gloomy palace near Madrid built by Philip II in
the form of a gridiron in memory of St. Laurence, on whose feast-day he
won the battle of St. Quentin.

_L'Inde_. The inclusion of India in Philip's dominions can hardly be
justified. As King of Spain he possessed nothing in India, and as King
of Portugal only a few trading stations and fortresses.

For Hugo's conception of the power and position of Spain at this epoch,
see _Le Rhin: Conclusion_, II, III.

L. 130. Prescott describes Philip as being habitually grave in manner,
unsocial and sombre, and always dressed in black. The Order of the
Golden Fleece was the only jewel he ever wore.

L. 137. 'Better a ruined kingdom, true to itself and its king, than
one left unharmed to the profit of the Devil and the heretics.
'--Correspondence of Philip, quoted by Prescott in the History
of Philip II.

_Burgos_, the ancient capital of Old Castile. _Aranjuez_, a town in the
province of Toledo, where Philip had a summer residence.

_la toison d'or_, the Golden Fleece, an order of knighthood founded by
Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, in 1420.

_grincer un sourire_: a bold and vivid expression, _grincer_ meaning 'to
gnash the teeth.'

_gastadour_, from the Lat. _vastator_, ravager, despoiler.

_l'Escaut_, the Scheldt. The _Adour_ is a river in Southern France, but
no ships for the Armada came from France. One suspects the influence of
_gastadour_ in the line above.

_mestre de camp_, an old term for commander of a regiment.

L. 182. There were no German vessels in the Armada. _ourque_, more
usually written _bourque_, is a small Dutch or Flemish cargo-boat with
two masts. It is something between the modern ketch and the old Flemish
'bilander'.

_moço_, Spanish word for 'cabin-boy'.

_Pausilippe_, a promontory near Naples.


LES RAISONS DU MOMOTOMBO.

Placed by itself under the heading _L'Inquisition_ in the series of
1859, and preceded by the following note:--'Le baptême des volcans est
un ancien usage qui remonte aux premiers temps de la conquête. Tous
les cratères du Nicaragua furent alors sanctifiés, à l'exception du
Momotombo, d'où l'on ne vit jamais revenir les religieux qui s'étaient
chargés d'aller y planter la croix.' (SQUIER, _Voyage dans l'Amérique du
Sud_.)

Momotombo is a volcano in the state of Nicaragua. E.G.Squier was an
American antiquarian and author who was appointed _chargé d'affaires_
to all the Central American States in 1849. He does not appear to have
written any work with the title quoted by Hugo. The passage quoted
occurs in his _Nicaragua, its people, scenery, and monuments_, published
in 1852. He relates in this book an instance of a bishop being asked to
baptize a volcanic vent which had suddenly opened in a mountain!

_Torquemada_ (1420-1489) was the notorious inquisitor-general of
Castile and Aragon, whose name has become a by-word for relentless
persecution and cruelty.


LA CHANSON DES AVENTURIERS DE LA MER. (Page 101)

_le golfe d'Otrante_, between Italy and Albania.

_au Phare_: it is not clear what lighthouse is intended.

_une Tarentaise_, woman of Tarentum, in South Italy.

_Gaëte_, English Gaeta, a bay and town on the west coast of Italy, north
of Naples.

L. 47. The historical allusion here is not clear. Prince Eugene
of Savoy, Marlborough's colleague, and Cardinal Mazarin were not
contemporaries.

_Livourne_, Leghorn. _Spinola_: the reference may or may not be to the
famous Imperialist general in the Thirty Years War.

_prames_, big flat-bottomed boats, capable of carrying cannon, and used
for coast defence.

_Notre-Dame de la Garde_, a sanctuary at Marseilles.

_Palma_, a town in Majorca.



APRÈS LA BATAILLE.

Victor Hugo's father was an officer in the army of the great Napoleon
and fought in Spain as a general, but nothing is known of this incident
except what is here told.

_Caramba_ (Spanish), a colloquial interjection, implying surprise and
astonishment.

LE CRAPAUD.

To Hugo ugliness was as much a subject for pity as degradation or
misery. Compare the following passage from _Les Contemplations: Ce que
dit la Bouche d'Ombre_:--

  Pleurez sur les laideurs et les ignominies.
  Pleurez sur l'araignée immonde, sur le ver,
  Sur la limace au dos mouillé comme l'hiver,
  Sur le vil puceron qu'on voit aux feuilles pendre,
  Sur le crabe hideux, sur l'affreux scolopendre,
  Sur l'effrayant crapaud, pauvre monstre aux doux yeux,
  Qui regarde toujours le ciel mystérieux.

For Hugo's feeling for the brute creation, see _Dieu: L'Ange._

_Augustules_. The last Emperor of Rome, Romulus, was given by the people
the derisive nickname of Augustulus, or 'the little Augustus'. The
capture of Ravenna in his reign by Odoacer marks the end of the Western
Empire.

_vermeils_. See note on AYMERILLOT, 1. 35.

_miroitait_, glittered with light.

_farouche_, hard, cruel.

_fauve_, wild, shy. See note on ÉVIRADNUS, 1. 529.

1. 103. A difficult expression. Apparently it refers to the harsh
grating of the wheel against the side of the rut.

_connivence_: the complicity of the burden upon his back with his master
in keeping the ass in a straight course.

I. 134. i.e. the sad and melancholy, such as the ass, are equal to the
angels, if they feel pity.


LES PAUVRES GENS. (PAGE 110.)

_musoir_, the head of a pier or jetty.

_vertes couleuvres._ The serpent appealed to Hugo's poetic instinct, and
he saw its shape and its glitter in many natural objects. Compare the
following passages, for most of which I am indebted to Edmond Huguet's
_Métaphores et comparaisons dans l'oeuvre de Victor Hugo_:

La ronce, le serpent, tord sur lui ses anneaux. (_Eviradnus_, 1. 98.)

  On voyait sur ses ponts des rouleaux de cordages
  Monstrueux, qui semblaient des boas endormis.
              (_Pleine Mer_, ll. 125-6.)

  Ce sinistre vaisseau les aidait dans leur oeuvre.
  Lourd comme le dragon, prompt comme la couleuvre.
              (_Ibid._ 11. 116-17.)

  L'ail voyait sur la plage amie
  Briller ses eaux,
  Comme une couleuvre endormie
  Dans les roseaux.
               (_Dernière gerbe._)

  Par instants, dans cette profondeur vertigineuse, une lueur
  apparaissait et serpentait vaguement, l'eau ayant cette puissance,
  dans la nuit la plus complète, de prendre la lumière
  on ne sait où et de la changer en couleuvre.
               (_Les Misérables._)

  Là, c'est le régiment, ce serpent de batailles
  Trainant sur mille pieds ses luisantes écailles.
                (_Les Voix Intérieures._)

  J'ai vu au loin comme un long serpent de brume avec des
  écailles de soleil çà et là posé sur l'horizon... C'était l'Angleterre.--
                _France et Belgique._

  Dans ses flancs ténébreux, nuit et jour, en rampant
  Elle (_la terre_) sent se plonger la racine, serpent
  Qui s'abreuve aux ruisseaux des sèves toujours prêtes.
                         (_Souvenirs d'Enfance._)

_cape_, a cloak with hood, with which women protect their head and
shoulders. Used in Modern French only in a few provinces, except in
certain phrases such as _sous cape_, 'secretly'. The word is the same as
the English 'cape'.

_C'est la marine! Marine_ is often used as a nickname, as we say in
English 'Jack'. On the French coast the word is often familiarly used
in speaking to a man who is or has been a sailor, e.g. _Dis-donc, la
marine! Tiens, voilá la marine!_ In this case it means 'Here am I!'

_bonnet de forçat_, 'woollen cap worn by convicts and also by
fishermen.'

_chiffon_: used colloquially for a child, especially for a little girl.



PLEINE MER. (PAGE 118.)

_Analysis._ The vision of a gigantic derelict vessel on a boundless sea.
This is the old world, the past of grandeur and horror.

In the nineteenth century a monster warship was built on the Thames,
type of the spirit of that age. It carried two thousand guns; its
topmast was higher than St. Paul's; now it has become this derelict.

The old world was subject to many plagues and scourges. Its moving
spirit was Hatred, its characteristic, Division. Race strove with race;
vice, ignorance, superstition, cruelty prevailed.

Now the old world has vanished, the ship is deserted. What has become of
man? Look upwards!

_cachalot_. The cachalot or sperm-whale is one of the largest cetaceans,
often attaining a length of more than 80 ft.

_le grand mât_, the mainmast.

_déferle_ (of a wave), 'breaks.'

l.38. See the remarks, in the Introduction, on Hugo's treatment of
shadows.

_étrave_, the stern of a vessel.

_étambot_, the stern-post.

l.53. The vessel pitches as she meets the waves (_le tangage qui
brave_); the rolling throws up most foam (_le roulis qui fume_).

_éclat_, splinter.

_fauve_, savage, barbarous. See note on ÉVIRADNUS.

_Le dernier siècle_. "Pleine Mer" and "Plein Ciel" form a section of the
_Légende_, entitled _Vingtiérne Siècle_.

_sur la Tamise_. Hugo was hostile to England. He regarded the British
Empire as one of the two great dominions the shadow of which was
oppressing the world in the middle of the nineteenth century, the
other being Russia. England embodied "l'esprit de commerce, de ruse
et d'aventure". He developed this theme with a nervous and forcible
eloquence, if not with great political insight, in _Le Rhin: Conclusion_
(published in 1842).

_portemanteaux_, davits, on which the boats are slung.

_grelin_, a hawser or warp.

_palans_, tackle for raising heavy weights; block and pulley.

_amure_, rope by means of which the lower corners of a sail are held,
'tack.'

_se le passaient_, passed it along, i.e. the ship.

_Nemrod_. Nimrod is in Hugo the incarnation of the spirit of war. Cf.
especially _La Fin de Satan: Le Glaive_.

_pavois_, as a naval term, 'bulwarks.'

_vrille_, gimlet. The conception is of some immense spiked ram.

_alcoran_, the Koran. _Al_ is the Arabic definite article.

L. 191 refers to the texts in the Koran which order the death of those
who do not accept Mahometanism.

_simoun_, simoon, the hot wind of the Sahara.




PLEIN CIEL.

_Analysis_.

The vision of a ship in the sky. What is it? It is man, who has burst
the bonds that held him to earth and risen into the clouds. It is matter
soaring through the heavens.

First lyrical passage. The passage of the ship through the sky.

Description of the life in the ship; the absence of arms; the feeling of
power and joy. Description of the ship's movement.

Second lyrical passage. The voyage amongst the stars.

Whither will man go? He has thrown off his oid nature, his past history
is buried, he aspires to immortality.

Third lyrical passage. Is man to reach Heaven without death?

No, man must remain man, but the weight has been taken from his feet.
War has vanished; man is good and just.

Fourth lyrical passage. The ship is moving towards Virtue, Knowledge,
Right, Reason, Brotherhood, Justice and Love, and is carrying with it
man, who will find liberty and unity in the light.

_La Fable_, i.e. the myth of Aeolus.

_Eole_. Aeolus was the god of the Winds, which he kept fastened up in a
bag.

_fausse clef_, skeleton key.

_fatal_, 'charged with destiny.'

_pesanteur_. Not 'weight' but 'the force of gravity'.

_Nadir_ is the point in the heavens which would be reached if a line
were drawn through the centre of the earth and carried on till it
reached the sky. But here it seems to be used loosely for any distant
point in the heavens. The meaning is that from a remote distance the
round earth, as it came into view beneath the ship, would have the
appearance of a dusky comet.

_aéroscaphe_. A word once proposed, but never widely accepted, as a
designation for an airship. It is derived from the Greek _aer_ (air) and
_skaphe_ (a vessel).

_humaine_, i.e. made by man.

_treuil_, 'windlass.'

_moufle_, 'block.'

_moteur_, 'driving power.'

L. 171. i.e. by mathematics and poetry, that is by reason and
imagination combined.

_Euler_ was a Swiss geometrician (1707-83) who made great contributions
to mathematics and mechanics.

_Délos_. Tradition says that Delos in the Aegean Sea was once a
wandering island, and that Zeus fastened it down that it might be a home
for Latona, who was about to give birth to Apollo and Diana.

_Leibniz_ (English Leibnitz), the German mathematician, chemist, and
philosopher (1646-1716).

_Fulton_, the American inventor (1765-1815), who was one of the first
mechanicians to construct a steamboat.

_Képler_. The German Kepler (1571-1630) was one of the founders of
modern astronomy.

These three men are chosen as typical embodiments of the spirit of
progress.

_Simoun_. See note on PLEINE MER.

_mistral_. In the South of France the north-east wind is so called.

_Sous le renversement de l'urne_. The urn is the symbol of that
'Fatalité' which to Hugo was the dark shadow over human life. Cf.
LA TROMPETTE.

Andromeda, Orion, and the Pleiades are well-known constellations.
Arcturus is a star of the first magnitude in Bootes.

The Scorpion and the Archer are next each other in the heavens. The
lines express in a somewhat bizarre manner the effect of the outpouring
of life on the stars.

_Aldebaran_, a reddish star of the first magnitude in the constellation
of Taurus.

_Céphée_. Cepheus is the name of a constellation, as also is Perseus.

_des espaces vermeils_. See note on AYMERILLOT.

L. 232. _Zoroastre_. Zoroaster was the founder of the Persian religion.
He was a great observer of the stars.

L. 245. _Fatalité_. In Victor Hugo the word denotes, not so much
destiny, as the feeling or the doctrine that man is the helpless victim
of an unseen and cruel power. It is a gloom which overhangs human life,
from which in the progress of the ages man will be delivered. Compare
_La Vision d'où sortit ce livre_, where the spirit of 'Fatalité' is
associated with paganism and contrasted with the spirit of religion. In
_Dieu_ again 'Fatalité' is one of the three sombre deities of paganism,
the other two being Venus, the goddess of pleasure, and Hecate, the
goddess of death. Cf. also the following lines from _La Fin de Satan_,
put into the mouth of man's evil angel:--

  Je suis Lilith-Isis, l'âme noire du monde.
  Tremble! l'être inconnu, funeste, illimité,
  Que l'homme en frémissant nomme Fatalité,
  C'est moi. Tremble! Ananké, c'est moi. Tremble! Le voile
  C'est moi.

And again in Satan's speech to the Almighty:--

  Tu seras Providence et moi Fatalité.

_Notre-Dame de Paris_ is based upon this theme. See especially Livre
VII. iv.

L. 255. For the metaphor compare 'la fausse clef du fatal gouffre bleu',
l. 37, and the following passage in _L'Ane_ about the prison of life:--

  La porte en est massive et la voûte en est dure;
  Tu regardes parfois au trou de la serrure,
  Et tu nommes cela science; mais tu n'as
  Pas de clef pour ouvrir le fatal cadenas.

L. 273. Cf. the well-known line in _Les Contemplations: Ce que dit la
Bouche d'Ombre_:--

  Le fauve univers est le forçat de Dieu.

Man is likened to a convict, in that he is undergoing punishment, not in
that he deserves it.

_Allioth_, a star of the first magnitude in the Great Bear.

_J'en arrive_: 'Tis from there I come.

_la pesanteur_. Gravity symbolizes the forces which keep man down.

_guèbres_, fire-worshippers, i.e. the Persians, who still adhere to the
ancient religion of Zoroaster. The word itself is Persian.

_Thalès_ (English Thales), one of the seven wise men of Greece.

L. 317. An allusion to the well-known doctrine of the music of the
spheres, enunciated by Plato.

_chouette_. The owl, as a bird of darkness, was to Hugo suggestive of
evil things. Cf. _La Confiance_.

_frisson des roseaux_, i.e. a trembling like that of reeds.

_Spinosa_ (English Spinoza) (1632-77), the Jewish philosopher, whose
rationalistic views would be evidence to Hugo of his need of faith.

_Hobbe_. Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), the famous English philosopher, is
best known by his defence of absolute monarchy. In ethics he held that
man is swayed only by the desire for pleasure and the fear of pain.
Either of these views would be to Hugo a system of despair.

_Erèbe_ (Erebus) was originally one of the Titans who was cast by Zeus
into Tartarus. The word is thus used as a synonym for the lower world,
especially those regions where evil deeds are expiated.

_fatalité_. See note on l. 245.

_géhenne_. Gehenna was the valley near Jerusalem where crimmals were
executed. In the New Testament it is used as a synonym for hell.

Nimrod is again the embodiment of the spirit of war. Aaron typifies
ecclesiastical resistance to progress.

_Beccaria_ was an Italian publicist (1738-94) who worked for the reform
of the penal law. His principal work was a small volume called _Treatise
on Crime and Punishment_, which was translated into nearly every
language in Europe. His opposition to the use of torture, to the
infliction of the death penalty, and to arbitrary arrest no doubt
appealed specially to Hugo.

_Dracon_, i.e. Draco, the Athenian legislator, the memory of the
excessive severity of whose laws lingers in our adjective _draconian_.

_Empédocle_. Empedocles was a Greek philosopher who was born in Sicily
about 450 B.C. He is best remembered from the tradition that he threw
himself down Etna in despair at his incapacity to solve the problem of
its action.

_Prométhée_. Prometheus was the Titan who stole fire from heaven and
gave it to men, for which Zeus chained him to a rock in the Caucasus. In
legend and poetry he figures as the benefactor and civilizer of mankind.

_pesanteur_. See note on l. 305.

_l'antique idéal_, the ancient visions,
as for instance those of Isaiah and Virgil, of a golden age.

_farouche_, i. e. that has never been realized.

IV

STUDY AND CRITICISM.

The studies and criticisms on Hugo form a large and ever-increasing
library. The most remarkable among them are the following:

SAINTE-BEUVE. _Critiques et Portraits littéraires_. Articles on Victor
Hugo. 1832.
GUSTAVE PLANCHE. _Nouveaux portraits littéraires_. Studies and
criticisms on some of Hugo's plays. 1832-8.
_Revue des Deux Mondes_, passim. Articles by Gustave Planche, A.
Fontaney, and Charles Magnin.
CHARLES ASSELINEAU. _Mélanges d'une bibliothèque romantique_. 1867.
LEONARD DE LOMÉNIE. _Galerie des contemporains illustres_. Vol. I. 1879.
GUSTAVE DESSOFFY (le comte). _Discours sur la vie littéraire de Victor
Hugo_. 1845.
ELISA CHEVALIER. _La Vérité sur Victor Hugo_. 1850.
EUGÈNE DE MIRECOURT. _Victor Hugo_. 1854.
HIPPOLYTE CASTILLE. _Victor Hugo_.
A. MAZURE. _Les Poètes contemporains_.
ERNEST HAMEL. _Victor Hugo_. 1860.
ALFRED NETTEMENT. _Victor Hugo_. 1862.
MADAME VICTOR HUGO. _Victor Hugo, raconté par un témoin de sa vie_. 2
vols. 1863.
PAUL DE SAINT-VICTOR. _Victor Hugo_. 1885.
E. Dupuis. _Victor Hugo, l'homme et le poète_. 1897.
PETIT DE JULLEVILLE. _Histoire de la littérature française_. 1894-1900.
CH. RENOUVIER. _Victor Hugo, le Poète et le philosophe_. 2 vols. 1900.
A. SLEUMER. _Die Dramen von Hugo_. Berlin, 1901.
GASTON DESCHAMPS. _Conférences sur Victor Hugo_. 1898.
ÉMILE FAGUET. _Histoire de la littérature française_. 1900.

And a host of articles by such critics as Émile Montégut, Émile Augier,
Edmond Scherer, without speaking of the innumerable notes and criticisms
which have appeared on Hugo and his work in daily papers and periodicals
both in France and in foreign countries.


V.

PORTRAITS.

These are extremely numerous, but previously to 1851, that is, before
Hugo left France, they all represent him as a clean-shaven man. After
his exile Hugo grew a beard, hence the alteration so noticeable in the
portraits subsequent to 1851.

The portrait chosen represents Hugo in his youth, at the time of the
first appearance of _Notre-Dame de Paris_.

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689

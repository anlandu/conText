CHARACTERS


AKULÍNA. An old woman of seventy, brisk, dignified, old-fashioned.

MICHAEL. Her son, thirty-five years old, passionate, self-satisfied,
vain and strong.

MARTHA. Her daughter-in-law, a grumbler, speaks much and rapidly.

PARÁSHKA. Ten years old, daughter of Martha and Michael.

TARÁS. The village elder's assistant, speaks slowly and gives himself
airs.

A TRAMP. Forty years old, restless, thin, speaks impressively; when
drunk is particularly free and easy.

IGNÁT. Forty years old, a buffoon, merry and stupid.




                           THE CAUSE OF IT ALL




ACT I

    Autumn. A peasant's hut, with a small room partitioned off. Akulína
    sits spinning; Martha the housewife is kneading bread; little
    Paráshka is rocking a cradle.


MARTHA. Oh dear, my heart feels heavy! I know it means trouble; there's
nothing to keep him there. It will again be like the other day, when he
went to town to sell the firewood and drank nearly half of it. And he
blames me for everything.

AKULÍNA. Why look for trouble? It is still early, and the town is a long
way off. For the present ...

MARTHA. What do you mean by early? Akímych is back already. He started
after Michael but Michael's not back yet! It's worry worry all day long;
that's all the pleasure one gets.

AKULÍNA. Akímych took his load straight to a customer; but our man took
his to sell at the market.

MARTHA. If he were alone I shouldn't worry, but Ignát is with him; and
when he's with that lousy hound (God forgive me!), he's sure to get
drunk. Early and late one toils and moils. Everything is on our
shoulders! If one only got anything by it! But no! hustling about all
day long is all the pleasure one gets.

    Door opens and Tarás enters with a ragged Tramp.

TARÁS. Good day to you! I've brought a man who wants a night's
lodging.[1]

  [1] It is customary for the village authorities to quarter tramps on
  each peasant household in a village in turn, or in such order as
  appears convenient.

TRAMP [bows] My respects to you.

MARTHA. Why do you bring them to us so often? We put up a tramp last
Wednesday night; you always bring them to us. You should make Stepanída
put them up; there are no children there. It's more than I can do to
look after my own family, and you always bring these people to us.

TARÁS. Everyone in turn has to put them up.

MARTHA. It's all very well to say "everyone in turn," but I have
children, and besides, the master is not at home to-day.

TARÁS. Never mind, let the fellow sleep here to-night; he'll not wear
out the place he lies on.

AKULÍNA [to Tramp] Come in and sit down, and be our guest.

TRAMP. I tender my gratitude. I should like a bite of something, if
possible.

MARTHA. You haven't had time to look round, and want to eat already.
Didn't you beg anything in the village?

TRAMP [sighs] I'm not in the habit of begging because of my position,
and having no producks of my own ...

    Akulína rises, goes to the table, takes a loaf of bread, cuts a
    slice, and gives it to the Tramp.

TRAMP [taking the bread] Merci.[2] [Sits down on the bench and eats
greedily].

  [2] The tramp, who has had some acquaintance with educated
  Revolutionaries, tries to introduce foreign words, or words not
  generally used by workmen, into his talk. In this instance he used the
  French word _merci_ instead of the plain "thank you."

TARÁS. And where is Michael?

MARTHA. Why, he took hay to the town. It's time he was back, but he's
not here. Something must have happened.

TARÁS. Why, what should happen?

MARTHA. What indeed? Not anything good; it's only bad one has to expect.
As soon as he's out of the house he forgets all about us! I expect he'll
come back tipsy!

AKULÍNA [sitting down to spin, points at Martha and says to Tarás] It's
not in her to be quiet. As I always say, we women must find something to
grumble about.

MARTHA. If he were alone I should not be afraid, but he went with Ignát.

TARÁS [smiling] Ah well, Ignát Ivánovich certainly is fond of a drop of
vódka.

AKULÍNA. Doesn't he know what Ignát is like! Ignát is one man, and our
Michael's another.

MARTHA. It's all very well for you to talk, mother; but I'm sick of his
drinking. While he is sober it would be a sin to complain of him, but
when he's drunk, you know what he is like. One can't say a word;
everything is wrong.

TARÁS. Yes, but look at you women too; a man has a drink. Well, he
swaggers about a bit, and sleeps it off, and everything goes on all
right; but then the likes of you keep on nagging at him.

MARTHA. When he's drunk there's no pleasing him, do what you will.

TARÁS. But you should understand that we can't help having a drop now
and then. Your woman's business is at home, but the likes of us must
have a drop when we're on business, or for company's sake. Well, so one
drinks, and where is the harm?

MARTHA. You may talk, but it's hard on us women. Oh, how hard it is! If
one harnessed you men to our work just for a week, you would sing a
different tune. Kneading, cooking, baking, spinning, weaving, and the
cattle to look after, and all the rest of it, and the brats to keep
washed and clothed and fed; it's all on our shoulders, and if anything
is the least bit not to his fancy, there you are, especially when he's
drunk. Oh dear, what a life ours is!

TRAMP [chewing] That's quite correct. It's the cause of it all; I mean
all the catastrophes of life proceed from alcoholic liquors.

TARÁS. It seems to have bowled you over too!

TRAMP. No, not exactly that, though I have suffered from that too. The
career of my life might have been different but for the drink.

TARÁS. Now, to my thinking, if you drink reasonably, there's no manner
of harm in it.

TRAMP. But I say that it is so strong that it may completely ruin a man.

MARTHA. That's what I say: you worry and do your best, and the only
comfort you get is to be scolded and beaten like a dog.

TRAMP. And that's not all. There are some people, persons I mean, that
are quite deprived of their reason through it and commit entirely
inappropriate actions. While he does not drink, give him anything you
like and he won't take what is not his; but when drunk, he grabs
whatever comes handy. Many a time one gets beaten and put in prison. As
long as I don't drink, all goes honestly and honourably, but as soon as
I drink, I mean as soon as that same person drinks, he at once begins
grabbing whatever comes his way.

AKULÍNA. And I think it's all in oneself.

TRAMP. Of course it's in oneself as long as one is well, but this is a
kind of disease.

TARÁS. A nice kind of disease. A good hiding would soon cure that
disease. Well, goodbye for the present. [Exit].

MARTHA [wipes her hands and turns to go].

AKULÍNA [sees that the Tramp has finished his bread] Martha, I say,
Martha! Cut him another piece.

MARTHA. Bother him, I must get the samovár to boil. [Exit].

    Akulína rises, goes to the table, cuts a chunk of bread and gives it
    to the Tramp.

TRAMP. _Merci_, I have acquired a great appetite.

AKULÍNA. Are you a workman?

TRAMP. Who? I? I was a mechanic.

AKULÍNA. And what wages did you get?

TRAMP. I used to get fifty, and even seventy roubles, a month.

AKULÍNA. That's a good lot! Then how have you come down so low?

TRAMP. Come down! I'm not the only one. I've come down because the times
are such that it is impossible for an honest man to live.

MARTHA [brings in the samovár] Oh Lord! it's certain sure he'll come
home drunk. I feel it in my heart.

AKULÍNA. I'm afraid he must really have gone on the spree.

MARTHA. There it is. One struggles and struggles and kneads and bakes
and cooks and spins and weaves and tends the cattle; everything on one's
own shoulders. [The baby in the cradle cries] Paráshka, rock the boy. Oh
dear, what a life it is for us women. And when he is drunk, nothing is
right!... If one only says a word he doesn't like ...

AKULÍNA [making the tea] And this is the last of the tea. Did you tell
him to get some?

MARTHA. Of course. He said he would, but he'll have forgotten all about
his home!... [She puts the samovár on the table].

    The Tramp moves away.

AKULÍNA. Why do you leave the table? We are going to drink tea.

TRAMP. I tender my gratitude for the hearty hospitality. [Throws away
the cheap cigar[3] he was smoking and comes to the table].

  [3] The "cigar" will have probably consisted of some bad tobacco
  rolled up in a bit of newspaper.

MARTHA. And what sort do you belong to? Peasants, or some other?

TRAMP. Well, I'm not of the peasant class, nor of the aristocracy. I'm
of the double-edged class.

MARTHA. What's that? [hands him a cup of tea].

TRAMP. _Merci._ Why this; that my father was a Polish Count, and besides
him I had many others; and I also had two mothers. In general my
biography presents many difficulties.

MARTHA. Have another cup? Well, did you get any learning?

TRAMP. My learning has also been very uncircumstantial. Not my mother,
but my godmother apprenticed me to a blacksmith. That blacksmith was my
first perdagogue; and his perdagogy consisted in this--that he did not
beat his anvil as often as he beat my unfortunate head. Nevertheless,
however much he hit me, he could not deprive me of talent. Then I went
to a locksmith's, and there I was appreciated, and became foreman. I
made acquaintance with educated people, and belonged to a political
faction. I was able to master intellectual literature; and my life might
have been elevated for I possessed immense talent.

AKULÍNA. Of course.

TRAMP. But here came an upset. The despotic yoke oppressing the life of
the people! I got into prison; I mean, I suffered the incarceration of
freedom.

MARTHA. What for?

TRAMP. For our rights.

MARTHA. What rights?

TRAMP. What rights? Why the rights that the bourgeois should not feast
continually, and that the labouring proletariat might reap the rewards
of labour.

AKULÍNA. And get back the land, I suppose?

TRAMP. Well naturally. The Agromoric question too.

AKULÍNA. May God and the Holy Queen of Heaven grant it. We are that
pressed for land. Well, and how are things now?

TRAMP. Now? I am off to Moscow. I shall go to an exploiter of labour.
Can't be helped; I shall humble myself and say--give me what work you
will, only take me.

AKULÍNA. Well, have some more tea.

TRAMP. Thank you; _merci_ I mean.

    Noise and talk in the passage outside.

AKULÍNA. Here's Michael, just in time for tea.

MARTHA [rises] Oh, my goodness, Ignát is with him! That means he's
drunk.

    Michael and Ignát stagger in.

IGNÁT. How are you all? [Crosses himself before the icon] Here we are,
damn you, just in time for tea. We went to church, service was done; we
went to dine, all eaten and gone; to the pub, we went in, just time to
begin. Ha, ha, ha! You give us some tea and we'll give you some vódka.
That's fair. [Laughs].

MICHAEL. Where has this swell come from? [Points to Tramp. Takes a
bottle from the bosom of his coat and puts it on the table] Bring some
cups.

AKULÍNA. Well, did you get on all right?

IGNÁT. Nothing could be better, damn you; drank, and had a spree, and
have brought some home.

MICHAEL [fills the cups with vódka, hands one to his mother and then one
to the Tramp] Drink, you too!

TRAMP [taking cup] I offer most heartfelt thanks. Your health. [Empties
the cup].

IGNÁT. Fine fellow, how he swills, damn him! I should think hunger makes
it run through all his veins. [Pours out some more].

TRAMP [drinks] I wish you success in all your undertakings.

AKULÍNA. Well, did you get a good price for the hay?

IGNÁT. Good or bad, we've drunk it all, damn you! Am I right, Michael?

MICHAEL. Why, of course. It's not made to be looked at! One must have
some fun once in a hundred years.

MARTHA. What are you swaggering for? There's not much good in that.
We've nothing to eat at home, and see what you're doing.

MICHAEL [threateningly] Martha!

MARTHA. Well, what of Martha? I know I'm Martha. Oh, it makes me sick to
look at you.

MICHAEL. Martha, look!

MARTHA. There's nothing to see. I don't want to look.

MICHAEL. Pour out the vódka and serve it round to our visitors.

MARTHA. Faugh, you bleary-eyed hound. I don't want to speak to you.

MICHAEL. You don't? Ah, you baggage, what did you say?

MARTHA [rocks cradle. Paráshka is frightened and comes to her] What I
said? I said I do not want to talk to you, that's all.

MICHAEL. Have you forgotten? [Jumps up from the table, strikes her on
the head and knocks off her kerchief] One!

MARTHA. Oh! Oh! Oh! [Runs crying to the door].

MICHAEL. You'll not get away, you jade! [Rushes at her].

TRAMP [jumps up from the table and seizes his arm] You have no kind of
complete right.

MICHAEL [stops and looks at Tramp with surprise] Is it long since you
had a thrashing?

TRAMP. You have no complete right to subject the female sex to insults.

MICHAEL. Oh, you son of a bitch! Do you see this? [Shows his fist].

TRAMP. I will not allow exploitations to be performed on the female sex.

MICHAEL. I'll give you such an extolpation that you'll not know which
end you stand on....

TRAMP. Go on, strike away! Why don't you? [Holds out his face].

MICHAEL [shrugs his shoulders and spreads out his arms] Suppose I really
go for you?

TRAMP. I tell you, strike!

MICHAEL. Well, you are a rum chap, now I come to look at you. [Drops his
arms and shakes his head].

IGNÁT [to Tramp] One sees at once that you're pretty sweet on the women,
damn you!

TRAMP. I stand up for their rights.

MICHAEL [to Martha as, breathing heavily, he steps to the table] Well
Martha, you must set a big candle before the saints for his sake. But
for him, I'd have beaten you to a jelly.

MARTHA. What else can one expect of you. One worries all one's life,
baking and cooking; and as soon as ...

MICHAEL. Now, have done, have done! [Offers vódka to the Tramp] Drink.
[To his wife] And what are you slobbering for? Mayn't a fellow have his
joke? There you are [gives her money], put it away. Here are two
three-rouble notes and two twenty-copeck pieces.

MARTHA. And the tea and sugar I wanted?

MICHAEL [takes parcel from his pocket and hands it to his wife. Martha
takes the money and the parcel and goes into the little room, silently
arranging the kerchief on her head] What an unreasonable lot these women
are. [He again offers vódka to the Tramp] There, drink.

TRAMP [declining it] Drink it yourself.

MICHAEL. Come now, don't fuss.

TRAMP [drinking] Success to you.

IGNÁT [to Tramp] You must have seen many a strange sight, I suppose.
Oh, what a fine coat you've got! Latest fashion. Where did you get it
from? [pointing to Tramp's tattered jacket]. Don't you mend it, it's
fine as it is! It's getting on in years, I fancy. Well, it can't be
helped. If I had one like it, the women would be sweet on me too! [To
Martha] Ain't that true?

AKULÍNA. You should not, Ignát Iványch. Before seeing anything of him,
why go and hold up a man to laughter?

TRAMP. It comes of his uneducatedness.

IGNÁT. I'm doing it friendly-like. Drink [offers vódka].

AKULÍNA. He says himself--it's the cause of all evil--and he's been in
prison because of it.

MICHAEL. What were you in prison for?

TRAMP [very drunk] I've suffered for expropriation.

MICHAEL. What's that?

TRAMP. Why, this way. Came up to a fat paunch: "Give up your money, else
here's a levolver."[4] He tries this way and that, but forks out 2,300
roubles.

  [4] As usual he mispronounces his word and calls a "revolver" "a
  levolver."

AKULÍNA. Oh Lord!

TRAMP. We meant to dispose of it the proper way. Zembrikóf was our
leader. Then those ravens swooped down on us. At once under arrest, and
into prison.

IGNÁT. And took the money away?

TRAMP. Of course. Only they could not convict me. At the trial the
procurator said these words to me: "You've stolen money" says he; and I
answer him straight: "Thieves steal, but we have performed an
expropriation for our Party." And he didn't know what to say. He tried
this way and that, but couldn't answer me. "Lead him," says he, "to
prison," that is--to the incarceration of free life.

IGNÁT. Clever dog! A regular brick! [Offering vódka] Drink, damn you.

AKULÍNA. Fie, how nastily you speak!

IGNÁT. I, Grannie? I don't mean it for abuse; it's a manner of speech of
mine. Damn you, damn you!... Your good health, Grannie.

MARTHA [returns and stands at the table pouring out tea].

MICHAEL. That's right. Fancy taking offence! I say, it's thanks to him.
[To Tramp] What do you think? [Embraces Martha] I cherish my old woman.
See, how I cherish her. In a word, my old woman is first-rate. I would
not change her for anybody.

IGNÁT. There, that's good. Grannie, drink! I stand treat.

TRAMP. What it means--the power of enershy! One was in a state of
melancholy, and now there's nothing but pleasantness and friendly
disposition. Grannie, I feel much love for you and for everybody.
Brothers dear [sings revolutionary song].

MICHAEL. It has got right hold of him in his hunger.




ACT II

    Same hut. Morning

    Martha and Akulína. Michael is asleep


MARTHA [takes hatchet] I must go and chop some firewood.

AKULÍNA [with a pail] He'd have beaten you black and blue yesterday, had
it not been for that fellow. I don't see him. Has he gone? I suppose he
has. [Exit one after the other].

MICHAEL [climbs down from the top of the oven] Just look, the sun's
already quite high. [Puts on his boots] She must have gone to fetch
water with mother. How my head aches! I won't do it again; the devil
take it! [Crosses himself before the icon, prays, and then washes his
hands and face] I'll go and harness.

    Enter Martha with firewood.

MARTHA. And yesterday's beggar? Has he gone?

MICHAEL. Must have gone. Can't see him.

MARTHA. Oh well, let him go. He seemed a clever chap though.

MICHAEL. He took your part!

MARTHA. What of that!

    Michael puts on his coat.

MARTHA. And the tea and sugar? Did you put them away last night, eh?

MICHAEL. I thought you did.

    Enter Akulína with a pail of water.

MARTHA [to Akulína] Mother, have you taken the parcel?

AKULÍNA. No, I know nothing about it. I haven't seen it.

MARTHA. Last night, I put it on the window-sill.

AKULÍNA. Yes, I saw it there.

MARTHA. Where can it be? [They look for it].

AKULÍNA. Dear me, what a shame!

    Enter Neighbour.

NEIGHBOUR. Well Michael Tikhónych, are we to go for the wood?

MICHAEL. Yes, of course. I'm just going to harness; but you see we've
lost something.

NEIGHBOUR. Dear me! What is it?

MARTHA. Why, you see, my old man brought a parcel from town yesterday,
with tea and sugar in it, and I put it down here on the window-sill and
didn't remember to put it away; and now it's gone.

MICHAEL. And we're committing the sin of suspecting a tramp who spent
the night here.

NEIGHBOUR. What sort of tramp?

MARTHA. Well, he's rather thin and has no beard.

MICHAEL. His coat's all in rags.

NEIGHBOUR. Curly hair and rather hooked nose?

MICHAEL. Yes, yes!

NEIGHBOUR. I've just met him, and wondered why he was stepping out so
fast.

MICHAEL. It must be him. Where was he?

NEIGHBOUR. I don't think he can have crossed the bridge yet.

MICHAEL [snatches up his cap and goes out quickly, followed by the
Neighbour] I'll catch the knave. It's him.

MARTHA. Oh, what a shame, what a shame! It's surely him.

AKULÍNA. And suppose it's not. It happened once, some twenty years ago,
that they accused a man of having stolen a horse. A crowd collected. One
says: "I myself saw him catching it." Another says he saw him leading
it. It was a big piebald horse, easily noticed. All the people began
searching for it, and in the forest they found the lad. "It's you," they
say. He protests and swears it was not him. They say: "What's the good
of listening to him; the women said quite certainly it's him." Then he
said something rude. George Lapúshkin (he's dead now) was a hot-tempered
man. He dashed at him slap bang, and struck him on the mouth. "It was
you," said he, and hit out at him. Then all the others fell on him and
began beating him with sticks and fists till they killed him. And what
do you think!.... Next day the real thief was found. The lad they killed
had only gone into the forest to choose a tree to cut down.

MARTHA. Yes, of course, we may be sinning against him. He has come down
very low, but seemed a good fellow.

AKULÍNA. Yes, he has sunk very low. One can't expect much from the likes
of him.

MARTHA. They're shouting. I expect they're bringing him back.

    Enter Michael, Neighbour, an old man and a lad, pushing the Tramp
    before them.

MICHAEL [with the parcel in his hands, excitedly to his wife] It was
found on him. [To Tramp] You thief! You dog!

AKULÍNA [to Martha] It's him, poor soul. See how he hangs his head.

MARTHA. It seems it was himself he spoke about yesterday that grabs
anything that's handy when he's had some drink.

TRAMP. I'm not a thief; I'm an expropriator. I am a worker and must
live. You can't understand it. Do what you like with me.

NEIGHBOUR. Take him to the village Elder or straight to the police!

TRAMP. I tell you, do whatever you like. I am not afraid, and am ready
to suffer for my convictions. If you were educated you would understand.

MARTHA [to her husband] Suppose we let him go, in God's name. We've got
the parcel back. Let him go and let's not commit another sin.

MICHAEL [repeating] "Another sin!" Taken to teaching? One wouldn't know
what to do without you, eh?

MARTHA. Why not let him go?

MICHAEL. "Let him go!" One knows what to do without you, you fool. "Let
him go!" Go he may, but he must hear a word or two so that he should
feel. [To Tramp] Well then, listen, you sir, to what I have to say to
you. Though you are in a very low state, still you have done very
wrong--very wrong. Another man would have caved your ribs in, and have
taken you to the police; but I will only say this. You've done wrong, as
wrong as may be; only you are in a very bad way and I don't want to hurt
you. [Pauses. Everyone is silent. Then he continues solemnly] Go, and
God be with you, and do not do it again. [Looks at his wife] And you
want to teach me!

NEIGHBOUR. You shouldn't, Michael; oh, you should not. You're
encouraging that sort of thing.

MICHAEL [the parcel still in his hand] Whether I should or not is my
business. [To his wife] And you tried to teach me! [Stops, looks at the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

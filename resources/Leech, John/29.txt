EDITOR'S NOTE

[Illustration]

From his earliest days MR. PUNCH has been an enthusiast for the Hunting
Field. But in this he has only been the faithful recorder of the manners
of his countrymen, as there is no sport more redolent of "Merrie
England" than that of the Horse and Hound. At no time in MR. PUNCH'S
history has he been without an artist who has specialised in the humours
of the hunt. First it was the inimitable Leech, some of whose drawings
find a place in the present collection, and then the mantle of the
sporting artist would seem to have descended to feminine shoulders, as
Miss Bowers (Mrs. Bowers-Edwards) wore it for some ten years after 1866.
That lady is also represented in the present work, at pages 49 and 111.
Later came Mr. G. H. Jalland, many of whose drawings we have chosen for
inclusion here. Perhaps the most popular of his hunting jokes was that
of the Frenchman exclaiming, "Stop ze chasse! I tomble, I faloff! _Stop
ze fox!!!_" (see page 141). To-day, of course, it is Mr. G. D. Armour
whose pencil is devoted chiefly to illustrating the humorous side of
hunting; but now, as formerly, most of the eminent artists whose work
lies usually in other fields, delight at times to find a subject
associated with the hunt. Thus we are able to present examples of Mr.
Cecil Aldin and Mr. Raven-Hill in sportive mood, while such celebrities
of the past as Randolph Caldecott and Phil May are here drawn upon for
the enriching of this, the first book of hunting humour compiled from
the abundant chronicles of MR. PUNCH.

THE HUNTING SEASON

(_By Jorrocks Junior_)

    The season for hunting I see has begun,
    So adieu for a time to my rod and my gun;
    And ho! for the fox, be he wild or in bag,
    As I follow the chase on my high-mettled nag.

[Illustration: "WEATHER PERMITTING,"--MR. PUNCH DRIVES TO THE FIRST
MEET.]

       *       *       *       *       *

    I call him high-mettled, but still I must state,
    He hasn't a habit I always did hate,
    He doesn't walk sideways, like some "gees" you meet,
    Who go slantindicularly down the street.

    He's steady and well broken in, for, of course,
    I can't risk my life on an unbroken horse;
    You might tie a torpedo or two on behind,
    And though they exploded that horse wouldn't mind.

    My strong point is costume, and oft I confess
    I've admired my get-up in a sportsmanlike dress;
    Though, but for the finish their lustre confers,
    I would much rather be, I declare, without spurs.

    They look very well as to cover you ride,
    But I can't keep the things from the animal's side;
    And the mildest of "gees," I am telling no fibs,
    Will resent having liberties ta'en with his ribs.

    Then hie to the cover, the dogs are all there,
    And the horn of the hunter is heard on the air;
    I've a horn of my own, which in secret I stow,
    For, oddly enough, they don't like me to blow.

    We'll go round by that gate, my good sir, if you please,
    I'm one of your sportsmen who rides at his ease;
    And I don't care to trouble my courser to jump,
    For whenever he does I fall off in a lump.

    Then haste to the meet! The Old Berkeley shall find,
    If I don't go precisely as fast as the wind,
    If they'll give my Bucephalus time to take breath,
    We shall both of us, sometimes, be in at the death!

PROVERBS FOR THE TIMID HUNTSMAN

_Dressing_

There's no toe without a corn.

If the boot pinches--bear it.

_Breakfast_

A snack in time, saves nine.

Faint hunger never conquered tough beef-steak.

_Mounting_

You can't make a hunter out of a hired hack.

The nearer the ground the safer the seat.

_In the Field_

Take care of the hounds, but the fence may take care of itself.

Too many brooks spoil the sport.

One pair of spurs may bring a horse to the water, but twenty will not
make him jump.

It is the howl that shows the funk.

Fools break rails for wise men to go over.

Snobs and their saddles are soon parted.

_At Luncheon_

A flask in the hand is worth a cask in the vault.

Cut your sandwiches according to your stomach.

_Coming Home_

The nearer the home, the harder the seat.

_Bed-time_

It's a heavy sleep that has no turning.

DIARY OF THE MODERN HUNT SECRETARY

     "Capping all non-subscribers is pretty generally resorted to, this
     season, not only in the shires, but also with provincial
     packs."--_Daily Press._]

_Monday._--Splendid gallop after non-subscriber. Spotted the quarry on
good-looking chestnut, whilst we were drawing big covert. Edged my horse
over in his direction, but non-subscriber very wary--think he must have
known my face as "collector of tolls." Retired again to far side of
spinney and disguised myself in pair of false whiskers, which I always
keep for these occasions. Craftily sidled up, and finally got within
speaking distance, under cover of the whiskers, which effectually masked
my battery. "Beg pardon, sir," I began, lifting my hat, "but I don't
think I have the pleasure of knowing your name as a subscri----" But he
was off like a shot. Went away over a nice line of country, all grass,
and a good sound take-off to most of the fences. Non-subscriber had got
away with about a three lengths lead of me, and that interval was fairly
maintained for the first mile and a half of the race. Then, felt most
annoyed to see that my quarry somewhat gained on me as we left the
pasture land and went across a holding piece of plough. Over a stiff
post and rails, and on again, across some light fallow, towards a big
dry ditch. The hunted one put his horse resolutely at it--must say he
rode very straight, but what _won't_ men do to avoid "parting?"--horse
jumped short and disappeared from view together with his rider. Next
moment I had also come a cropper at ditch, and rolled down on top of my
prey. "Excuse me," I said, taking out my pocket-book and struggling to
my knees in six inches of mud, "but when you rather abruptly started
away from covertside, I was just about to remark that I did not think
you were a subscriber, and that I should have much pleasure in taking
the customary 'cap'--thank you." And he paid up quite meekly. We agreed,
as we rode back together, in the direction in which we imagined hounds
to be, that even if they had got away with a good fox, the field would
not be likely to have had so smart a gallop as he and I had already
enjoyed. Lost my day's hunting, of course.

_Thursday._--Got away after another non-subscriber, led him over four
fields, after which he ran me out of sight. Lost my day's hunting again,
but was highly commended by M.F.H. for my zeal.

_Saturday._--M.F.H. pointed out five non-subscribers, and I at once
started off to "cap" them. Lost another day with hounds--shall send in
my resignation.

Air--"_The Hunting Day_"

      "What a fine hunting day"--
      'Tis an old-fashioned lay
    That I'll change to an up-to-date pome;
      Old stagers may swear
      That the pace isn't fair,
    But they're left far behind us at home!
    See cyclists and bikes on their way,
    And scorchers their prowess display;
      Let us join the glad throng
      That goes wheeling along,
    And we'll all go a-hunting to-day!

      New Nimrods exclaim,
      "Timber-topping" is tame,
    And "bull-finches" simply child's play;
      And they don't care a jot
      For a gallop or trot,
    Though they _will_ go a-hunting to-day.
    There's a fox made of clockwork, they say
    They'll wind him and get him away;
      He runs with a rush
      On rails with his brush,
    So we must go and chase him to-day.

      We've abolished the sounds
      Of the horn and the hounds--
    'Tis the bicycle squeaker that squeals
      And the pack has been stuffed,
      Or sent to old Cruft,
    Now the huntsmen have taken to wheels!
    Hairy country no more we essay,
    Five bars, too, no longer dismay,
      For we stick to the roads
      In the latest of modes,
    So we'll bike after Reynard to-day!

MY LITTLE BROWN MARE

(_A Song for the commencement of the Hunting Season_)

    She's rather too lean but her head's a large size,
    And she hasn't the average number of eyes;
    Her hind legs are not what you'd call a good pair,
    And she's broken both knees, has my little brown mare.

    You can find some amusement in counting each rib,
    And she bites when she's hungry like mad at her crib;
    When viewed from behind she seems all on the square,
    She's quite a Freemason--my little brown mare.

    Her paces are rather too fast, I suppose,
    For she often comes down on her fine Roman nose,
    And the way she takes fences makes hunting men stare,
    For she backs through the gaps does my little brown mare.

    She has curbs on her hocks and no hair on her knees;
    She has splints and has spavins wherever you please?
    Her neck, like a vulture's, is horribly bare,
    But still she's a beauty, my little brown mare.

    She owns an aversion to windmills and ricks,
    When passing a waggon she lies down and kicks;
    And the clothes of her groom she'll persistently tear--
    But still she's no vice has my little brown mare.

    When turned down to grass she oft strays out of bounds;
    She always was famous for snapping at hounds;
    And even the baby has learnt to beware
    The too playful bite of my little brown mare.

    She prances like mad and she jumps like a flea,
    And her waltz to a brass band is something to see:
    No circus had ever a horse, I declare,
    That could go through the hoops like my little brown mare.

    I mount her but seldom--in fact, to be plain,
    Like the Frenchman, when hunting I "do not remain:"
    Since I've only one neck it would hardly be fair
    To risk it in riding my little brown mare!

A Nice Prospect

_Host_ (_to Perks, an indifferent horseman, who has come down for the
hunting_). "Now, look here, Perks, old chap, as you're a light weight,
I'll get you to ride this young mare of mine. You see, I want to get her
qualified for our Hunt Cup, and she's not up to my weight, or I'd ride
her myself. Perhaps I'd better tell you she hasn't been ridden to hounds
before, so she's sure to be a bit nervous at first; and mind you steady
her at the jumps, as she's apt to rush them; and I wouldn't take her too
near other people, as she has a nasty temper, and knows how to use her
heels; and, whatever you do, don't let her get you down, or she'll tear
you to pieces. The last man that rode her is in hospital now. But keep

    O MOLLY, dear, my head, I fear, is going round and round,

    Though he dances like a steam-engine, as all the world may see;

    As he plunges down the ball-room, taking couples in his stride.
    'Tis a cropper you'll be coming, but you know your business best,
    Still, it's bad to see you romping round with Charlie and the rest;
    Now you're dancing with Lord Arthur--sure, he's had enough to dhrink--
    And I'm "hanging" all your partners for the wearing of the pink!
    Your cruelty ashamed you'll be someday to call to mind,
    You'll be glad to ask my pardon, then, for being so unkind,
    The hunting men are first, to-night--well, let them have their whack--
    You'll be glad to dance with me, someday--when all the coats are black!
    But, since pink's the only colour now that fills your pretty head,
    Bedad, I'll have some supper, and then vanish home to bed.

HUNTING EXTRAORDINARY

Jobson, who edits a cheerful little weekly, said to me the other day:

"You hunt, don't you?"

I looked at him knowingly. Jobson interpreted my smile according to his
preconceived idea.

"I thought so," he continued.

"Well, you might do me a bright little article--about half a column, you
know--on hunting, will you?"

Why should I hesitate? Jobson is safe for cash; and he had not asked me
to give my own experiences of the hunting field. I replied warily, "I
fancy I know the sort of thing you want."

"Good," he said, and before we could arrive at any detailed explanation
he had banged the door and dashed downstairs, jumped into his hansom and
was off.

This was the article:-

THOUGHTS ON HUNTING.

It is hardly possible to overrate the value of hunting as a National
sport. Steeplechasing is a Grand-National sport, but it is the sport of
the rich, whereas hunting is not. By judiciously dodging the Hunt
Secretary, you can, in fact, hunt for nothing. Of course, people will
come at me open-mouthed for this assertion, and say, "How about the keep
of your horses?" To which I reply, "If you keep a carriage, hunt the
carriage horse; if you don't, borrow a friend's horse for a long ride in
the country, and accidentally meet the hounds." To proceed. This has
been a season of poor scent. Of course, the horses of the present day
have deteriorated as line hunters: they possess not the keen sense of
smell which their grandsires had. But despite this the sport goes gaily
on. There are plenty of foxes--but we cannot agree with the popular idea
of feeding them on poultry. And yet, in every hunt, we see hunters
subscribing to poultry funds. This is not as it should be: Spott's meat
biscuit would be much better for foxes' food.

But these be details: let us hie forrard and listen to the cheery voice
of sly Reynard as he is winded from his earth. The huntsman blows his
horn, and soon the welkin rings with a chorus of brass instruments; the
tufters dash into covert, and anon the cheerful note of _Ponto_ or
_Gripper_ gives warning that a warrantable fox is on foot--well, of
course, he couldn't be on horseback, but this is merely a venatorial
_façon de parler_. Away go the huntsmen, showing marvellous dexterity in
cracking their whips and blowing their horns at the same moment. Last of
all come the hounds, trailing after their masters--ah, good dogs, you
cannot hope to keep up very far with the swifter-footed horses!
Nevertheless, they strain at their leashes and struggle for a better
place at the horses' heels. "Hike forrard! tally ho! whoo-hoop!" They
swoop over the fields like a charge of cavalry. But after several hours'
hard running a check is at hand: the fox falters, then struggles on
again, its tail waving over its head. As its pursuers approach, it
rushes up a tree to sit on the topmost branch and crack nuts.

The panting horses arrive--some with their riders still in the saddle,
though many, alas! have fallen by the wayside. Next come the hounds, at
a long interval--poor _Fido_, poor _Vic_, poor _Snap_! you have done
your best to keep up, but the horses have out-distanced you! The
whipper-in immediately climbs the tree in which the little red-brown
animal still peacefully cracks its nuts, its pretty tail curled well
over its head. Its would-be captor carries a revolving wire cage, and,
by sleight-of-hand movement, manages to get the quarry securely into it.
Then he descends, places the cage in a cart and it is driven home.

The "mort" is sounded by four green velvet-coated huntsmen, with horns
wound round their bodies; a beautiful brush presented to the lady who
was first up at the "take"; and then the field slowly disperse. Tally
Ho-Yoicks! all is over for the day.

OUR HUNT "POINT TO POINT"

Last week our Point to Point steeplechase came off. So did several of
the riders: this merely _par parenthèse_. I offered to mark out the
course, and, as I intended to escape the dread ordeal of riding by
scratching my horse at the last moment, I thought it would be great fun
to choose a very stiff, not to say bloodthirsty, line. Awful grumbling
on the part of those unhappy ones who were to ride. Just as the bell
rang for saddling, Captain Sproozer, ready dressed for the fray, came up
to me with very long face, and said, "Beastly line this, you know,
Phunker. I call it much too stiff."

I smiled in pitying and superior manner. "Think so, my dear Sproozer? My
horse can't run, worse luck, but I only wish _I_ were going to have the
gallop over it."

"So you shall, then!" cried a rasping voice, suddenly, from behind me.
Sir Hercules Blizzard was the speaker, an awful man with an awful
temper. "So you shall. My idiot of a jockey broke his collar-bone trying
to jump one of the fences on this confounded course of yours to-day, so,
as I am without a rider, you shall ride my mare Dinah."

Swallowed lump in my throat as I thanked him for his offer, but thought
I had better decline, as I didn't know the mare, and besides that, I----

"Oh! all right, I know what you are going to say: that you're not much
good on a horse"--(nothing of the sort! I was not going to say any such
thing, confound the man!) "Of course, I know all that, and that you're
not much of a rider; but I can't help myself now. It's too late to get a
decent horseman, so I shall have to make shift with you."

Deuced condescending of him. I made a feeble effort to escape, and would
cheerfully have paid a hundred pounds for the chance of doing so. Phil
Poundaway, great friend of mine, came up and said (sympathetically, as I
thought at first), "I should think you'd prefer to get off it, wouldn't
you, Phunker?"

Thought he would volunteer in my place, so was perfectly frank with him.
"My dear Phil, I'd give a hundred to get off----"

"Ah! you will, I expect, at the first fence, without paying the money!"
he grinned, as he turned away.

Murder was in my heart at that moment. I got on Dinah, and, feeling like
death, rode down to the starting-post. Thoughts of a misspent youth, of
home and friends and things, came o'er me. I seemed once more to see the
little rose-covered porch, the----

"What on earth are you mooning about?" thundered the Blizzardian voice
in my ear. "Take hold of her head tighter than that, or you'll be off!"

The next moment the starter yelled "Go!" and away, like a whirlwind, we
sped across the first field, towards a huge, thick blackthorn fence, the
one I had thought to see such fun with. Fun! I never felt less funny in
my life, as we approached it at the rate of two thousand miles an hour!
The mare jumped high, but I jumped much higher, and seemed for a brief
moment to be soaring through the blue empyrean. Somehow, the mare
managed to evade me on the return journey earthwards, and, instead of
alighting on the saddle, I found myself "sitting on the floor." A
howl--it might have been of sympathy, but it didn't sound quite like
that--arose from the crowd, and then I thought that I would go home on
foot, instead of returning to explain matters to Sir Hercules. As a
matter of fact, I don't much care for associating with old Blizzard, at
all events, not just now.

THE END OF THE HUNTING SEASON

(_By Our Own Novice_)

    Good-bye to the season! E'en gluttons
      Have had quite enough of the game,
    And if we returned to our muttons,
      Our horses are laid up and lame.
    We hunted straight on through the winter,
      And never were stopped by the frost,
    As I know right well from each splinter
      Of bone that my poor limbs have lost.

    Good-bye to the season! The "croppers"
      I got where the fences were tall,
    And Oh the immaculate "toppers"
      That always were crushed by my fall.
    Don't think though that I'm so stout-hearted
      As e'er to jump hedges or dikes,
    It's simply that after we've started,
      My "gee" gallivants as it likes.

    In vain I put on natty breeches,
      And tops like Meltonian swell,
    It ends in the blessed old ditches,
      I know like the Clubs in Pall Mall.

    And when from a "gee" that's unruly
      I fall with a terrible jar,
    I know that old _Jorrocks_ spoke truly,
      And hunting's "the image of war."

    And never for me "_Fair Diana_"
      Shall smile as we know that she can,
    With looks that are sweeter than manna,
      On many a fortunate man.
    It adds to the pangs that I suffer,
      When thrown at a fence in her track,
    To hear her "Ridiculous duffer!"
      When jumping slap over my back.

    I've fractured my ulnar, I'm aching
      Where over my ribs my horse rolled;
    Egad! the "Old Berkeley" is making
      One man feel uncommonly old.
    Good-bye to the season! I'm shattered
      And damaged in figure and face;
    But thankful to find I'm not scattered
      In pieces all over the place!

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

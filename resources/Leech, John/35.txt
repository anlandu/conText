PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

|The custom of inditing a preface is one which is perhaps more honoured
in the breach than in the observance: nevertheless, I cannot allow the
present opportunity to pass without returning my hearty thanks and
acknowledgments to my Critics, and the Press generally, for the
indulgent consideration I have received at their hands, and for the
discriminating advice, of which, in revising this edition, I have gladly
availed myself. Many of the minor pieces-introduced in the first
instance principally as vehicles for illustrations have been omitted,
and others of a somewhat less trivial character substituted.

These alterations have, to a certain extent, modified the original
design of the book, as conveyed by its title; but the unexpectedly
flattering reception accorded to the two most serious poems, the "Night
Mail North," and the "Derby Day," (the former haying been quoted at
length in nine Reviews) led me to think that the change might not be
disadvantageous.

I have had on the whole but few hard knocks to complain of; certainly
fewer than, considering the nature of some of the poems, I had reason to
expect. For these adverse criticisms, which were no doubt the expression
of the genuine opinions of their writers, I bear no grudge. As the
Author of "The Season" pointedly phrases it, I could "have escaped
censure only by escaping notice."

          OW then, take your seats! for Glasgow

                             and the North;

                   Chester!--Carlisle!--Holyhead,

                        and the wild Frith of Forth.

                   Clap on the steam, and sharp's

                             the word

                   "You men in scarlet cloth:--

                   "Are there any more passengers,

                        For the Night.. Mail.. to the North!"

                   Are there any more passengers?

               Yes three-but they can't get in,

          Too late, too late!-How they bellow and knock,

               They might as well try to soften a rock

               As the heart of that fellow in green.

               For the Night Mail North? what Ho--

                   My young and lusty one--

                   "And the double-barrell'd gun!"

               For the Night Mail North, I say?--

                   You with the eager eyes--

               You with the haggard face and pale?--

               'From a ruin'd hearth and a starving brood,

                   "A crime and a felon's gaol!"

               For the Night Mail North, old man?--

                   Old statue of despair--

               Why tug and strain at the iron gate?

               "My daughter!!" Ha! too late, too late,

               She is gone, you may safely swear;

               She has given you the slip, d'you hear?

               She has left you alone in your wrath,--

               And she's off and away, with a glorious start,

          To the home of her choice, with the man of her heart,

                   By the Night Mail North!

               A desp'rate man whom none may withstand,

          For look, there is something clench'd in his hand---

                   Tho' the bearer is ready to drop---

                   He waves it wildly to and fro,

               And hark! how the crowd are shouting below---

                             "Back!"---

               And back the opposing barriers go,

               The Guard has caught the flutt'ring sheet,

               Now forward and northward! fierce and fleet,

          Thro' the mist and the dark and the driving sleet,

                   As if life and death were in it;

               'Tis a splendid race! a race against Time,---

                   And a thousand to one we win it.

                   Look at those flitting ghosts---

                   The white-arm'd finger posts---

               If we're moving the eighth of an inch, I say,

                   We're going a mile a minute!


                   A mile a minute--for life or death---

               Away, away! though it catches one's breath,

                   The man shall not die in his wrath:

               The quivering carriages rock and reel---

          Hurrah! for the rush of the grinding steel!

          The thundering crank, and the mighty wheel!--

                   Are there any more pasengers

               For the Night.. Mail.. to the North?

SONG OF IN-THE-WATER.


(By L--g--f--R.)

[Illustration: 9029]


               HEN the summer night

                             descended

               Sleepy on the White--

                        Witch water;

                   Came a lithe and lovely

                             maiden,

                   Gazing on the silent water--

                        Gazing on the gleaming river--

                   With her azure eyes and tender,--

               On the river, glancing forward,

               Till the laughing waves sprang upward,

               Dancing in her smile of sunshine

                   Curling ev'ry dimpled ripple

               As they sprang into the starlight;

               As they clasp'd her charm'd reflection

                   Glowing to their silver bosoms--

               As they whisper'd, "Fairest, fairest,

                   "Rest upon our crystal bosoms!"


          And she straightway did according:--

               Down into the water stept she,

               Down into the shining river,

               Like a red deer in the sunset--

               Like a ripe leaf in the autumn:

          From her lips like roses snow-fill'd,

                   Came a soft and dreamy murmur.

                   Softer than the breath of summer.

                   Softer than the murmring river!

               Sighs that melted as the snows melt.

                   Silently and sweetly melted;

               Words that mingled with the crisping

                   Foam upon the billow resting.


                   From the forest shade primeval,

               Piggey-Wiggey look'd out at her;

                   He, the very Youthful Porker--

                        He, the Everlasting Granter--

               Gazed upon her there, and wonder'd!

               With his nose out, rokey-pokey--

               And his tail up, curley-wurley--

          Wonder'd what on earth the row meant.

               Wonder'd what the girl was up to--

          What the deuce her little game was?


               And she floated down the river,

                   Like a water-proof Ophelia--

               For her crinoline sustained her!!

THE FIGHT FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.


By L --d  M--l-- y.

TOLD BY AN ANCIENT GLADIATOR TO HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER.


I.

[Illustration: 9033]


          ARGE Heenan of Benicia,

                   By ninety-nine gods he

                             swore,

                   That the bright Belt of

                             England

                   Should grace her sons

                             no more.


                        By ninety-nine he swore it,

                   And named the "fisting" day.--

                   East and west and south and north

               Sir Richard Mayne rode wildly forth

                   His cohorts to array!



II.


               East and west and south and north

                   The smart Detectives flew--

               South and north and east and west

                   They watch'd the long day thro'.

               West and south--east and north--

                   The word went flashing by,

               "Look out for Sayers and Heenan,

                   "Policemen--mind your eye!"


III.


                   Sir Robert's azure heroes

                        Look'd out uncommon keen,

                   From park and plain and prairie,

                        From heath and upland green;

               From Essex fens and fallows,

                   From Hampshire--dale and down--

               From Sussex' hundred leagues of sand,

               To Shropshire's fat and flow'ry land

               And Cheshire's wild and wasted strand,

                   And Yorkshire's heather brown;--

               And so, of course, the fight came off

               A dozen miles from Town.

IV.


               Then first stept out great Heenan,

                   Unmatch'd for breadth and length;

               And in his chest it might be guess'd,

                   He had unpleasant strength.

               And to him went the Sayers

                   That look'd both small and thin,

               But well each practised eye could read

               The Lion and the Bull-dog breed,--

               And from each fearless stander-by

               Arose that genuine British cry,

                   "Go in, my boy,--and win!"

V.


               And he "went in"--and smote him

                   Through mouth-piece and through cheek;

               And Heenan smote him back again

                   Into the ensuing week;

               Full seven days thence he smote him

                   With one prodigious crack,

               And th' undaunted Champion straight

               Discern'd that he was five feet eight,

                   When flat upon his back:--

               Whilst a great shout of laughter

                   Rang from the Yankee pack.

VI.


               As springs the Whitworth bullet

                   Out sprang the Champion then,

               And dealt the huge Benician

                   A vast thump on the chin;

               And thrice and four times strongly

                   Drove in the shatt'ring blow;

               And thrice and four times waver'd

                   The herculean foe;

               And his great arms swung wildly,

                   Like ship-masts, to and fro.

VII.


               But now no sound of laughter

                   Was heard on either side,

               Whilst feint, and draw, and rally,

                   The cautious Bruisers tried;

               And long they spared and counter'd,

                   Till Heenan sped a thrust

               So fierce and quick, it swept away

               Th' opposing guard like sapling spray,--

               And for the second time that day

                   The Champion bit the dust.

VIII.

Short time lay English Sayers
Upon the ground at length,
Short time his Yankee foeman
Had triumph in his strength;
Bight to the eye he smote him
And his soul went with the blow--
Such blow no other hand could dash
Such blow no other arm could smash--
The giant tottered low;
And for a space they spong'd his face,
And thought the eye would go.

IX.


               Time's up!--Again they battle;

                   Again the strokes" fly free;

               But Sayers' right arm--that arm of pride--

               Now dangles pow'rless by his side,

                   Plain for all eyes to see;

               And thro' that long and desp'rate shock--

               Two mortal hours on the clock--

               By sheer indomitable pluck

                   With his _left hand_ fought he!

X.


               With his left hand he fought him,

                   Though he was sore in pain,--

               Full twenty times hurl'd backward,

                   Still pressing on again!

               With his left hand he fought him,

                   Till each could fight no more;

               Till Sayers could scarcely strike a blow,

               Till Heenan could not see his foe--

               Such fighting England never knew

                   Upon her soil before!

XI.


               They gave him of the standard

                   Gold coinage of the realm,

               As much as one stout guardsman

                   Could carry in his helm;

               They made him an ovation

                   On the Exchange hard by,--

               And they may slap their pockets

                   In witness if I lie.

XII.


               And ev'ry soul in England

                   Was glad, both high and low,

               And books were voted snobbish,

                   And "gloves" were all the go;

               And each man told the story,

                   Whilst ladies' hearts did melt,

               How Sayers, the British Champion,

                   Did battle for the Belt.

XIII.


               And still, when Yankees swagger

                   Th' almighty "stars and stripes,"

               And put eternal bunkum

                   Into their neighbours' pipes,--

               With joke and gibe and banter

                   Long shall the tale be told,

               How stout Tom Sayers kept the Belt

                   And Yankee Doodle sold!

               Thou hast a gentle wife at home?

                   A son--perchance like me--

               And children fair with golden hair

                   To cling around thy knee?

               Then by their love I pray thee,

                   And by their merry tone;

               By home, and all its tender joys,

                   Which I have never known,--

               By all the smiles that hail thee now;

                   By ev'ry former sigh;

               By ev'ry pang that thou hast felt

                   When lone, perchance, as I,--

               By youth and all its blossoms bright,

                   By manhood's ripen'd fruits,

'THE POET CLOSE.'

               CH! botheration! what a perturbation

                   And exasperation in the Press arose,

               At the first mintion of the Queen's intintion

                   To confer a pinsion on the Poet Close!

          There was the True-Blues-Man and the Farthing--

                             Newsman

                   All in the confushan fighting cheek by jowl;

               And the Whigs and Tories forgett'n their furies

                   In their indignation and giniral howl!


               The _TittlerTattle_ and the _Penny-Rattle_

                   Led off the battle with a puny squake,

               Whilst the _Big-Tin-Kettle_ and the 'heavy metal'

               His hash for to settle took the liberty to spake;--


               "Shure'twas most ongracious, not to say owdacious,

                   And enough to bring the water to their eyes,

               To take the loaves and fishes from the chilthren's dishes

                   And bestow the Royal Bounty in such wise.


               "If so be that noble Er-rls and infarior chur-rls

               Let them squeeze their purses to choke off the curses

                   And not foist their verses on the Public State!

               'Twas worse than jobbery, and a right down robbery,

                   For to give the ruffian fifty pounds a year,--

               Becase the swate nobilities were dhreading his civilities,

                   And ould Lord Lonsdale in a state of bodily fear.


               "Themselves despiting, there was Carlisle writing,

                   And Brougham inditing of saft-sardering notes,

               And Viscount Palmerston a-chuckling at the harm he's

                             done,

                   And dipping his fingers in the county votes.--

               'Twould be a wrong entirely, to be remimber'd direly,

                   If the scribbling blackguard on 'the List' was placed,

                   Then for sartin shure the counthry was disgraced!"


               So the papers thunder'd, and the people wonder'd

                   _Whose_ nose had blunder'd into this hornet's nist;

               And the Queen, Heav'n bless her! the Roy'1 Rehdresser,

                   Struck Close's name out of the Civil List

               Och! then, what a rowing and a rubadub-dow-ing

                   And universal crowing fill'd the air,

               With a gin'ral hissing,--but Lord Pam was missing,

                   And making for the house-top by the garret-stair!

               All day long that injured party

               Nightly several score of lions

                   Yielded up their worthless lives;

                   Hairless underneath his hat,

               Shot, and bagg'd, the fierce Gorilla,

                   Ha! that's the Favourite--look at his,

                        It suggests the idea of wings:

                   And the glossy neck is arched and firm

                        In spite of the flying pace;

                   The jockey sticks to his back like glue,

               And his hand is quick and his eye is true,

                   And whatever skill and pluck can do

                   They will do to win the race.

               The colt with the bright broad chest,

                   Will run to win to day--

          There's fame and fortune in every bound

          And a hundred and fifty thousand pound

                   Staked on the gallant Bay!

                        "_Theyre off!_"....

                   And away at the very first start,

                   "Hats down! hats down in front!

               "Hats down, you sir in the wide-awake!"--

               The tighten'd barriers quiver and shake

                   But they bravely bear the brunt.

               A hush, like death, is over the crowd;

                   D'you hear that distant cry?--

               Then hark how it gathers, far and near,

                   One rolling, ringing, rattling cheer

                        As the race goes dashing by,

               And away with the hats and caps in the air,

                   And the horses seem to fly...

               Forward! forward! at railway speed,

               There's one that has fairly taken the lead

                   In a style that can scarce miscarry;

                   Oyer and on, like a flash of light,

               And now his colours are coming in sight,

               Favourite! Favourite!--scarlet and white--

                   He'll win, by the Lord Harry!!

               If he can but clear the Corner, I say,

                   The Derby is lost and won--

                   It's an awful shave, but he'll do the trick,

               Now! Now or never--he's passing it quick.--

                             _He's round!_...

               No, he isn't; he's broken his neck,

                   And the jockey his collar bone:

               And the whirlwind race is over his head,

          Without stopping to ask if he's living or dead,--

               Was there ever such rudeness known?

          He fell like a trump in the foremost place--

          He died with the rushing wind on his face--

          At the wildest bound of his glorious pace--

                   In the mad exulting revel;

                   He left his shoes to his son and heir,

               His hocks to a champagne dealer at Ware,

                        A lock of his hair

                   To the Lady-Mare,

               And his hoofs and his tail------to the------!

HOW WE GOT TO THE BRIGHTON REBLEW

                   H, Brighton's the place

                        For a beautiful face,

               And a figure that gracefully made is;

                   And so far as I know

                   There's none other can show,

               At the right time of year--say November or so--

                   Such a bevy of pretty young ladies.


                   Such blows on the Down!

                   Such lounges thro' Town!

               Such a crush at Parade and Pavilion!


                        Such beaches below!

                        (Where people don't go),

               Such bathing!--Such dressing, past Madame Tussaud!--

                   No wonder it catches the Million!


                   For bustle and breeze

                   And a sniff of salt seas

               Oh, Brighton's the place!--not a doubt of it;--

                   But instead of post-chaise

               As we saunter'd slowly Eastward, with the weed between

               How we spied a damsel beauteous, lymphomatically

               Charley, you and I remember, on that bright fifth of

                        November,

               How she knelt there like a statue,--knelt bare-armëd

                        in the breeze,--

               Whist her saponaceous lavement catalambanized the

               And her virginal white vesture flutter'd, reef d-wise, to

                        the knees.


               Spell-bound in the road behind her, paused the Hurdy--

                        of tune.


               Then with her blue eyes entrancing, and her taper ankle

                        glancing,

               And her rounded arms akimbo resting on her dainty

                        waist;

               She half turn'd,--and turning threw me one glance

                        "utterly to undo me"--

               (Well, you know'twas me she look'd at, Charley, and

               Evermore my soul beguiling, in arch silence she kept

                        smiling--

               And my heart within my bosom, pretematurally hopp'd;

               Still as near I drew, and nearer, she grew fair and yet

                        more fairer (!)--

               On both knees upon the pavement (Miles's bags, my

                   well as I do?

               Till my Marianne consented, and we named the day at

               And while he gave his princely alms

                   He cursed the needy pauper.

                   Most probable to get to,

               Unless he preach'd in a scarlet cloak

               "His valued friends!"--and in his heart

                   He wished himself in Spain;--


               Of all spots in the world, he said,

                   To Jericho--or farther.


               And so he gave their right good health--

                   And off it went in toppers;

               And call'd them "Men and Patriots,"

                   And in his heart "Clodhoppers."--


               And then--with very blandest smiles--

                   From self and boon carousers,

               Gave prizes to some model louts,

                   "These best of merit's brandings,"--

               He thought "Was ever such a Calf

                   It had a monkey--in a trap--

                        Suspended by the tail:

                   Oh! but that monkey look'd distress'd,

                   Till he grew very mad:

               For his tail it was a handsome tail

                   And the trap had pinch'd it--bad.


               The trapper sat below, and grinn'd;

                   His victim's wrath wax'd hot:--

               He bit his tail--and fell--and kill'd

                   The trapper on the spot:--


                   It had a pig--a stately pig;

                        With curly tail and quaint:

                   And the Great Mogul had hold of that

                        Till he was like to faint.


                   So twenty thousand Chinamen;

                        With three tails each at least:

               Came up to help the Great Mogul

                   And took him round the waist.

               And so, the tail slipp'd through his hands;

                   Till he grew savage in his mind

                        And vex'd, above a bit--


                   And so, he swept his tail, as one

                        Awak'ning from a dream:

                   And those abominable ones

                   Flew off into the stream--


               And so, they hobbled up and down,

               Till they subsided--and became

                   Amongst the things that were:--


                   And so it had a moral too;

               A youth, who bore, in manual vice,

                        'X--X:' Haw haw!


               His brow was bad:--his young eye scann'd

               The frothing flaggon in his hand,

               And like a gurgling streamlet sprung

               The accents to that thirsty tongue,

                        X--X: Haw haw!


               In happy homes he saw them grub

               On stout, and oysters from a tub,--

               The dismal gas-lights gleam'd without,

               And from his lips escaped a shout,

                        "X--X: Haw haw!"

               When the brawny hands, that can rend an oak,

               And the feet that stand like the solid rock,

                   Were "tootsies pootsies, bless'em!"


               When to howl was the only accomplishment rife

               In our 'tight little bundle' of wailing and strife,

               And pap was the summum bonum of life,

               Its honey'd speeches, and hackney'd phrase,

               And more of sense in its bald little pate,

               On its own little matters of Church and State,

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS ON THE FIRST EDITION.


MORNING POST.

"'Puck on Pegasus' is at the same time the handsomest and cheapest book
of the kind that we have ever seen.... Puck, as he careers through the
world on his mad horse, shoots arrows of the pleasantest raillery,
dipped in Eau de Cologne rather than gall, at the follies of the season,
the artistic foibles of literary celebrities, and the affectations of
all classes, high and low. The wee, mocking urchin indites a sonnet in
the style of Martin Tupper, mimics Mrs. Browning, trills a song of _In-
the-water_ after the fashion of Longfellow; and, with the aid of a black
cat, stirs up 'a shocking sort of knocking at your chamber door,' that
reminds the beating heart of Edgar Poe. He induces Tennyson to write the
_Charge of the Light (Irish) Brigade_ and gives us a lay of _The Fight
for the Championship_ by Lord Macaulay. Some of the youngster's capers
are certainly unjustifiable; but extravagant mirth is never severely
judged when it expresses itself in easy running verses, the music of
which is as sweet as their rhymes are ingenious and unexpected.
Moreover, though Mr. Pennell's muse respects neither the age nor fame of
those whom he satirises, he never forgets gentlemanly con--sideration
for the feelings of his readers. A joke that would bring a blush to a
maiden's cheek, or a sarcasm aimed at the inoffensive, are not to be
found in his poems. Nor do we draw attention to the prevailing lightness
of his muse in a spirit of condemnation, but rather of regret that the
fine feeling and pathetic force manifested in the treatment of his two
finest pieces/ the _Night Mail North_, and the _Derby_ should have
inspired him less frequently than mere gaiety of heart.... The rhythm
and rugged swing of the _Night Mail North_, will give the reader a taste
of Mr. Pennell's higher qualities."


SATURDAY REVIEW.

"---- Mr. Pennell's parodies and imitations are certainly above the
average; they are at times, it is true, somewhat unequal, but there is a
good deal of vigorous and healthy versification scattered throughout the
volume."... "He has, moreover, studied with considerable advantage what
is vulgarly termed the art of 'selling,' more properly described as a
species of bathos. Barham, of the _Ingoldsby Legends_, as well as Hood
and Bon

Gualtier, excelled greatly in this. Such pieces usually give scope for
some pretty writing at their commencement, which the reader may accept
seriously or ironically as he should feel disposed. The absurdity or
satire is condensed generally into the last one or two lines. Mr.
Pennell's stanzas headed _Ah / Who_, are among his most neat and amusing
efforts of this character."... "No doubt the works of Hood have
exercised a con--siderable influence on Mr. Pennell's versification; and
in this school he may be fairly considered to have enrolled himself.

"The _Derby Day_ is one of the most spirited sketches in this volume.
The first three lines of our extract are excellent in their way, and
have a fine healthy _élan_ about them. The absence of the word 'trump'
would render them eligible for quotation in much higher poetical
company. The next verse, of a decidedly lower order, may still be given
as a very fair reproduction of Hood's peculiar style and humour. Our
author is telling how thé Derby favourite breaks his neck in the race:--



               'He fell like a trump in the foremost

                        place--

               He died with the rushing wind on his

                        face--

               At the wildest bound of his glorious

                        pace--


               In the mad exulting revel

               He left his shoes to his son and heir,

               His hocks to a champagne-dealer at Ware,

                   A lock of his hair

                   To the Lady-Mare,

               And his hoofs and his tail to the----!


"There are also to be found some prettyish bits of descriptive verse, of
which the following may be quoted, from the so-called song of
_In-the-Water_ with Longfellow's metre preserved:--

               Like a red deer in the sunset--

               Like a ripe leaf in the autumn!

                   Ever from her lips of coral,

               From her lips like roses snow-flll'd,

               Came a soft and dreamy murmur,

                   Softer than the murm'ring river!

               Sighs that melted as the snows melt,

                   Silently and sweetly melted.'


"We should advise Mr. Pennell, on the first available occasion, to
disem--barrass himself here of the stock-in-trade 'lips of coral.' This
passage would be materially improved by the omission. Again, in the
_Night Mail North_, our author seems at home in his subject, and writes
with considerable effect


               "Tis a splendid race I a race against

                        Time,--

               'The quivering carriages rock and reel,

               Hurrah! for the rush of the grinding

                        steel!

               And a thousand to one we win it.

                   Look at those flitting ghosts--

                   The thundering crank, and the mighty

                   The white-arm'd finger-posts-- wheel!--'


               If we're moving the eighth of an inch, Isay,

                   We're going a mile a minute!...'

"The last line but one is powerful enough, and the best in the extract.
There is plenty of poetry in railways and steam engines; and now that
other mines of inspiration are growing somewhat exhausted, we cannot see
why a new shaft should not be run in this direction. Many of our readers
may find, besides these extracts, much that is clever and amusing in
'Puck on Pegasus.'"

"To be funny without being vulgar, to tell a story with gestures and yet
not become a buffoon, to parody a poet and yet retain the flavour of his
real poetry, to turn all the finest feelings of the heart into fun, and
yet not to be coarse or unfeeling, is not granted by Apollo to every
writer of humorous poems."... "Mr. Pennell is an excellent parodyist, an
ingenious punster, a reviver and modifier of existing systems of fun, a
vigorous worker of veins of humour not yet carried for enough."... "Of
all the poems, we like best the _Night Mail North_, which has a singular
weird power about it that takes a hold on the imagination.... _Lord
Jolly Green's  Courtship_ is a well-written parody on a well-known poem
of Mrs. Browning. Next best is, perhaps, the _Sayers and Heenan Fight_,
a very vigorous imitation of Lord Macaulay's _Coman Ballads._ There is a
great rush and gallop about the _Derby Day_; the lines at the end are-
not unworthy of Hood's playful thoughtfulness."


EXAMINER.

"There is, without doubt, a good deal of humorous verse in this gaily
got up and cleverly illustrated volume.... But there are better things
than slang versides in Mr. Pennell's book, and more striking lines than
those which are printed in black letters. The _Derby Day_ offers a
favourable example of a popular subject well treated, in which the scene
is vividly and often poetically depicted. The _Fight for the
Championship_, written in imitation of Lord Macaulay's _Horatius_, is
also very well done.... The measure of the author's power may, however,
be taken from the poem emtitled _The Night Mail North_, one of the best
things the book contains..... Let Mr. Pennell trust to the original
strength that is in him, and he may bestride his 'Pegasus' without
fear."


FRASER'S MAGAZINE.

"When a gentleman means to be absurd, and at the same time can support
his pretensions to amuse his readers with cleverness, we know how to
accost him. 'Puck on Pegasus' is full of those eccentricities which make
one laugh in spite of oneself, or in unison with oneself, according as
one takes it up in a grave or a gay humour. It reminds one of the _Bon
Gaultier Ballads_ of some years ago.... The illustrations are capital,
as they were likely to be considering whose they are."


ILLUSTRATED NEWS OF THE WORLD.

"Mr. Pennell's 'Puck' is gay, rattling, and really clever, something in
the Bon Gaultier style... full of fun... very smart."


BELL'S LIFE.

"An admirable drawing-room table _brochure_, and is certain to have a
run."


ARMY AND NAYY GAZETTE.

"No one will be wearied with these verses.... We have seldom seen a book
more completely suitable to a drawing-room table. Mr. Pennell has
avoided Puck's sometimes offensive characteristic."

WELDON'S REGISTER.

"Mr. Pennell's 1 Puck on Pegasus' is one of the most amusing books of
verse that we have fallen in with for many a day."


MANCHESTER EXAMINER.

"... There is a high talent in _The Thread of Life_, showing that Mr.
Pennell can do much finer work whenever he may desire to soar above mere
trifling."


PRESS.

"Mr. Pennell writes so well that we wish he would take the trouble to
write better. He possesses humour and the 'fatal facility' of rhyming....
The _Night Mail North_ and the Derby Day are the two best poems."


ST. JAMES'S CHRONICLE.

"Easy running verses, the music of which is as sweet as their rhymes are
ingenious and unexpected."


COURT CIRCULAR.

"This is certainly one of the cleverest productions of the day, and gives
the clearest evidence of the genius of its author in almost every page."


LONDON REVIEW.

"...The popularity the work has already obtained, serves to show that
the author's  desi res have been crowned with success."


ORIENTAL BUDGET.

"Mr. Pennell has caught the spirit, as well as the style, of the different
poets he imitates, while his lines have an elegance, mid a sly bo-peep sort
of beauty.... The nick-names and mock climax in the song of _In-the--
Water_, are in their way inimitable imitations.... The Author, however,
gives proofs of far higher powers than those of mimicry."

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

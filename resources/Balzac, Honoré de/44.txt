GAUDISSART II.


To know how to sell, to be able to sell, and to sell. People generally
do not suspect how much of the stateliness of Paris is due to these
three aspects of the same problem. The brilliant display of shops as
rich as the salons of the noblesse before 1789; the splendors of cafes
which eclipse, and easily eclipse, the Versailles of our day; the
shop-window illusions, new every morning, nightly destroyed; the grace
and elegance of the young men that come in contact with fair customers;
the piquant faces and costumes of young damsels, who cannot fail to
attract the masculine customer; and (and this especially of late)
the length, the vast spaces, the Babylonish luxury of galleries where
shopkeepers acquire a monopoly of the trade in various articles by
bringing them all together,--all this is as nothing. Everything, so far,
has been done to appeal to a single sense, and that the most exacting
and jaded human faculty, a faculty developed ever since the days of the
Roman Empire, until, in our own times, thanks to the efforts of the most
fastidious civilization the world has yet seen, its demands are grown
limitless. That faculty resides in the "eyes of Paris."

Those eyes require illuminations costing a hundred thousand francs, and
many-colored glass palaces a couple of miles long and sixty feet high;
they must have a fairyland at some fourteen theatres every night, and a
succession of panoramas and exhibitions of the triumphs of art; for them
a whole world of suffering and pain, and a universe of joy, must resolve
through the boulevards or stray through the streets of Paris; for them
encyclopaedias of carnival frippery and a score of illustrated books are
brought out every year, to say nothing of caricatures by the hundred,
and vignettes, lithographs, and prints by the thousand. To please those
eyes, fifteen thousand francs' worth of gas must blaze every night; and,
to conclude, for their delectation the great city yearly spends several
millions of francs in opening up views and planting trees. And even yet
this is as nothing--it is only the material side of the question; in
truth, a mere trifle compared with the expenditure of brain power on the
shifts, worthy of Moliere, invented by some sixty thousand assistants
and forty thousand damsels of the counter, who fasten upon the
customer's purse, much as myriads of Seine whitebait fall upon a chance
crust floating down the river.

Gaudissart in the mart is at least the equal of his illustrious
namesake, now become the typical commercial traveler. Take him away from
his shop and his line of business, he is like a collapsed balloon; only
among his bales of merchandise do his faculties return, much as an actor
is sublime only upon the boards. A French shopman is better educated
than his fellows in other European countries; he can at need talk
asphalt, Bal Mabille, polkas, literature, illustrated books, railways,
politics, parliament, and revolution; transplant him, take away his
stage, his yardstick, his artificial graces; he is foolish beyond
belief; but on his own boards, on the tight-rope of the counter, as he
displays a shawl with a speech at his tongue's end, and his eye on his
customer, he puts the great Talleyrand into the shade; he is a match for
a Monrose and a Moliere to boot. Talleyrand in his own house would
have outwitted Gaudissart, but in the shop the parts would have been
reversed.

An incident will illustrate the paradox.

Two charming duchesses were chatting with the above-mentioned great
diplomatist. The ladies wished for a bracelet; they were waiting for the
arrival of a man from a great Parisian jeweler. A Gaudissart accordingly
appeared with three bracelets of marvelous workmanship. The great ladies
hesitated. Choice is a mental lightning flash; hesitate--there is no
more to be said, you are at fault. Inspiration in matters of taste will
not come twice. At last, after about ten minutes the Prince was called
in. He saw the two duchesses confronting doubt with its thousand facets,
unable to decide between the transcendent merits of two of the trinkets,
for the third had been set aside at once. Without leaving his book,
without a glance at the bracelets, the Prince looked at the jeweler's
assistant.

"Which would you choose for your sweetheart?" asked he.

The young man indicated one of the pair.

"In that case, take the other, you will make two women happy," said the
subtlest of modern diplomatists, "and make your sweetheart happy too, in
my name."

The two fair ladies smiled, and the young shopman took his departure,
delighted with the Prince's present and the implied compliment to his
taste.

A woman alights from her splendid carriage before one of the expensive
shops where shawls are sold in the Rue Vivienne. She is not alone; women
almost always go in pairs on these expeditions; always make the round
of half a score of shops before they make up their minds, and laugh
together in the intervals over the little comedies played for their
benefit. Let us see which of the two acts most in character--the fair
customer or the seller, and which has the best of it in such miniature
vaudevilles?

If you attempt to describe a sale, the central fact of Parisian trade,
you are in duty bound, if you attempt to give the gist of the matter,
to produce a type, and for this purpose a shawl or a chatelaine costing
some three thousand francs is a more exacting purchase than a length of
lawn or dress that costs three hundred. But know, oh foreign visitors
from the Old World and the New (if ever this study of the physiology
of the Invoice should be by you perused), that this selfsame comedy is
played in haberdashers' shops over a barege at two francs or a printed
muslin at four francs the yard.

And you, princess, or simple citizen's wife, whichever you may be, how
should you distrust that good-looking, very young man, with those frank,
innocent eyes, and a cheek like a peach covered with down? He is dressed
almost as well as your--cousin, let us say. His tones are soft as the
woolen stuffs which he spreads before you. There are three or four more
of his like. One has dark eyes, a decided expression, and an imperial
manner of saying, "This is what you wish"; another, that blue-eyed
youth, diffident of manner and meek of speech, prompts the remark, "Poor
boy! he was not born for business"; a third, with light auburn hair, and
laughing tawny eyes, has all the lively humor, and activity, and gaiety
of the South; while the fourth, he of the tawny red hair and fan-shaped
beard, is rough as a communist, with his portentous cravat, his
sternness, his dignity, and curt speech.

These varieties of shopmen, corresponding to the principal types of
feminine customers, are arms, as it were, directed by the head, a stout
personage with a full-blown countenance, a partially bald forehead, and
a chest measure befitting a Ministerialist deputy. Occasionally this
person wears the ribbon of the Legion of Honor in recognition of the
manner in which he supports the dignity of the French drapers' wand.
From the comfortable curves of his figure you can see that he has a wife
and family, a country house, and an account with the Bank of France. He
descends like a _deus ex machina_, whenever a tangled problem demands a
swift solution. The feminine purchasers are surrounded on all sides
with urbanity, youth, pleasant manners, smiles, and jests; the most
seeming-simple human products of civilization are here, all sorted in
shades to suit all tastes.

Just one word as to the natural effects of architecture, optical
science, and house decoration; one short, decisive, terrible word, of
history made on the spot. The work which contains this instructive page
is sold at number 76 Rue de Richelieu, where above an elegant shop, all
white and gold and crimson velvet, there is an entresol into which
the light pours straight from the Rue de Menars, as into a painter's
studio--clean, clear, even daylight. What idler in the streets has not
beheld the Persian, that Asiatic potentate, ruffling it above the door
at the corner of the Rue de la Bourse and the Rue de Richelieu, with a
message to deliver _urbi et orbi_, "Here I reign more tranquilly than at
Lahore"? Perhaps but for this immortal analytical study, archaeologists
might begin to puzzle their heads about him five hundred years hence,
and set about writing quartos with plates (like M. Quatremere's work
on Olympian Jove) to prove that Napoleon was something of a Sofi in the
East before he became "Emperor of the French." Well, the wealthy shop
laid siege to the poor little entresol; and after a bombardment with
banknotes, entered and took possession. The Human Comedy gave way before
the comedy of cashmeres. The Persian sacrificed a diamond or two from
his crown to buy that so necessary daylight; for a ray of sunlight shows
the play of the colors, brings out the charms of a shawl, and doubles
its value; 'tis an irresistible light; literally, a golden ray. From
this fact you may judge how far Paris shops are arranged with a view to
effect.

But to return to the young assistants, to the beribboned man of forty
whom the King of the French receives at his table, to the red-bearded
head of the department with his autocrat's air. Week by week these
meritus Gaudissarts are brought in contact with whims past counting;
they know every vibration of the cashmere chord in the heart of
woman. No one, be she lady or lorette, a young mother of a family, a
respectable tradesman's wife, a woman of easy virtue, a duchess or a
brazen-fronted ballet-dancer, an innocent young girl or a too innocent
foreigner, can appear in the shop, but she is watched from the moment
when she first lays her fingers upon the door-handle. Her measure is
taken at a glance by seven or eight men that stand, in the windows,
at the counter, by the door, in a corner, in the middle of the shop,
meditating, to all appearance, on the joys of a bacchanalian Sunday
holiday. As you look at them, you ask yourself involuntarily, "What can
they be thinking about?" Well, in the space of one second, a woman's
purse, wishes, intentions, and whims are ransacked more thoroughly
than a traveling carriage at a frontier in an hour and three-quarters.
Nothing is lost on these intelligent rogues. As they stand, solemn
as noble fathers on the stage, they take in all the details of a
fair customer's dress; an invisible speck of mud on a little shoe, an
antiquated hat-brim, soiled or ill-judged bonnet-strings, the fashion of
the dress, the age of a pair of gloves. They can tell whether the gown
was cut by the intelligent scissors of a Victorine IV.; they know a
modish gewgaw or a trinket from Froment-Meurice. Nothing, in short,
which can reveal a woman's quality, fortune, or character passes
unremarked.

Tremble before them. Never was the Sanhedrim of Gaudissarts, with
their chief at their head, known to make a mistake. And, moreover, they
communicate their conclusions to one another with telegraphic speed, in
a glance, a smile, the movement of a muscle, a twitch of the lip. If you
watch them, you are reminded of the sudden outbreak of light along
the Champs-Elysees at dusk; one gas-jet does not succeed another more
swiftly than an idea flashes from one shopman's eyes to the next.

At once, if the lady is English, the dark, mysterious, portentous
Gaudissart advances like a romantic character out of one of Byron's
poems.

If she is a city madam, the oldest is put forward. He brings out a
hundred shawls in fifteen minutes; he turns her head with colors and
patterns; every shawl that he shows her is like a circle described by a
kite wheeling round a hapless rabbit, till at the end of half an hour,
when her head is swimming and she is utterly incapable of making a
decision for herself, the good lady, meeting with a flattering response
to all her ideas, refers the question to the assistant, who promptly
leaves her on the horns of a dilemma between two equally irresistible
shawls.

"This, madame, is very becoming--apple-green, the color of the season;
still, fashions change; while as for this other black-and-white shawl
(an opportunity not to be missed), you will never see the end of it, and
it will go with any dress."

This is the A B C of the trade.

"You would not believe how much eloquence is wanted in that beastly
line," the head Gaudissart of this particular establishment remarked
quite lately to two acquaintances (Duronceret and Bixiou) who had come
trusting in his judgment to buy a shawl. "Look here; you are artists and
discreet, I can tell you about the governor's tricks, and of all the men
I ever saw, he is the cleverest. I do not mean as a manufacturer, there
M. Fritot is first; but as a salesman. He discovered the 'Selim shawl,'
_an absolutely unsalable_ article, yet we never bring it out but we
sell it. We keep always a shawl worth five or six hundred francs in a
cedar-wood box, perfectly plain outside, but lined with satin. It is
one of the shawls that Selim sent to the Emperor Napoleon. It is our
Imperial Guard; it is brought to the front whenever the day is almost
lost; _il se vend et ne meurt pas_--it sells its life dearly time after
time."

As he spoke, an Englishwoman stepped from her jobbed carriage and
appeared in all the glory of that phlegmatic humor peculiar to
Britain and to all its products which make believe they are alive. The
apparition put you in mind of the Commandant's statue in Don Juan, it
walked along, jerkily by fits and starts, in an awkward fashion invented
in London, and cultivated in every family with patriotic care.

"An Englishwoman!" he continued for Bixiou's ear. "An Englishwoman is
our Waterloo. There are women who slip through our fingers like eels; we
catch them on the staircase. There are lorettes who chaff us, we join
in the laugh, we have a hold on them because we give credit. There
are sphinx-like foreign ladies; we take a quantity of shawls to
their houses, and arrive at an understanding by flattery; but an
Englishwoman!--you might as well attack the bronze statue of Louis
Quatorze! That sort of woman turns shopping into an occupation, an
amusement. She quizzes us, forsooth!"

The romantic assistant came to the front.

"Does madame wish for real Indian shawls or French, something expensive
or----"

"I will see." (_Je veraie_.)

"How much would madame propose----"

"I will see."

The shopman went in quest of shawls to spread upon the mantle-stand,
giving his colleagues a significant glance. "What a bore!" he said
plainly, with an almost imperceptible shrug of the shoulders.

"These are our best quality in Indian red, blue, and pale orange--all at
ten thousand francs. Here are shawls at five thousand francs, and others
at three."

The Englishwoman took up her eyeglass and looked round the room with
gloomy indifference; then she submitted the three stands to the same
scrutiny, and made no sign.

"Have you any more?" (_Havaivod'hote_?) demanded she.

"Yes, madame. But perhaps madame has not quite decided to take a shawl?"

"Oh, quite decided" (_trei-deycidai_).

The young man went in search of cheaper wares. These he spread out
solemnly as if they were things of price, saying by his manner, "Pay
attention to all this magnificence!"

"These are much more expensive," said he. "They have never been worn;
they have come by courier direct from the manufacturers at Lahore."

"Oh! I see," said she; "they are much more like the thing I want."

The shopman kept his countenance in spite of inward irritation, which
communicated itself to Duronceret and Bixiou. The Englishwoman, cool as
a cucumber, appeared to rejoice in her phlegmatic humor.

"What price?" she asked, indicating a sky-blue shawl covered with a
pattern of birds nestling in pagodas.

"Seven thousand francs."

She took it up, wrapped it about her shoulders, looked in the glass, and
handed it back again.

"No, I do not like it at all." (_Je n'ame pouinte_.)

A long quarter of an hour went by in trying on other shawls; to no
purpose.

"This is all we have, madame," said the assistant, glancing at the
master as he spoke.

"Madame is fastidious, like all persons of taste," said the head of the
establishment, coming forward with that tradesman's suavity in which
pomposity is agreeably blended with subservience. The Englishwoman
took up her eyeglass and scanned the manufacturer from head to foot,
unwilling to understand that the man before her was eligible for
Parliament and dined at the Tuileries.

"I have only one shawl left," he continued, "but I never show it. It is
not to everybody's taste; it is quite out of the common. I was thinking
of giving it to my wife. We have had it in stock since 1805; it belonged
to the Empress Josephine."

"Let me see it, monsieur."

"Go for it," said the master, turning to a shopman. "It is at my house."

"I should be very much pleased to see it," said the English lady.

This was a triumph. The splenetic dame was apparently on the point of
going. She made as though she saw nothing but the shawls; but all
the while she furtively watched the shopmen and the two customers,
sheltering her eyes behind the rims of her eyeglasses.

"It cost sixty thousand francs in Turkey, madame."

"Oh!" (_hau_!)

"It is one of seven shawls which Selim sent, before his fall, to the
Emperor Napoleon. The Empress Josephine, a Creole, as you know, my
lady, and very capricious in her tastes, exchanged this one for another
brought by the Turkish ambassador, and purchased by my predecessor;
but I have never seen the money back. Our ladies in France are not rich
enough; it is not as it is in England. The shawl is worth seven thousand
francs; and taking interest and compound interest altogether, it makes
up fourteen or fifteen thousand by now--"

"How does it make up?" asked the Englishwoman.

"Here it is, madame."

With precautions, which a custodian of the Dresden _Grune Gewolbe_
might have admired, he took out an infinitesimal key and opened a square
cedar-wood box. The Englishwoman was much impressed with its shape and
plainness. From that box, lined with black satin, he drew a shawl worth
about fifteen hundred francs, a black pattern on a golden-yellow ground,
of which the startling color was only surpassed by the surprising
efforts of the Indian imagination.

"Splendid," said the lady, in a mixture of French and English, "it
is really handsome. Just my ideal" (_ideol_) "of a shawl; it is very
magnificent." The rest was lost in a madonna's pose assumed for the
purpose of displaying a pair of frigid eyes which she believed to be
very fine.

"It was a great favorite with the Emperor Napoleon; he took----"

"A great favorite," repeated she with her English accent. Then she
arranged the shawl about her shoulders and looked at herself in the
glass. The proprietor took it to the light, gathered it up in his hands,
smoothed it out, showed the gloss on it, played on it as Liszt plays on
the pianoforte keys.

"It is very fine; beautiful, sweet!" said the lady, as composedly as
possible.

Duronceret, Bixiou, and the shopmen exchanged amused glances. "The shawl
is sold," they thought.

"Well, madame?" inquired the proprietor, as the Englishwoman appeared to
be absorbed in meditations infinitely prolonged.

"Decidedly," said she; "I would rather have a carriage" (_une voteure_).

All the assistants, listening with silent rapt attention, started as one
man, as if an electric shock had gone through them.

"I have a very handsome one, madame," said the proprietor with unshaken
composure; "it belonged to a Russian princess, the Princess Narzicof;
she left it with me in payment for goods received. If madame would like
to see it, she would be astonished. It is new; it has not been in use
altogether for ten days; there is not its like in Paris."

The shopmen's amazement was suppressed by profound admiration.

"I am quite willing."

"If madame will keep the shawl," suggested the proprietor, "she can try
the effect in the carriage." And he went for his hat and gloves.

"How will this end?" asked the head assistant, as he watched his
employer offer an arm to the English lady and go down with her to the
jobbed brougham.

By this time the thing had come to be as exciting as the last chapter of
a novel for Duronceret and Bixiou, even without the additional interest
attached to all contests, however trifling, between England and France.

Twenty minutes later the proprietor returned.

"Go to the Hotel Lawson (here is the card, 'Mrs. Noswell'), and take an
invoice that I will give you. There are six thousand francs to take."

"How did you do it?" asked Duronceret, bowing before the king of
invoices.

"Oh, I saw what she was, an eccentric woman that loves to be
conspicuous. As soon as she saw that every one stared at her, she said,
'Keep your carriage, monsieur, my mind is made up; I will take the
shawl.' While M. Bigorneau (indicating the romantic-looking assistant)
was serving, I watched her carefully; she kept one eye on you all the
time to see what you thought of her; she was thinking more about you
than of the shawls. Englishwomen are peculiar in their _distaste_ (for
one cannot call it taste); they do not know what they want; they make up
their minds to be guided by circumstances at the time, and not by their
own choice. I saw the kind of woman at once, tired of her husband, tired
of her brats, regretfully virtuous, craving excitement, always posing as
a weeping willow...."

These were his very words.

Which proves that in all other countries of the world a shopkeeper is
a shopkeeper; while in France, and in Paris more particularly, he is a
student from a College Royal, a well-read man with a taste for art, or
angling, or the theatre, and consumed, it may be, with a desire to be
M. Cunin-Gridaine's successor, or a colonel of the National Guard, or
a member of the General Council of the Seine, or a referee in the
Commercial Court.

"M. Adolphe," said the mistress of the establishment, addressing the
slight fair-haired assistant, "go to the joiner and order another
cedar-wood box."

"And now," remarked the shopman who had assisted Duronceret and Bixiou
to choose a shawl for Mme. Schontz, "_now_ we will go through our old
stock to find another Selim shawl."

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

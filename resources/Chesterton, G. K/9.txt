INTRODUCTORY REMARKS


    The Art of Biography
    Is different from Geography.
    Geography is about Maps,
    But Biography is about Chaps.

SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN


    Sir Christopher Wren
    Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
    "If anybody calls
    "Say I am designing St. Paul's."

[Illustration]




MIGUEL DE CERVANTES


    The people of Spain think Cervantes
    Equal to half-a-dozen Dantes:

    By the people of Italy.

[Illustration]




GEORGE BERNARD SHAW


    Mr Bernard Shaw

SIR HUMPHREY DAVY

    John Stuart Mill,
    By a mighty effort of will,

    And wrote "Principles of Political Economy."

[Illustration]




FRANÇOIS LISZT


    The Abbé Liszt
    Hit the piano with his fist.
    That was the way
    He used to play.

[Illustration]




LORD CLIVE


    What I like about Clive
    Is that he is no longer alive.
    There is a great deal to be said
    For being dead.

[Illustration]




KING EDWARD THE CONFESSOR


    Edward the Confessor
    Slept under the dresser.
    When that began to pall,
    He slept in the hall.

 THE REV. JOHN CLIFFORD
 M.A., LL.B., D.D.

[Illustration]




KARL MARX

    The poor creatures seriously missed him
    While he was attacking the capitalist system.

[Illustration]




OTTO THE GREAT


    The great Emperor Otto
    Could not decide upon a motto.
    His mind wavered between
    "L'Etat C'est Moi" and "Ich Dien."

[Illustration]




MARCONI

[Illustration]




DAVID HUME


    That you have all heard of Hume
    I tacitly assume;

    That his parents were Lapps.

[Illustration]




MR H. BELLOC


    Mr Hilaire Belloc

    His opinion of Leviathan.

[Illustration]




PIZARRO


    The views of Pizarro
    Were perhaps a little narrow.
    He killed the Caciques
    Because (he said) they were sneaks.

[Illustration]




 THE DUKE OF FIFE
 K.T., P.C., G.C.V.O.


    It looked bad when the Duke of Fife
    Left off using a knife;
    But people began to talk
    When he left off using a fork.

[Illustration]




THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON


    The great Duke of Wellington
    Reduced himself to a skellington.
    He reached seven stone two,
    And then----Waterloo!

[Illustration]




JOHN BUNYAN


    I do not extenuate Bunyan's
    Intemperate use of onions,
    But if I knew a wicked ogress
    I would lend her "The Pilgrim's Progress."

[Illustration]




GEORGE HIRST


    When I faced the bowling of Hirst
    I ejaculated, "Do your worst!"

    Sir Walter Raleigh
    Bickered down the valley.

CIMABUE


    When they told Cimabue
    He didn't know how to cooee,

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

ROBERT HARLEY, EARL OF OXFORD

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
